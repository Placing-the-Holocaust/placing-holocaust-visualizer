<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your friends when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  If you mean from, from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ...because I have only two friends left from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> situation, when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrect</span> , and I still have them, but I think that, that my best friends I, uh, had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> when I started, uh, started studying and I, I've lived now for fifty years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , so I really I'm really <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Hoog, a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of several levels; a high-rise single-family residence.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, I think that the intellectual environment where I lived, the whole, uh, situation with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...most of us were quite aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were aware of the danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We were afraid of what would happen, although no one of course expected what afterwards happened, but I must say that in, in, in my, my people with whom I, uh, talked and, and worked--they were absolutely aware of the bad situation in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the bad situation of the Jews and of course don't forget that in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in the years from from '35 on, we had so many refugees, Jewish refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> you really were...you...you couldn't, uh, not, not notice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The, the people lived there 1n the south, especially in the south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and some of them stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Some of them went to, to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , part of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">One thing I, I always remember...you know, I'm, I'm, I'm interested in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And even....as a, as a student I was interested in <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , and just before the war...ya, just before the war, many artists from the <span class="BUILDING">cabaret</span> , from the state, from the film, fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and as I said, some, some went afterwards to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , but some of them stayed here and I, I've seen all the big names of the...of the actors and the Cabaretiers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , which is...which I would never have seen in my life and 1t was unbelievable because they were really top people, and I remember that they had the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> where every fortnight they brought a new program. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was absolutely unbelievable!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Were there any plays in particular or musicals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I think it, 1t was just more intimate revues; most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Most of them were in intimate revues in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But apart from that, they were well-known actors in German films. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And as you know, German films completely collapsed when Hitler came.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  And so your friends who were students were also members of this party?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yes, I think that most of them were were interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Not all of them, but most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And they had many Jewish friends, so they they, they were, of course, interested in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Uh, is there is a memory of any friend, any one friend or any several friends in particular, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well...J mean in '42--nay, in'41 I was studying with a friend, Jewish friend, uh, and we had lessons for, for law. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You, you did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And, uh, we were sitting together in, in a...what do you call it? ...</span><span class="sentence" id="88">Not a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , but, uh, a meeting place for students. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then he was called on the telephone and he was asked by his parents to come immediately <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They didn't say why. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So he said, "Well, I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ," and, and he left and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And, uh, when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he was arrested and taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And that was the first group of young Jewish boys...1t was in'41 before the general, uh, pick-up of all the, all the, all the Jewish people, in '41, and they were all young, young people...young, uh, boys and they sent them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> somewhere north of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , just...they said a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But of course we all knew it was just a a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> , and no one has every heard of the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I'm sure they had been sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Was your life affected by the invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Well, of course everyone's life was affected...I mean if you're occupied, you're occupied, and I'm no different...l was no different from the other ones in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  What happened to you after the invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE
QUESTION:  What happened to you after the invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  I finished my, uh, my Greek and Latin studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I started studying law at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  What were the effects of, uh, the anti-Jewish laws on the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Would you repeat that question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Do you remember or can you describe any of the effects of the anti-Jewish laws that were passed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> when the Germans came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Ya, but you... mustn't forget that...the passing of the anti-Jewish laws was gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They, they didn't immediately, uh, pass laws, for instance, that the Jews couldn't, uh, go into <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> or couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> or couldn't go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That came gradually during the years, so they they, they, they ...every month they made a new move towards the, the isolation of the Jews and of course that, that... think that the the...and of course we had the February thing, which you remember, was the strike which was absolutely an illogical strike about, about, about the Jews, and afterwards I think that from '42, from the summer of '42 when the real razzias started, then the feelings really went very high against the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Did you or your family members or any close friends try to leave Europe at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  I didn't finish my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Uh, I..the, the law...law studies in two separate parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">One is for two years and the other is three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">First is two years and then you get what we call Kandidaatsexam. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And in '42, I, I did, uh, Kandidaats-exam, so I had finished my first part of of my studies and then I stopped, because at that time the, the, the...in July...June and July of '42, the razzias, uh, uh, razzias were all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So that moment I, I stopped studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  And then I, I with the Utrecht students, we had, uh, an organization to, to save as many Jewish children as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We specialized only on, on children, not on adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That had a reason too, because, uh, we we thought we could better, uh, stay, uh, stay only with the children because if we had...of course you have many, many many times that you have to look for <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for adults, but we gave them to other kinds of organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Everyone had his own <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think that that's very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  A resistance organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  To a sister organization, or a organization who specialized in in hiding adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Did your group have a name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Because...well, we say the "Utrecht Group" and the "Amsterdam Group"--"Student Group." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We didn't have...why should we have a name? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh, it was not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the less you...we all lived under another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My name in the oorlog” was Piet van Doorn, and I lived under that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I didn't ...I couldn't live under my own name because that was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We all had another name, and we, we didn't want to have too much contact with other groups because the more contacts you had, the more vulnerable you were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your work when you first began in the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Well, we, we, we really began to...because the the Utrecht students...they were before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They, they, they, they were, uh, trying to get, uh, children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> ” and as they were living in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , it was fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They always had to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It's not so far, but anyway...they weren't living here, so they contacted us and they said, if, 1f, uh, we should collaborate..." You, you look for the children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You know the families," and because we didn't only have children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We had children right from the, from the parents too of course and that goes mouth by mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I mean someone knew that we were taking care of children and, uh, they informed the parents and we got...contacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was not only the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But they asked us and that's why, why we we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They couldn't handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was too much, and they asked us to, to uh, fetch the children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and fetch other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, sometimes we hided the children ourselves or we gave them to Utrecht organization--independent who, who had <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but in...let's say a year later we were completely independent and they had their own organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We worked together but we, we looked for <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  So you were immediately thrown into this work when you joined the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  You said that the group separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">About how many people did you work with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Uh, there were only two men, my partner and I, and all the others one were girls, and that was logical because, uh, we couldn't travel with children at our age. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We were about twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And at that age, it was very suspicious to sit in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I mean...of course as a Jew it was very dangerous, but in that, that period, all men about twenty years of age were very afraid to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because the, the Groen Politie,’ the German police, trapped all the * Pieter Meerburg's group was known as the Amsterdam Students Group. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">° War. * </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The day-care center, the place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> where infants and children were brought and cared for while awaiting deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">> Green Police, so named because of the color of their uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">time all kinds of young boys from my age and took them, and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work, so it was already dangerous just to sit into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So that was one of the reasons why we had...the girls, they were never picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I mean they, they left the girls alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So all the, all the transport of the children had to be done by, by the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Sometimes I went with them to get them, but that's, that's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Then they were there and it was their child and what we...my partner and I did...we were looking...we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> , to the north, and looking for contacts, and to look for <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We went to the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We were organizers, you see, but the actual transport was done by the, by the girls.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Joodse Raad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  To a certain extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">In my opinion the Jewish Council consists of, of, of the two managing directors, Asscher and Cohen,” and a whole staff of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Most of them were relatives or friends of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The Jewish Council had the responsibility for the <span class="BUILDING">Hollandse Schouwburg</span> --the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> where the Jews were brought to be sent to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They were assembled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Now, in in the Jewish Council, in my opinion, there were two kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">One people were just obeying all the orders of the Germans, trying to save their own lives as much possible, and another part which realized that being a member of the Jewish Council, they had to sabotage as much as possible and to, to use the the, the power they had, given them by the Germans, to, to free as many children and adults as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Well, it was with these people I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Not with Asscher and Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And for instance, you know, Walter SiiBkind,’ Felix Halverstad’”...they were Jews who worked for the Auswanderung'! </span><span class="sentence" id="215">or Ausstellung. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That was a a part of the Jewish Council supervised by the Germans, by aus der Fiinten,'* and, uh, they were the right people. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They were very brave, and they looked after...they sent their children to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , and they took care that we...they asked us to take the children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But at the same time they let a lot of adults free by, by falsifying papers and letting them suddenly out of the <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They, they they did marvelous work. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They were absolutely fabulous, because in, in that position to do that, is is risking your neck every second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  So you had no major contacts then with Asscher and Cohen with your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I had no contacts with Asscher and Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I was once threatened by Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I had, uh, I'm very unhappy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He he threatened me that if I wouldn't bring back a child which I hid, he would announce...denounce me, and I brought the child back. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That was my only contact with Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I never had any contact anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I never wanted to have any contact with him. * </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Abraham Asscher and Professor David Cohen, the two leaders of the Dutch Jewish Council located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . ” </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One of the Jewish Council's administrative staff who helped save some Jewish lives, particularly children, by removing papers from German files documenting the Jewish population.

<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He was a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Was there something about that one child? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Did it belong to...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  He, he, he didn't agree that...it, it was a child which we...which the Council itself had asked us...a member of the Council...to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And it...I think it's...there was an internal fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The woman who had asked us...was not...he didn't agree that she she asked us that, so when the child...when I hid the child, he was so furious and he said to the woman, "You tell Piet van Doorn if he doesn't bring back the child, I, I, I'll denounce him."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  And then what would happen if you were denounced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Well, that would mean all my, my, my people...1t was not so much for myself, but the danger of being caught was always that you would be tortured and you would talk and would give away everything you know, so the whole organization was, was in danger at that time--if one of us would have been caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  If he denounced you, in other words, would you have been turned over to the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  To the Germans, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That was his intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  I know that your work was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Were there any moments in particular that were more dangerous than others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I, I, I think that if you live with danger for three years, you don't realize it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I mean you know it in the back of your head, but you, you, you can't live with that when when you...every every...when you realize every minute that you're in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Of course, I, I, I had one or two very natrow escapes, but we all had. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It's eighty percent luck that you come through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the narrow escapes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, the narrowest escape I had was, uh, we had a contact in the head of the, the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He was the big boss in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> , and I...he was...he was a very good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">My, my son 1s still called, is named after him, and he, uh...suddenly there was a very, uh, uh, someone was caught and he was, he was talking, and he knew too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So the whole group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> had to, to hide and had to change addresses and go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> because at first in fact, he knew everything, the man, and he, he betrayed the whole thing, so, so he went to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amersfoort</span> , which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , and he let me know that he was there and he asked me to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I had an appointment with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amersfoort</span> , on the <span class="DLF">street</span> not in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And he said, "Well, would you, I, I need a new persoonbewijjs, identity card." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And he gave me his photo and he said, "Uh, please take care of it, and give me a very good one." </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And of course we had our contacts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , people who were printing...who had original identity cards, but only for the top people in the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I went there and I, I made his, uh...I got his new identity card, and I had, uh, a rendezvous with him at six o'clock on a certain day in, uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amersfoort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Only, only on a address, but I was very, uh, upset about it because it was so...he was...he was the most man the Germans looked for in the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I asked the girls whom I lived with at the time, "Go with me and and take the identity card, because if I'm caught with that"...I could have been caught just as, as a twenty-year old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That had nothing to do with my...and then I would have...then there would have been the possibility that the identity card would be lost and I would be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or something, but that was not the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The question was I wanted him to have that identity card and I, I had the feeling that it was very dangerous, so I said to her, 'Take...you go with me and let's go together, and you, you carry the, the identity card." </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And just before the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , she broke the shoe...the, the, the lace of her shoe, and I was mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Now what happened actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amersfoort</span> was that at one o'clock the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, uh, complete...completely circled...uh, how do you call it?... </span><span class="sentence" id="275">circled...by, by very, uh, well-armed German troops because he was so...that important, and, uh, they, they, they, uh, they rang the bell and they said he got...and the man who, who, who did it said, "I have a message from Esme," which is one of the... which was a good way to, to, to go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Because he didn't suspect anything at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">At that moment he, he came in and, uh, two minutes later he knew he was trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So he took...he tried to take his revolver and, uh....
QUESTION:  What happened when he approached the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  When he approached the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> he was let in and after two minutes, uh, Krijn, which was his name--Krijn van den Helm, realized that he was trapped and he tried to, to, to...he had this revolver in back the of his trousers and he, and he reached for it and he got it on the wrong...the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the man who was sitting in front of him shot him [NB: Krin] dead immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  In other words, who shot who? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Just to clarify the situation with the two people involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Who was shot and who had the revolver?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But the the the strange thing is that normally when, when things like that happened, the Germans stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for twenty-four hours at least, to see what, what people came and they were caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That, that happened all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That was the biggest risk you had, that you walked to an address where the Germans had arrested someone, where they were still staying to look who was, who was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Now the funny...you know, the funny...the strange thing 1s, that they left at six o'clock and I arrived at, let's say, seven because of the fact that I had missed my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and then when I, when IJ, uh, rang the doorbell, she said, "Get out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="288">so I knew the whole thing was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Well, that, that was just a lucky escape and, and you know, you never know how, why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe, I wouldn't have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  You mentioned there was another narrow escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  The other narrow escape was with my partner who was, uh, caught at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> with all kinds of identity cards and, uh, and, uh, material which was absolutely very dangerous, but he was just caught as I tell you as a, as man, a boy of thirty years, twenty years, to be sent to to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But we didn't know if they had discovered all, all the material, so then the same man from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> , Krijn van den Helm, where I was just talking about...that was before he was killed... called him and said, What are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He's in...my partner Wouter's 1n <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I'm afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I don't know what he had, what he had with him." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he [NB: Krijn] came immediately to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And by time in '43 the Germans had a very strange law. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">All the students had to, uh, sign a loyal, uh, statement that they would be loyal to the German occu...occupation and German people or something like that, which was completely idiotic, because it was, it was a forced statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But they they were very tough on that because they said, "If you don't sign it, either you can't study on, and your parents, especially your father, is responsible," and a lot of students signed because they didn't want their father to be responsible for, uh, what, what, what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It didn't occur to us because we were not studying anymore in '43, so there were, uh, there were student cards of of people who had signed and I went with the...with Krijn van Helm to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where they they gave away this...where they had the, uh, this, this...what do you call it?...college identification card, and he threatened him that he would kill him if he didn't give him a book of these, uh, identity cards, and he gave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He immediately gave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So what we did, we, uh, put a photo of my partner on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was signed in his name, and his sister went to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and he was immediately freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So that was a narrow escape, not for me personally but anyway for the whole group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  But in '43, the situation for Jews...there were no Jews at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> then, were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">No Jews at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Why did you decide to get involved with the movement to begin with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  You don't decide that. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I think for me, uh, sheer honesty,...1t was when, when my friend was, uh, called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and disappeared forever, and then you say, "What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">You are studying law. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">This 1s ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There are so many other things which are much more important." </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I think that was the turning point for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And then, then it goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Don't forget, we saw razzias in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's a terrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean it's unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Can you describe one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It, it's...a whole block of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> 1s, 1s, is cut off by, by, by police and and army and they are going from every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , looking for everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Everyone has to, to...had, had a persoonbewyjs, and all Jews had a persoonbewijs with a J on it, so if you had not a persoonbewyjs without a J, or if you had no persoonbewijs, you are taken, uh, with them, but they, they went from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They didn't have the, the, the addresses of the Jewish people themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">No, they...that was the typical way they operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They took a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> and looked for the Jews...in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And, and then they brought them out, with children and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was a terrible thing to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  Do you know why there was no list?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  There was a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They, they they operated different. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Sometimes..but a real razzia, in my opinion, is a, uh, search of all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and not on a certain address. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Of course, they they, they, they, uh, took, uh, Jews from addresses, but that was individually. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They went to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with three or four people, and they... and they rang the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and they saw they were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But that's not the same as a razzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">A razzia 1s...they wanted to, to, to...because there were a lot of people already hiding 1n, in, in, in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so they, they found that too, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">If you had no identification, no persoonbewyjs, they took you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  When you would watch a razzia occurring, what would happen to the people that they would bring out of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  They, they, they, they were brought together and, and they went with them in, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cars</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And mostly they were taken immediately from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  Did you see... were there torturings during the razzias?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I, I don't think they were tortured at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And unfortunately it's not only the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The Dutch people, the Dutch police helped too. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It's unbelievable--but they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  The Dutch police helped who...??</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  The Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They, they did it together with the Germans, part of the police--not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">There are, of course, people who refused to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But part of them--they did it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  The situation changed because in September of '44, the south was liberated and the north where I lived, was not liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And then we had the toughest time for the population, because then we got what we called the "hongeren."" </span><span class="sentence" id="360">There was no food, no transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We couldn't reach the children anymore because they were in the south, and they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">In the north they were still there, but there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...uh, people who worked on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...striked, so you were completely insulated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You couldn't move out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Is there one or two, or even several incidents that stick out in your mind the most, about one of the children, or of your experiences helping the children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  There was one experience which I'll never forget in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">That I, I went to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joure</span> which is a Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It was...and there was a man with a laundry, and I heard that the man had a lot of addresses for adults, but for children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And he went...every Saturday he went to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with a, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he came back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joure</span> with, let's say, twenty or thirty adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he hided them in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , so I knew, and I wanted to talk to him, that he would give us addresses for children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So I went with with one of the girls to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joure</span> and we had two children with us which we wanted to hide, and he had agreed to, to, to, to help us, and okay...we arrived and we gave the children to him and he looked after them, but as it was already late, we couldn't go back to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was...after twelve you're not allowed to, to be on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , so we couldn't make it with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So we had to stay there, so we got...we stayed there and we got a very decent meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">For us it was very important to get "heel" [NB: Dutch word for "very"| good food, and he was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">After...after... dinner, I sat with him and we talked and then he suddenly said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He told me that he hated the Jews on religious ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They had killed Christians and by his faith, the Jews were his enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But, it is stated in the Bible, "You have to love your enemies." </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So that's why he did everything to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Now if I am telling it just now...it looks like a wierd story but at that moment it was a terrible story because I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I wondered what he was doing...if he was betraying...a traitor and sending all the the adults to the Germans and the children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I was absolutely frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I didn't sleep the whole night and neither did the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we got out as soon as possible, and we went to, to, to the head of the resistance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leeuwarden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And we said, My God, what do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Do you know that man? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Is he all right?" </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We informed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And it turned out finally he was all right, and after the war I, I spoke to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I said, "Do you '> Famine or "hongersnood." </span><span class="sentence" id="393">remember what you said to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You have scared the hell out of me because of, of what?" </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And he meant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He meant it, absolutely! </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He said, "Yes, but I, I..." Afterwards, he said, "I changed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I watched these Jews, the whole, uh, during the whole war and they are just like us, and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Did the women travel with you on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">If we were...sometimes I was going alone or if I...1f we were with children, then the girl...the girl and I always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">There was no problem about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Did you also help secure false documentation for the children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Well...no. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">No, nay. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That's not right, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The children didn't get any identification because the children were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They don't...didn't need, uh, identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Some of them, however, got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I remember a case of a baby which was just born and one of my girls went to, to, to the <span class="BUILDING">registration office</span> and told the officer that she had had a child and, uh, so the child was actually saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He had an official non-Jewish mother and the name of the mother, so we didn't have to hide the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We, we sent it to, to a family where she was brought up and she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  Then what happened to the child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  That's a very strange story because the girl who had adopted her or, or recognized it as, it as her as her son was one...was visiting the, the parents every...every month to give all kinds of things: coupons, uh, bread coupons, meat coupons....
QUESTION:  This was the child's natural mother visited the foster parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The, the foster parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And one day when she was there, the, the Gestapo, they came in, and there was another Jewish, uh, boy living there with the parents and, uh, well, uh, the, the Jewish boy was taken and the parents were taken and she said, "It's my child." </span><span class="sentence" id="421">She would prove it was her child, so they didn't take the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And the, the, the, the Gestapo said, "How can...how can you put your child with such a terrible, bad family who hides Jews and things like this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She says, "I didn't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So she took the, the boy with her, and the boy survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Funny thing is that after the war, it took her two years to get rid of the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The, the, the legal, uh, the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> didn't believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Would you visit the children at all once they were placed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  The girls did, but once in a while--not every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">That would be too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And for instance, we had a <span class="BUILDING">center</span> in, in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> , in the South, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tienray</span> where we had 120 children and where there was a Jewish student and some others who stayed there and took care of all the children, so there you didn't have to, to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We just brought the the children there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  And what kind of families were the children placed with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Never in wealthy families. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Always poor families. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">That's the strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Very...down to earth people, very nice people, very good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Sometimes religious people. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But... never in, in a family where there was money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  How did you find these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Well, through the...through the ministers, through the pastors, through all kind of contacts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  And the ministers and the pastors in the south in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> .... Were they willing to cooperate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Both the Catholics and the <span class="BUILDING">Reformed Church</span> helped enormously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  In one <span class="NPIP">case</span> together, but that didn't last long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  The children placed in the south...were they placed predominantly in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Protestant homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">religious homes</span> , non-religious homes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Uh, yeah...that's a question that you can only ask after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">In the war you never asked what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">If you had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , you had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">You didn't ask what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We didn't care where...we were too happy to have an address. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If they were Hindostaans ...it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The only thing which we took care of especially, because our south connection...we had to deal with the Bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , that the children were not to be, uh, bap...baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Of course, the children had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Otherwise it would be too suspicious, and the children loved the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It's, it's really a great show, you know (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So there was always the danger that they, they, they wanted to be baptized and and some of the the, the pastors would have loved to do that, but from, from the Bishop there was absolutely a, a, uh...1t was forbidden to, to do that and in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tienray</span> where we had these...all these children, there was not one baptism. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There have been cases, of course, that pastors disobeyed the orders of the Bishop and there there will be some baptized, but it was absolutely minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Why did you decide first to work with helping to save the children rather than adults? '* </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Hindus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  No...it didn't happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We were approached by the Utrecht people about the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So we have from the beginning in, in, in... we were working with the children and we knew that we, we couldn't do both. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">That would be absolutely impossible and we realized that if we had...there were...there were so many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">If, if, if 1 give you an example...I think that all the groups together...three or four groups, had 1200 children, which is peanuts compared to how many children there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We couldn't do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I mean it was...1t was such a short time and you...so you have to concentrate on, on, on, on the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">If, if we didn't do it, we could...you would have done the work for children half and the work for adults half, so we decide very soon with the Utrecht group to...that we'd in principle only take care of children and let the adults be, uh, uh, hided by, by other other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Was it harder working with the Utrecht group, since the NSB’° was headquartered there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I lived in front of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the SD Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was even more better because (laughter)...yeah...just...when I looked out of my <span class="DLF">window</span> I could see the, the, the where the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , now, the Gerrit van de Veenstraat, then, the Erteupestraat, and it was the most safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could could be, so that doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Were you ever suspected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">L...after the war, records of the Germans--and there has been exhibition about it--gave a complete diagram of all the groups, with our names on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They absolutely knew...they only didn't know where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That, that was the good thing, but I think that the, the Germans were very well informed about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  Were you or your girls ever personally suspected by them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  Yeah, but they knew, uh, uh, Piet van Doorn, but they didn't know that, that 1t was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I think it worked that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  What was the way in which, in other words, the procedure for you to get the children from the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> and then give them to the women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  I don't understand what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  How did you.... In other words, how were the children taken from the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> then to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I know they were taken... '° The Nationaal Socialistische Beweging (National Socialist Movement), organized by Anton Adriaan Mussert in 1931, functioned as the Dutch Nazi Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Now the, the the children were...
QUESTION:  From the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , rather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  The children were...when, when the family was picked up, adults went to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> and the children went immediately to, to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They didn't...the children didn't stay at the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  I realize that...
ANSWER:  They were not really allowed to be in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  But how were the children taken from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> ...
ANSWER:  From all kinds of...by all kinds of methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  In the morning there was a <span class="DLF">back door</span> through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and we took the, the, the, the, the children from...by the <span class="DLF">back door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And we went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Sometimes the, the, the nurses, like Virrie Cohen, and so on, took the children on walk and we took them when they were walking, took two or three, and they came back with two or three less or four less, let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There were all kinds of methods to to get them out of the, the, the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  After your work with the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> when there were no more children, the children were hidden, did you work with the adults then, helping adults?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Because the, the, the, the...it's a mis...a misunderstanding that...that the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was the most important, uh, source of getting children. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I mean it was "A" source and some of the groups had more children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> than the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">There were always, uh, parents who wanted to, who who were hiding, who were not hid...hiding and who wanted to hide...it was very difficult to hide with your children so then they they contacted us and we took the child one or two, and, and, and took it away, so it's, it's not only the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It's, it's...you took it right from the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">That was one of the reasons why I think we could do the job, because we were young and it's, it's a...1f you think about it now, today, as a father or a grandfather, it was absolutely inhuman to, to, to separate the child from the parents, and I think we, we could do it because we were not parents ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We...although we were very upset about it and we found it very difficult, we didn't quite realize how, how, how terrible 1t was, in my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  What happened to brothers and sisters or, I should say, siblings? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Were they usually kept together, or were they placed with different families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  It depended. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I mean sometimes if, if 1t would be possible to put two boys, or let's say, brother and sister or two sisters at the same address, but most of the addresses didn't want to have two. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was too risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So...and we didn't make a principle out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Just if it happened and we could find, uh, an address where they wanted two, uh, uh, two children, then, then, then of course we, we gave them a sister or two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But it didn't happen many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Because...it...one child was danger; two children were even more dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  What was the climate like at this time amongst the community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Very bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I, I think that the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> more than the rest of the population of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> realized how, how bad it was and how inhuman the Dutch people--the German people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I think they realized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I, I can tell you a story which always sticks to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Just in, in, in, in'42 when the first razzias were, uh, happening, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> to look for addresses for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And, now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> 1s about a hundred and fifty kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And people didn't want to believe my story about razzias. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They really didn't want to... didn't succeed at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It, it's, it's...and it's a hundred and fifty kilometers from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And only after half a year they accepted it, and ...they knew that it was true, but it took at least half the year for a hundred and fifty kilometer further... people realized what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Why do you think that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  I think that's, that's the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">People don't believe even things which are very near to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  What was happening to your family during this entire time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  My father died in '40 so I had no father anymore and my mother lived alone and she hided, uh, adults...adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">She had many adults in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but she was never caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Never?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">She survived the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  Were you aware that she was hiding Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She got...she got some of the, of the adults from me, so I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And she was willing to take the risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  And your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  I had no brother--my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  Sister.</span></p>
