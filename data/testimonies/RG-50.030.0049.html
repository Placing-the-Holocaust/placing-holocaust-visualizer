class="sentence" id="147">But I feel that I have to tell this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">In the beginning on the war, when in Ia _1 the Jews start to be killed by the Romani...the same people. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We arrived in the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was something unbelievable huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I want to tell you that this camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span> was built by the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian, a part of the Polish Army was evacuated in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So this...this

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miercurea-Ciuc</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But this was the biggest of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And, uh, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a very interesting mixture of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It...1t was divided in four and seven classes...uh, seven departments. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And this department one or two, it was ...1t was some opposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, uh, diplomats, which they paid to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And the third class, 1t was a Legionary--the fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I'll tell you that, entering in this...in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I said to myself, "Hey. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">No...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me dirty names, and so on." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Walking in front of this, uh, [third] department of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , which we didn't know who they are--these people, they start to yell to us and curs...cursing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I said, "Here, too?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Where there are the Legionnaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And department four, there were womans. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The department five, it was the evacuees. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We stood [NB: stayed] in the evacuees department. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was the department number six, it was the suspects of communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And number seven, these were the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There are separate <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , but we managed to communicate with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Of course, not with the Legionnaires! </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Uh, after a short period of time, uh, part of us they sent to work in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> ...in the <span class="DLF">gardening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And another part, there are sent the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...it was, uh, Valea or Valea Jiului, which was, where it was a famous lieutenant commander-- Trepadu_--which was the criminal, and after the war he was judged as a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in...1n the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span> with a period of time, uh, four months, almost four months, when we are sent back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hu_ 1</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we are put in, uh, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local camp</span> , into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We are obliged to wear the yellow badge. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we are from time to time allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and to change our underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Talking about this, I want to repeat another story about this, what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">When I received my first, uh, "approval," how to say, to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to change my, my, uh, underwear, it was in Hu 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Uh, I remember that it was way to go to...to my hou... my parents' <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I know [one is] quite, uh...not a very, uh...not a center of the <span class="DLF">street</span> ; but I said, "No, I have to

see people, and people to see me; because everybody knows me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I remember that walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I saw a girl which it was a very good friend of my young years. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And she saw me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But she saw...seeing me coming with the yellow badge, she crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She didn't want to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I walked farther. </span><span

class="sentence" id="391">And I think I wrote about this in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Imagine, I went in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> --completely empty. </span><span
