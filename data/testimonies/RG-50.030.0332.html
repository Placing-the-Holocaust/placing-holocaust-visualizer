<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>

They used to tell us to come on the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They took out x amount of Jews and they took them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So, therefore people were afraid to do anything or say anything and this is how it went day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And then they started to ask all the Jews who's got copper, gold, silver, whatever they should bring it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">If they knew that you have it and didn't bring it, they put you against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That's all there is to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In front of everybody.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  I couldn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We had to wear the lattis(ph), you know, the yellow and you couldn't walk after 7 o'clock on the <span class="DLF">street</span> unless you have a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Then it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Every few months, they used to ask for something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We also had a Judenrat, that means some of the Jews, they were the responsible people for all the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and whatever they asked the Judenrat came to the Jews and said, "Look, we have to do that or else." </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So that's what the Judenrat was for. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But, was there maybe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also you had to have a permit to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They send you to work, otherwise you couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">What else can I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We didn't have it too good, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">One morning they told us to get out again, and the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and they took out 120, 140 Jews and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Mostly was they were like teachers, nurses, more educated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They had at least they know who to take out and that was the end of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And also in'41, the end of '41 they made a shreta (ph), you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They took everybody out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they are to go to the old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We had an old and a, a young one, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But the old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And they put us one by one and they took out the disabled, either kids or grownups. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Some of them are half crazy or whatever it is and they just killed them, and then they brought in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> and they took about a thousand of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They dug a <span class="DLF">pit</span> , a big one, and from one end of the <span class="DLF">pit</span> to the other, a wooden board. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">A big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They used to put you up there in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Give you a shot and you fell in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Do you know what I'm talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So, a thousand Jews they killed in that one.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages, not with food, but she used to give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it is and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Do you know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Therefore, in case there's a shooting and we have to run or split, you know, at least for that they'll give you a piece of bread, some butter, or some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Something. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">You'll have something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And everytime there was an the alarm, you used to take this little package and I started running and it was like a false alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">You know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The day that was really important because that was the day that no Jews allowed to be living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so they're going to make Judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So how can you live there? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So of course that morning I didn't take nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">What I had on me, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So, my brother, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Northbrook</span> , 1n <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , he was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My mother, father and youngest brother were running one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Me and this brother were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I don't know where we were running but we were running and two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from us was my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That's my uncle that's the uncle that makes my shoes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So, my mother went the other way and then she remember half way running to the <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> , she forgot, she better go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and get a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">She just baked fresh bread in case you have to sit a day or two so you have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">By the time she got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, my father and my little brother, the youngest one, they were hiding in an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> somewhere with another few couples and after two nights I think, they ran away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">As soon as you walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  You were saying your brothers ran out, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  And a lot of people are from farmers, from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , you know, where they got married in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to somebody or vice a versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So in other words, they knew the vicinity very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So, my father, my brother and this guy and a few more, they went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I was sitting with my brother knowing what my uncle did last time when they were killing us that he spared his wife and kids and everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So I don't know, something told me I should go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I went there with my brother and they also had a <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> , you know, down and we were hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The first day was very quiet except they came in -- the Germans used to come in with a ball,a round ball, you understand, and we didn't have carpet so they used to take the ball and roll 1t over the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">You see, if you dug something underneath it would settle, do you know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, the ball would have to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So it means that underneath there is somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Do you understand what I'm saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Sort of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  On a straight <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> when you throw a ball, okay, it runs until it stops by itself, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But here is not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">You see if they dug underneath the dirt settled let the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So, it makes just like a dent, it's lower, the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So they put the ball and it stops in the middle of <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span> they figure they better check, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Anyway, things got..., everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Then my aunt she was the aunt, my mother's sister, her kids, four of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They had two boys and two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We were all sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">My uncle's sister, with the children, maybe ten people, or whatever, and my uncle comes back because the zungenfuhrer (ph) asks him, "Where is your wife and kids?" </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He says, "I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I better go looking." </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he told them he's going to try to spare them too this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they told me, he come to us at night and took his wife out and the kids and he says that the zungenfuhrer (ph) said he's going to let you live and he told us there's going to be Judenrein, no Jews, you better go away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Go somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So anyway the following day we heard that my aunt and the kids got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They killed them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They only let live my uncle and the son.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  How did you hear these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">You said, "we heard this." </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You said the following day "we heard that my aunt was killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">How did you get this information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My uncle came back the following night and said they killed everybody except his son and he said we should better get out and that there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that they had still our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So, this 1s what we did the night he came telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We ran away, I mean I ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We walked all night and during the day we went somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I don't even know, on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , in an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> where they had the pigs and the cows whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We saw the Germans from far but you know your heart is in your mouth and you hope you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So, of course after the night, after the day got dark a little bit and we went walking to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So, we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Sonia?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dworitz</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  One other question. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">When you left your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was it easy to get out that night? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Were there guards or were you just able to walk out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  You could walk out, yes, because between shooting and killing so many people there was no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So, they used to put x amount of people, I don't know the amount, we had a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> and they stuffed them into the <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> and from there they used to take them to the <span class="DLF">graves</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  So, you got out, you slept in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or something that night and the next day you continued to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  The evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You couldn't walk during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Let's say if it was in the summer time, which it was, or in the winter time when the days are longer or shorter so by evening most of us knew how to go to these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> because they were not, maybe they were ten miles all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So, leaving there was no problem to go into a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and know how to get in there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, this is what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We came there in the morning and all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">My brother was also the same place in the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> but he was also making shoes so they let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I mean not they let him out, they took all the people, all the workers, what they need, and they send them over to another working.... It's like, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the rest whoever did not make it they cut out with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Some of them stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> for four or five days because they had enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And then the Germans sooner or later the Germans got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, the people that ran away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> which most of them are alive, and those that didn't, that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dworitz</span> (ph), I found my cousin there that he came also from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My brother was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> about 30 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And my younger brother, he was there too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So, I don't know how long it was, they went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I haven't seen him yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I just had my younger brother with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">My father survived with the little brother and they came also in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, one of the guys heard that his sons are alive also in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was and he was also from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm town</span> so he knew exactly how to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So, he came and took maybe ten of us, so he took me, and my brother, he took his kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They were there too, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dworitz</span> , that I'm calling that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Then I came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> I found my father, my three brothers and one I had with me, is four, you know, and what can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was another time of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Let me just stop you. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> were near by and this was early summer of '42?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, they caught my youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">He was eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And what they didn't do to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And then they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You know, they cut you up and they mutilate you and then they kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So, we ran away, we ran away from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">In other words, we could move around in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> but you still have to-- if there is a big <span class="DLF">highway</span> , it's a no no because you don't know who's driving and who's going by, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So, we learned how to go this way or that way and we didn't have a compass or nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Compass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  When they killed your brother, did they make you watch it or did you just hear about it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  How many, I'm just trying to get a sense of how many people were in your group at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  There was no such a thing as groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">The partisans they were organized just like my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">The younger one -- both of them did but the younger one did by himself, he went back to the walking log(?), </span><span class="sentence" id="482">what's another name, and he and another boy they dug under the barbed wire and he already knew because he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He ran away from there and he dug it and he came 1n and he talked to an uncle of ours, they wanted winter boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He was there with his son, you know, and he took up maybe 25 guys and he came back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with them and went another time and took out my uncle, this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">The first time he took the son, and the second time he took the uncle and more people and they came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So, you see the people that were the partisans, they organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We had nothing to do with them and they had nothing to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So in other words if you take here families, ten families, one was living in this <span class="NPIP">corner</span> somewhere, the other one was living somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">You didn't pay rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">You can move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Nobody told you not to move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">You know, so we managed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  How many were with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Well, in the beginning maybe three families, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">When I say families it could be two people out of the family, because the other ones they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">You know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It depends who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Sometimes let's say you hear about, oh your sister is..., somebody told me that your sister is in this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They would pick themselves up, they had nothing anyway, and they would go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  So, from time to time maybe another family would join you or someone would leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  Yes, that's right, but we had nothing to do with the partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Now, how did you get whatever you needed like food or supplies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We used to go at night to the farmers to beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">My brother went, I went all of us went wherever we wanted to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So, we used to go in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and some of them used to give us something and this is how we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Of course in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> we had cranberries, blueberries, boysenberries, you know that grows in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , so we used to go-- mushrooms--we used to go and pick them and we had something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Bread we used to get sometimes from the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">What can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We didn't have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , we didn't have nothing only the fire, you know, to make a fire that's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Water, we used to dig a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> and dig deep enough until the water comes up. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">When it came up we used to take it out and take a handkerchief and push it through, you know what I'm talking, the dirt because otherwise you're going to drink dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">This is how we had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We didn't starve to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Nobody starved in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , but we didn't have enough to eat, but we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We used to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> there, the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and see potatoes so we used to take them out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Sometimes we used to bake them by the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Sometimes we ate them raw, potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We didn't have salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So we didn't, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But we did survive, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  How did you know which farmers to trust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  We didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The only thing 1s if the farmers knew if they're going to give out a Jew to the Germans, especially on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , the next day the partisan will be there and going to put them, let them in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , let them stay, take all the cattle and burn up the cows with them together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  But you weren't working with the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  The only -- my connection with the partisans is because my two brothers were fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My father had two brothers they were there fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My other uncle his son -- like I said it was a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so there was somebody that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, you know what I'm talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So when I used to go sometimes if they stayed close to us sometimes, you know, but if it's far we didn't, we couldn't go, so they used to give us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But the majority we had to go ourselves at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Were you ever, well, you found out sometimes where the people you knew in the partisans were sort of a word of mouth tn the <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Sometimes we knew, not all the time and we wouldn't go risking our lives to go where they're at. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Let's say if it's within a few miles we'll go to see them, but anything further or maybe I don't know we wouldn't go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  But you might come across other people who would say to you I ran into your cousin?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  How did you keep in touch at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I mean how did you find each other occasionally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Well, like I said it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whoever came settled down in here the other went somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So we used to go from one to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , depends. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We didn't like to sit in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> because in case somebody spot us, so we always kept on moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But what I'm saying 1s not necessarily did we stay around the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The partisans were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So this is then in 1943, January or February my younger brother got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The white Pollocks killed him; him and another boy, and they brought the boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He was strictly with <span class="DLF">mines</span> and <span class="DLF">railroading</span> and <span class="DLF">mines</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He had 21, 21 times he mined <span class="DLF">railroads</span> or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And my other brother lived through the war, the oldest one, and when the Russians came in they took most of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Some ran away, and some did not have to go because if the Russian what, major or whatever he was did not want to take the partisans because they were not fighters, you know what I'm talking, not army people. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So, if he was different he said, "No, I won't let you go boys." </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The Russian army wants him but you're not trained for war. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">This is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">My brother went, stepped on a <span class="DLF">mine</span> and he got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I was left with one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And what can I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We did have a doctor there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">What are you going to pray? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">They killed everybody already and you don't know if even in ten minutes you're going to be dead so what are you going to pray, for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">No, we didn't pray, we didn't go anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  Did you feel there was any difference between being a girl in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and a boy or a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Did you feel more vulnerable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Not especially no. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">You see, most of the girls were looking for boyfriends or the boyfriends looking for girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I didn't have to look because I had my father and my brother with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So, the three of us and we had another family, I wasn't looking for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">But some, yes, it's like Harold said. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You can make a novel out of what went on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">There's no question about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  I'm just trying to get a sense because we really don't hear much about the differences between men and women but I suspect that there were, that women might have had a different experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  There were girls that were fighting just like the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And there were girls that stayed; they had parents, like I had a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">They stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">But some of them had boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">My husband 1s alive because he didn't accept an offer from another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I betcha he can hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">She hid, she--every boy she hid got killed or died, whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">See, she wanted him to get married there and stay married and he said nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">First I have to live through the war and then we'll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">She didn't want it so she picked up another few boyfriends, you know, and they all got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I said to Harold it's a good thing you ran away from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">No joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Somebody is unlucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  So what you're saying is that the girls in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> wanted some sort of protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  And they mostly went to the Gentile soldiers, or partisans, they were more safer with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Because let's say if you are a pretty girl and you have a Jewish boyfriend, nght, and there comes a, we used to call them Bostochnik (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="772">That's the Russian, from west, you know, all the way from the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So, if they had their eyes on somebody let's say it wouldn't do anybody any good, any Jewish boy to go with that girl because he's going to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">He can take a boy and kill him for that too, just to be able to go with that girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So, there was, yes, yes, a lot of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  What about when we talk about the partisans you made the point that you were really very separate but you'd run into them from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  You also said that sometimes you might make bread for them or they might bring you things. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Was there any--
ANSWER:  I didn't make bread for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I told you about a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">When we came in they had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baker's oven</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  Oh, it was a partisan <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So and we, the first year we were close, too, so I used to come like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I used to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and there were the girls with this one I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and with this one was a neighbor of mine, whatever it is, you know, and they would give me food. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">This is what I was saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  So there was really no mutual help between your family and partisan groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">ANSWER:  No, they were entirely separate from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  Were you ever in a situation where somebody whether it was the local people or partisans or Soviet partisans who came and took the few things you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he had boots on and he wanted the boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Yes, they would do things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">That's why I said we had to hide from everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  You never were really safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  Did you have many close calls?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  Yes, one time they were chasing me and the bullet went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> instead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  Who is "they?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Meaning Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  They were nearby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">See, we were inexperienced how to live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">To us, it was new. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Well, how do you know how to, what to do and when to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So in the beginning, yes they would. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But later on they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Oh, yes, we had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  No, the same thing, the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because they made every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">We didn't know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that they are alive or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Sometimes the farmers used to come from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know, what's going on but other than that they didn't have radios.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the only Jews alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  I'll tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">When we saw the Red Army, this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Now we are alive, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course this gave us a big boost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">QUESTION:  But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland--
ANSWER:  Yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you depressed? </span><span class="sentence" id="823">It's a strange feeling isn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  Nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You know why? </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Because we took it each day as it comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We did not know what tomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to take for them to kill us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">No hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any difference to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Well, to me, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">You know what I'm talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They used to turn down from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> sort of, you know, and fly away. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">They never came to <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">They did not land.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  But you would find out about this through the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">You see they, I'll tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Because they had a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there's no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It has to be a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans knew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication, whatever it is and they went back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">But at least we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> knows that we're here. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="847">SO, it gave us a different feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But eh...
QUESTION:  I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans? </span><span class="sentence" id="849">How did you know this was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">ANSWER:  Because it happened in this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vivorg</span> (ph) exactly then, you know, and what can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They had to have a <span class="DLF">field</span> where to drop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">You should see how the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was lighting up. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">You can, you wanted to dance and sing, but you couldn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">But this, this 1s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">QUESTION:  So you saw it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  Oh, yes with my own eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Yup, that I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  Okay, that's what I was trying to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">What do you think was the hardest thing about living in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  The hardest thing is survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">This is an answer, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Survival was the hardest thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  What was the most difficult thing to do in order to survive?</span></p>
