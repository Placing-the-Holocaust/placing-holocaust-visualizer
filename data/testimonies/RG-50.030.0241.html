<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good Afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you please tell me, for the record, your name, your date of birth and your place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well my name was Gerd G-E-R-D Sigmund(ph) von Halle. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Was born on December 2, 1922, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I had one brother and his name was Hans Jurgen(ph), and he was | year and nine months older than I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And what was your father's occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My father's occupation — he was an architect, specializing in building department stores in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Would you tell me a little bit about your childhood while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Well, it was a very pleasant time. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was doing rather well as an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We lived in a upper middle class neighborhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> there, and life was, was pretty nice although I understand when I was a baby, of course — this was still — we're talking about 1922, ‘23, there was, they had it was at the end of World War I and the inflation I understand from my mother that they bought a bottle of milk for a million marks and so on, so times were not that easy when I was a baby, but I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And we went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , went to what they call <span class="BUILDING">Oberrealschule</span> !, </span><span class="sentence" id="14">which you would call here a <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then Hitler well, of course, in 1930 and ‘31 and ‘32, Hitler became more popular and things became more difficult for the Jews although I was still a young child and not quite aware of everything that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In 1933, Hitler came to power as Chancellor and then, of course, things changed very dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I still remember being in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> as an 11 year old and we had to learn how to give the Hitler salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So here we were marching around in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> giving the Hitler salute in the proper fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And whenever there was a holiday every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had to display a flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was either the swastika flag or the German flag and we didn't display either one of them, but then we were told that we had to and so my father went out and he bought the German flag black, red and gold flag, and so we displayed that on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and my father was very much aware that there was no future for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So since he had a sister married to a Dutchman in ' <span class="BUILDING">Technical high school</span> (German) Amsterdam, he decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Furthermore, although we had been thinking in terms of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1933 wasn't exactly <span class="DLF">streets</span> weren't lined with gold and I think <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> didn't need a German architect at that particular time, so we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in those days was an absolutely delightful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I would say probably one of the most wonderful times of my life I've spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was a very quiet, easy going lifestyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The Dutch were delightful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Everything went very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Everything was very neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Everything was very clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so there we, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> even though when we arrived there the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch schools</span> were way ahead of the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> and so I was — and both my brother and I, we were both put back one class so we were put back one grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="31"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , as I said, was, was delightful uneventful to a degree and, and we were not — and of course, the war clouds started gathering in the late ‘30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we were not too much worried about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> being — becoming involved in the war because in the last war, that is, World War I, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And for whatever reason — I can't give you the reason, but for whatever reason, we felt and the Dutch people felt that because we were neutral in World War I we probably will remain neutral in World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Needless to say, that did not turn out to be true and in May of 1940 the German army moved into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the war really was over before it even began because the whole Dutch army had to capitulate within a period of four or five days that we were no match for the German army who came in with a tremendous amount of air power etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Being a Jew, of course, that was a very, very unsettling time for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We saw the German army marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">For the first time in my life, I see the green uniforms which was the uniform of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I'd never seen that before, and they marched through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and to be very honest, we were quite frightened by all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">As it turned out, the first year of the occupation was completely uneventful. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The Germans in that first year of occupation behaved almost unbelievably gentleman-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They didn't bother anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There were no real problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Until one day, a group of young Jews were arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> just haphazardly. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They were just taken off the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">There was no reason for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And they were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And then followed by about a month or so later, there was — I don't know whether it's exactly the way it happened, but there was an explosion in a German officer's club. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Now whether it was an explosion or somebody let the soup boil over or whatever happened, I don't know what happened, but they decided to arrest 225 young German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Not Dutch Jews, German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so one night I was coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> around four o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My brother was working, learning the metals trade, and my brother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about I would say around five-thirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> were outside on the <span class="DLF">window</span> , so people knew that we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And the door bell rang, and I never gave it a second thought and I walked up to the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and two men in brown leather coats pushed their way past me, went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and came out with a list and they asked me whether anybody by the name of Hans Jurgen(ph) von Halle lived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Well, my brother was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> and truthfully, I didn't know what to say, and before I could say anything my brother came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> and he wanted to know what was going on and they turned to him and said, "What's your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he said, "My name is Hans Jiirgen(ph) von Halle." </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And then they said, "Is there a Gerd Carl von Halle here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They said, "What's your name." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I said, "My name is Gerd Sigmund von Halle." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They said, "Well, that must be the same one." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So they put us under arrest and they pushed us out the <span class="DLF">front door</span> just the way we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We did not have time to say goodbye to our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And they marched us from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Now when I say they marched us, we were not handcuffed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We were just — my brother and I were just walking there individually, and these two Gestapo agents 1n their leather coats just followed behind about — I don't know — 20 feet behind, and all they did 1s tell us turn right, turn left, straight ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And so that if you had passed us by on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you would never in a million years would you have known that these two young boys were under arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And we arrived at <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , oh, I would say around five-thirty, six o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we were one of the last to arrive, and when I looked around I saw practically all of my friends were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There were 226 young German Jews all lined up in that <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> which was a former <span class="BUILDING">girls school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we were lined up down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and we were shouted at and yelled at and, you know, we had to stand at attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we stood at attention from six o'clock until about midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And we weren't allowed to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We weren't allowed to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And around midnight the commandant of the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> stepped forward and said, "Is there anybody here who has a serious and I mean serious illness to report?" </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And he explained that anybody who would be fooling him, he explained what the drastic consequences of that would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My brother, who was standing next to me, pushed me sort of with his elbow and said, "Step forward." </span><span class="sentence" id="80">and I whispered back to him, I said, "What can I, what can I talk about ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It so turned out as a child I was, I was not one of the strongest kids on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I suffered a great deal from bronchitis which 5,000,000 other people suffer from, and my brother said to me, "Tell him you have TB" I never had TB in my life, thank goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I was very, very, very reluctant to step forward because I was afraid of the consequences because they told me what the consequences would be if you lied. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But he sort of insisted on it, and since he was my older brother by a year and almost two years, I stepped forward and I had to go into he took me into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he says, "What's the matter with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And that's all he wanted to know and I — he — I had to step back in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">As it turned out, there was — I said to you there was 220 — there was 226 young German Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And the order was to arrest these * tuberculosis Jews between the ages of 16 and 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Now, this — there was one kid in this group of 226 who happened to be 15, and in typical German fashion when the order said 16 to 21, you only take people 16 to 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This kid was 15 and, therefore, around midnight or thereabout, he was dismissed. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The kid happened to be not a friend of mine, but he knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he went directly from <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> to my parents' <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , told my parents what he saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My parents could only put two and two together and surmised that probably what I told them that I suffer from TB They in turn went to my family physician, a Jewish Dutchman doctor by the name of Dr. Hertzberger. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Dr. Hertzberger, when my parents told him what had happened wrote out a certificate which I gave to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , which states that I am suffering from TB Now, so we're here now back in the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and around midnight or | o'clock in the morning we were transported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schoorl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That's spelled S-C-H-O-O-R-L, which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alkmaar</span> in <span class="REGION">North Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">This was a camp surrounded and protected by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we stayed there for approximately, oh, I would say, somewhere in the neighborhood of six to eight weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Our treatment now certainly wasn't good but it wasn't brutal to the degree that you know, we learned later on what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We were subjected to all the harassment and so on, but nobody was killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">One day I was called into the <span class="BUILDING">commandant's office</span> , and as I went into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I snapped at attention and in front of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I looked down on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I saw a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I could see it even though it was upside down. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I could see it was a letter of Dr. Hertzberger. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the commandant says to me, "What's wrong with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And this man seemed to be the kind of individual that certainly did not want to be in the presence of anybody who had a contagious disease and he said to me, "Get out of here and get and get out of the camp immediately." </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So I ran back to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I said goodbye to my brother who was with me there, and I was released that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And now there were 224 boys left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">These 224 boys that same day were sent from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local concentration camp</span> to probably one of the most infamous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of all called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I arrived, I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I hitchhiked my way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> from there, and I was very, very busy going around seeing all of the parents of my friends who had been there and telling everybody that everybody was doing well under the circumstances etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We received a card from my brother from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> which is — now remember, we're talking about the year 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That was in the early part of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We received a letter, a post card from him, which was a sort of a printed post card. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It just said, "I,” then he filled in his name, “Hans Jurgen von Halle, born May 7th, 1921, am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Mauthausen</span> as of such and such a date as prisoner number so and so in <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> number so and so, etcetera.” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Now it was very unusual to receive a letter like this, but the reason why we received it because as I said before, it was still 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We also received two letters from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The letters I also gave to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We were not a sentimental family. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Somehow we were brought up in the — I don't know how to put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In the — well we were not brought up sentimentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And when we saw the letter with my brother which started off — he wrote in German because they had to pass the, the what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The censor. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He wrote in German, “Liebe, liebe, Eltern,*” “Dear, dear parents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Now that is not the way my brother would speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He does not say, "Dear, dear parent." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That is not his language. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And that was not my language. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And then he goes through the letter and in the letter you can see — when you read the letter, you can see the absolutely desperation that these boys were in, that he was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We received two letters and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Shortly after the last letter arrived, I got a — I don't remember whether it was a call or a notice from the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> that somebody from the family had to report to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And my parents wanted to go and I didn't allow them to go and I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And what happened is they showed us a list of all 224 boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Everyone of them had died of “pneumonia” quote unquote. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Needless to say, from what I understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was one of the most cruel <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They didn't have a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They didn't have to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">This was a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , and from what I understand these boys were just lined up at the top of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and just pushed down into the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> which was — whatever it was, a hundred feet lower below and just pushed to their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Very efficient way of killing people without bullets, without gas, without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Well, I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this was probably one of the most difficult things for me to tell my parents that their — let's see, my brother was maybe 21 or 20, he was 20 — that their 20 year old son, six foot tall, broad shoulders, never been sick in his life, had died of pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My, my mother who was the strong party in the family stood up very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My father absolutely disintegrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He absolutely disintegrated about the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Couldn't hack it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And my mother really sort of was the, as you might say, the Starke*. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And so that was the first chapter in the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We then — 1941 — we then continued things — after that, things moved quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We were of course Jews were not allowed to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Jews were not allowed to have radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You had to turn them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Jews weren't allowed to have silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You had to turn them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Then came the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Everybody had to wear the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I'll tell you quite frankly, wearing a yellow star, even though I was certainly very proud to be a Jew, but going out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> with a star about the size this big with the word Jew or in Dutch Jood?, </span><span class="sentence" id="156">J- O-O-D, printed on it is a very, very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Very strange indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It's not the kind of a thing that, if you've never experienced it, it's like going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> today and saying I have, you know, I'm a prisoner or going out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with a prison uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It's almost the same comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">More arrests and more arrests and more arrests and before you knew it, these friends were taken prisoners and these friends were taken prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">In the meantime, in order to be able to escape from deportation, I took a job learning the > Dear, dear Parents (German) * Strong (German) > Jew (Dutch) shoemaker's trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You were becoming a shoemaker to the Jewish population and for a limited period of time that exempted you from being deported, so I became a shoemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And realizing, of course, that this was strictly a limited kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">This was not going to be anything of longstanding and I one day, I said to my parents, "This can't go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There are too many people have been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Our turn, if it's not today, 1t will be tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">If it's not tomorrow, it will be next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We have to get out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And so we decided one day, actually from one day to the next we decided to leave our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And I want you to know that we just left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> just the way it was, with the pictures on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and the food in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> and the clothes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and, and, and nothing was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The only thing we did is we gave the key to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to one of our neighbors who we knew and trusted and these were two ladies which I will come back to later on in my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And they had a key to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But we just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I only attended <span class="BUILDING">college</span> for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And one of the college professors. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">His name was Mr. In't Hout, I-N-apostrophe-T H-O-U-T. In't Hout, that was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I called him and I told him what our situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And without blinking an eye, without hesitating for one minute, he says, "Come right over." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And so we walked out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we went to Mr. In't Hout's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it was just a small — was a family of four, a husband and wife and two children, a boy and girl about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There were only two — it was, it was a three- bedroom apartment and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was occupied by the parents and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was occupied by the girl and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was occupied by the boy, and what they did is they put the boy and the girl together in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and gave me the third <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and their brother-in-law took my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Now the problem was, now that we are no longer officially in <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> in our regular <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we now no longer have access to rationing cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Rationing cards is the lifeline to food. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And these two ladies who were living above us, they belonged to the Dutch underground, and they supplied us with rationing cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And so we stayed in that my parents at the in-laws, in the brother-in-law's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I in Mr. In't Hout's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We stayed for a couple of months ‘til they found a quote permanent residence for us, which was on a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> maybe couple of hundred people in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alrijksdaal(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="188">A small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not known for anything except they make church bells. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alrijkksdaal(ph</span> ), and we went to this <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and it was a great relief because whereas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> we had to stay within this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> at night at least, I could go out into the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and so on and walk around in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And everything was pretty pleasant there ‘til one day a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn(ph) arrived also, another Jewish couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And Mr. Kahn(ph) was a very nice little gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You might call him in English, in the American slang, you might call him, he was a milky toast. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">A nothing individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Very nice, lovely person. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">His wife, the exact opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">His wife was a beautiful lady, a tremendous flirt, and before you turned around, she took up an affair with the farmer who had a wife who had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And I guess the farmer's wife was not quite happy about the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And in desperation when to the authorities and told them that there were Jews in there — in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Unbeknown to us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And so one night we were sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> , which was downstairs, facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> and as I'm looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I all of a sudden see a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German army car</span> pulling up with four German Gestapo agents jumping out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and running into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Well, as we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> arriving, we, everybody went different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My father went up into the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Mrs. Kahn(ph) went out the <span class="DLF">back door</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Mr. Kahn(ph) went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , in his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">My mother went into our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and hid in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , and I went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> there was a little <span class="DLF">ledge</span> and I sort of crouched behind the <span class="DLF">ledge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And before I even could turn around I could hear the Gestapo agent arresting my father because I could hear him talking to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And Mr. Kahn(ph) was arrested immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And the farmer was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So what they did is they took all of the suitcases from Mrs. Kahn(ph), Mr. and Mrs. Kahn(ph) and they put them into our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And our suitcases were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And they put the suitcases all in front of my mother's <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> where she was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And every <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was opened up except that one <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Because they themselves barricaded that one <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and so that was the reason why they didn't get in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They left with the prisoners, with my father, Mr. Kahn(ph) and the and the farmer, and they sealed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They sealed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in which my mother was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The put a wax seal on it and they said they would be back two hours later to get, to get the goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And as soon as they left, I got out of my <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , out of my little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I spoke to my mother over the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And I'll tell you quite frankly in all my life I have never made a more difficult decision than I did at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">My mother came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and we are now discussing what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We couldn't get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">If there were 200 families — if there were 200 people in the, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I think all 200 hundred were standing around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So there was no way to get her out through the <span class="DLF">window</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Beside the <span class="DLF">window</span> was up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So the question was really should you stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or should you go under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">That was the only two alternatives in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And I decided, based on nothing, based on gut feeling if you want to call it, that I wanted her to go under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So she went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I went back into my little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And sure enough, couple of hours later they came back and they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they emptied out every <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , every suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They took the suitcase, put it on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Actually only two men came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Originally they were four. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Now, they only had two men came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">One was standing on one side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The other guy was standing on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And they emptied out the suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I remember like it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I had the first electric razor that ever was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Not that I was the first one, but it was one of the first razors ever made by Phillips. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And all of a sudden I hear my razor going. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And well these guys had never seen an electric razor. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And so, “That was good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I'll take the razor." </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And then they pulled out a suit, and "Well, that suit fits my brother-in-law." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And "That dress, that's good for my girlfriend." "</span><span class="sentence" id="246">And that thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The entire thing was divided up between these two characters while my mother was under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I would say they must have spent a minimum of an hour and a half in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> dividing up the loot. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">If you analyze it, you think about it, here is a woman under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">If she had as much as coughed, sneezed or anything! </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The difference between — what we sometimes forget is the difference between being caught and not being caught 1s the difference between being alive or dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That's the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There is no, there is no — you know, if you can always, say, "Well, I got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You know, I stole, I stole an apple and the cop on the corner caught me and he put me in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a week and then I got out again." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">This was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Here if you got caught, that's the end of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It's a death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So my mother was — and I might say one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">While my father — when my father was arrested and he — you know, he was up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> he came down in the they put him into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> where my mother was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in the beginning and he — they must have left him alone for maybe 30 seconds or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He took off his ring, his wedding band and threw it into the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and that ring I still have to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">That was his wedding band that he gave to his wife, my mother, and, and that was the only thing that we saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So after they took all the, the loot, they couldn't fit it all into their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They took what they could, sealed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the second time, and said they would come back the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So after they left, here's my mother back in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , sealed and unable to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I decided at that point that she had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Come <span class="NPIP">hell</span> or high water, she had to get out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because she was lucky twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">First in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> where they didn't see her, then under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where they didn't see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This will not last for the third time. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So around midnight after all the people around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everything was quiet, I put a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> up against the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I went up on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and she came out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and put her feet on my shoulder and we sort of — which ever way, we finally made it downstairs and now where do we go from here? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Now the farmer had a very, very tall haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">When I say haystack, one of these huge haystacks with a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we decided that we're going to go up on the haystack and see where we're going from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We didn't know what we're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So we climbed up on the haystack with a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> which it certainly was not too uncomfortable — was a comfortable <span class="NPIP">place</span> to relax ‘til about a couple of hours later we got word from the underground that the Gestapo had found out that there were two more Jews left in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And the Gestapo was on their way back to get both my mother and I. Well, with that message in hand, we had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Where we're going from here? </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Here we are in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We decided — I was told also by the underground that the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alrijksdaal</span> was surrounded by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And so therefore we could not go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So I knew that the next <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> was further south and I didn't know exactly how to get there but I knew in what general direction I had to go, so I took my mother by hand and we walked — I would say we walked somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of probably five to six hours through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and probably more than that, ‘til we finally reached the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and my mother and I both in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> although we did not sit together because if one of us got arrested we didn't want both of us to be arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So I sat there with a newspaper in front of me so that my face would not show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My mother was sitting on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And we took off and the next railroad stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alryksdaal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and sure enough, there they were waiting for us, and we just sort of went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">When I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I got on the phone and I called my teacher, the only person I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Not the only person I knew, but the only person I knew who might be able to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I called him on the phone and I said, "Here we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">This is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My father was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My mother and I are here." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And again without thinking for one second, he says, "Come right over." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So this is 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We are walking clear across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and we wind up back at Mr. In't Hout's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> — <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Here again, this little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> — it's a <span class="INT_SPACE">city apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We were there and we stayed in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My mother and I stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Never left the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Never saw fresh air, it's a strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You know even a prisoner is allowed every day to exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We could not exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and so here we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Then the following year, Mrs. In't Hout died. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Of natural causes, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And which was a difficult time because now there were a hundred people coming to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and nobody was allowed to know that we were in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so we stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and somehow they put some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> in front of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> so that nobody would walk into that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Let me ask you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">What was it like living in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">How did you keep yourself occupied during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We did get the underground newspaper which was called Het Volk°, V-O-L- K. We read that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">These were very religious people. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They were Protestant people and they read a great deal about the New Testament and the Old Testament and truthfully, I learned a great deal about the Old Testament and the New testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I took up sketching. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I got some paper and a pencil and I did some sketching and I still have those sketches. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's very difficult and then, of course, every day we were always aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Every time the <span class="DLF">door</span> bell rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Every time I heard somebody coming up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , not to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> you could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You always worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Who is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Who's coming up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So we decided to — there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and I decided to cut a <span class="DLF">hole</span> into the roof of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I cut a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , oh, what would you call this? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Two feet? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It was about two feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I cut a, cut a <span class="DLF">hole</span> two square feet into the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And got a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Looked in and there I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">However, so here this is this bare <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then I saw at the end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , a <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And what I did, I took a hammer and a screwdriver and slowly I took out brick by brick by brick, I took out a small section of that <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Just a triangle, just big enough and every time I took out the brick, I marked the brick with a number one, two, three, four, five, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And so what happened is when I took out he brick you got into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and there in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , when I was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , I took the bricks and put them back, one, two, three, four, five, and so it almost became a solid <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And whenever there was any kind of a problem, my mother and I would go up into this two by two <span class="DLF">hole</span> , crawl into the — crawl into that <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , into the annex and then put the bricks back in again, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">What else did we do during?
