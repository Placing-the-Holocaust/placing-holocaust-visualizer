<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  That’s north -- north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I understand now that that was abarbel Jewish community at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And then my next rec -- my only recollection -- I don’t have recollection of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tepledseshanof</span> , I do have recollection of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , as where we spent our time before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  This interview will focus on your life experience after liberation, through the present day. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">However, would you tell us, just very briefly, a little bit about your family before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My memories are very, very hazy about family before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I just have little vignettes of happenings, that happened with my sister -- us playing on the <span class="DLF">porch</span> , a storm, a <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , me falling on a <span class="DLF">staircase</span> and hurting my chin, requiring some kind of very burning ointment to -- to heal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I honestly don’t remember my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I remember our surrounding, somewhat -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , or -- I do not remember my mother, my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  But how large was your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So you had a twin sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  [ha -- I had a twin sister and there was my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">All this 1s now confirmed by the pictures that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were very, very lucky to be able to obtain pictures of the four of us, of the three of us, of the two of us, in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  What happened then, when you were forced to -- away from your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Where -- where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  First time away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That was with my mother only, my father had been taken away from us months or maybe a year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Time, to me didn’t really register too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , my mother, my sister and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That’s my first memory of being away from -- from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And do you know now when that was, roughly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  I now know, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was at the beginning of *43 or the end of *42. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That’s roughly the time frame. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And we were there almost a year, before they took us from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> you were together with your mother and your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Yes, we were together as a family, we lived as a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Did you go through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> experience also together with both of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Well, what I know now, is that we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was the winter of ‘43, December ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We did live together for a couple of months until that Czech lager was disbanded and must have been exterminated, except for the exception of some twins and some people that they needed for either work or experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So, up to that point we lived together, after that we were separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My mother was gone at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My sister and I were separated because we lived according to our sexes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the -- the days or the time leading up to liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">What -- in what kind of <span class="NPIP">state</span> were you, in ph-physical, mental state. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Can -- do you have any recollections?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I can’t really tell you what I looked like or what I real -- I felt like -- it felt the same to me all the time, but externally I could tell that there was an activity in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that wasn’t there always before. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The soldiers were much more lax, there were more numerous air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was arterler -- artillery fire that you could hear in -- 1n the -- on the horizons and they we -- it was not as orderly as it was just bef -- during -- it wasn’t as orderly as it was before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Do you remember any -- any particular sounds, or any particular intense images from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Sounds -- just a drone of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and artillery, but nothing else, sound-wise, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  And when liberation came, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">What happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well, liberation to me specifically came while we were on the march and we were being marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , destination who knows and people were having a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was -- it was winter, snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and anybody that fall out of <span class="DLF">line</span> or couldn’t keep it up, they ju -- they would just kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They were shot or pushed overboard and that was the end of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That kept up for a very long time, I can’t tell you exactly how much, but it was on for a very, very long time and all of a sudden the -- our German guards disappeared, they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we were surrounded by Russian soldiers dressed in white and that was -- that was the liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Do you remember what happened then, how they treated you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Well, the Russians -- the memory that I have, they marched us off into a -- into a <span class="BUILDING">food warehouse</span> and there was a general stampede for -- for everything that you could get your hands on and I being very little, I couldn’t really get through to anything, except I do remember very distinctly, being able to grab a hold of a gold can of something and -- and rolling it in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It turned out to be sauerkraut when we opened it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Did you eat it, did you taste it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I must -- the smell of 1t I remember, but I don’t remember really tasting it, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Do you remember how people responded to -- to this food intake all of a sudden, after SO --
ANSWER:  It -- it was frenzied. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">That’s the only way I can describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I don’t have any real visuals about people fainting from or dying, but it was a frenzy of -- of getting at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  How old were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  I had just turned seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was -- my birthday was in December and we were liberated in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  What happened then? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">What is your next memory? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Where were you taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Next memory is -- is a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> setting in -- in -- and I know now it was -- it was pra -- it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I do remember being under doctor’s care and having x-ray work done. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Roentgen, I think, was the name that they used a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I understand that I -- I was a bit sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">From there, my real clear memory is in -- I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  How was it -- do you remember what it was like being there, in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  I -- again, I just remember events that happened to me -- not so much my feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I felt -- no, I-I really should say, I -- I was -- I felt loved, taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">These were nuns that took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And we felt -- we felt that we were being taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I remember at on point in time, one of the nuns gave me a very big hug -- I’ve mentioned this before - and she gave me such a strong hug, she actually loosened one of my teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was about to fall out anyway, but it happened at that point in time and I do remember that, that’s a memory I'll take with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  What was your -- sort of your relationship to the other boys? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I -- th -- yeah, what was your relationship to the other boys, did you talk about things, did you --
ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I -- I really -- I really don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I suspect that I wasn’t there very, very long in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> setting, because the next memories that come up -- and this is where I now start to become a person and I do communicate with people, was when Dr. Kalina, who was one of the administrators of this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> /<span class="BUILDING">orphanage complex</span> , took me into his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I -- I -- I suspect that one of the reasons why he did that was because he and his wife were childless and that was a nice experience while it lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Subsequently, they did have a daughter born to them, Mimi was her name, the mother’s name was Helena and he was Dr. Kalina. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Nown Dr. Kalina. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I can’t remember his first name, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Could be Frank or could -- that could have been his brother, but I’ Il tr -- Dr. Kalina is a sure thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I live with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Did you remember at that point, did you think back to your parents and to your sister, while you lived there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I honestly did not connect to the past in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I just lived in the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My sister was though, however, constantly on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I knew I had a sister and I knew that somehow I was going to meet her and whenever things got tough, I said to myself, ““This is -- I’m going to do this for my sister.” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Whatever it was, whether it was a small problem or a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But I lived in the present and I must say that the people really treated me very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and I do remember there was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the back and I don’t know if they bought this for me or for their daughter that was born, but I suspect it was more for me, because she was really a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They bought a little goat. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">This story I don’t think has been told ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">A little goat and I had sort of responsibly for it, it was in a sort of a gardened off or a <span class="REGION">fenced off area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And it was a very sweet sort of little thing and I fed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I remember it pulling lettuce from my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That’s a very sweet experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He also -- Dr. Kalina, now that I’m thinking about it -- he was -- he had an -- obviously an important position and he was somewhat well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He- he had one of the few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that private citizens owned at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It was a green <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convertible</span> and I guess as a boy I would have -- I would have loved to have driven that thing, but I enjoyed riding in it tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There are other things about that experience with the Kalinas. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They allowed me to do things and I especially remember Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I don’t know why I think of it as Sundays, but I’m sure it was a Sunday, they would always give me a couple of coronas -- money -- Czecho -- Czechoslovakian. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And they would let me go to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">local butcher store</span> and I was able to purchase 10 decagrams of salami, which was the delicacy bar none for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Once a week I was able to do that -- that little bit of pielites living with the Kalinas also. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There were other things I recollect. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It’s the first time I think ve ever heard a phonograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they had a very fancy phonograph combination bar set, that opened up, the lights went on and there were glasses and played beautiful waltzes, music. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">These just -- little details, little details. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Ho- Ho-Home with ka -- with the <span class="BUILDING">Kalinas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  You mentioned salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">At that point, you were not educated in the Jewith -- Jewish faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">No, not at all, I had no idea about the laws of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kashrut</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I think at th-that point in time -- I -- I don’t think they were observant to any -- a great deal either. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">At that point in time, food was more the important thing, rather than yo -- than any of the restrictions on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kashrut</span> was -- I don’t think I’ve ever -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> -- I’ve heard the term, I’ve seen the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouses</span> even -- not <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouses</span> as such, but places where they kill chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So -- so I know there was a ritual to it, but I -- as far as forbidden foods, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I -- I had no idea of anything being truly forbidden, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Yes, I went to -- to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And that was quite an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I think I was the only Jew, besides one other, in my whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I’m really sad to say and til this day I -- I find it so difficult to understand why we were really so disliked. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">W-We looked just like the rest of the kids, we didn’t publicly appear -- I mean we did not appear Jewish in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We didn’t wear hats or yarmulkes or had long hair or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My only mark was my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That branded me a Jew, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And this other fellow, his name was Sobol, I don’t think he had a number from any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but he was Jewish, they knew he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Maybe he looked more Jewish than I did, if there’s such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But th-the boys, even the -- at that age, we were like eight, nine, 10, they were -- they were out there to beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Every day they could catch us after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they -- they actually waited for us and we had to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Run for our -- not for our lives, because we were not old enough to really do that kind of harm to each other, but we had to run, because we were going to be beaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Do you think they knew anything about what that number meant or does it just -- number, Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation, I think, even -- even while the war was right there, still hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the e-extermination, I’m sure, was known about, but the hatred, I don’t think was wiped out of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Or of this innate insensitivity to Jewishness, or anti-Semitism, whatever you want to call it, people were brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with, it was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I think the Germans most probably had -- looking back now, part -- part of that is -- as -- as their plan to -- to make -- make their actions seem -- seem plausible, reasonable, even likable. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So they had this propaganda machine and I’m sure that they spread very not nice things about the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So it just carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Did you tell anybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Did you tell Dr. Kalina about the persecution at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or the beatings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Well, Dr. Kalina and that beatings at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that did not quite overlap together. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Those beatings at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> came a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Dr. Kalina -- I was with him -- out of the -- my entire stay in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , not very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I would think maybe about a fifth of the time that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He had to run off because somebody in the organization of his administration had something against him and they spread some news about him -- he was Jewish also and somehow he had to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So he left me with his sister, the Maun family. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Edith Maun, here -- that’s Frank Maun. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Yes, that’s the name, Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The Maun family. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they had two children, Otto and Beebe and they lived almost a -- just a block away or maybe even less than a block away from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This is the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I’m referring to, where these -- where these things took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And so it was with them, not the Kalinas that -- that this -- these chases and beatings and whatnot took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Was it difficult for you to so quickly change, after you had just found people you liked in Dr. Kalina and then move onto another family or was that more like the extended family of --
ANSWER:  It was -- it -- it -- I -- 1t didn’t seem to affect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">L-Life had so many changes 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I’m- I’m just trying to philosophize, now looking backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It did not seem to phase me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Things happened quickly, differently and it was just -- 1t was -- I think I just lived more or less for the moment, for the very immediate future time -- a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I -- 1t did not bother me, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything else, any particular impressions from -- from that time that are important, that have stayed with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That’s a four - five year period there, there are lots of things -- lots of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My wife being a school teacher, I’m a little bit of -- of -- sort of into school authority kind of thing and I do remember, in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , when you misbehaved in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , that was a very -- very difficult thing to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Teachers actually had permission -- in fact I think they insisted that they hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I do remember, we used to carry our own sticks with us and when we were bad, we’d call -- be called to the front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in front of the teacher’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and we would hand him the stick and he would dish out on our hands, which we extended, you know one, two or whatever the punishment was. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I do remember that -- that as boys we had the discussion -- did we bring thick sticks or very thin sticks? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Because the thin sticks would sting and the thick s- sticks would sort of, you know, just hit you flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But I must say that order was maintained in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There was none of this that you hear today, in 1997, where you -- where a teacher looks at a kid the wrong way and the teacher runs -- and the -- and the child runs <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to his parents, then the parents come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the teacher’s in big trouble and so 1s the administration in big trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">This is like -- it’s so absurd to me, that things like this happen today and when I think of what happened then. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And nobody really -- was really hurt by this -- by this punishments. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was -- 1t was scolding 1n a way that kids understood, I think, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And that’s one of the things I do remember of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  So, for you the punishment in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was more -- yo-you took it to be an -- an act of just normal discipline in certain ways --

<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  No, no and in fact it was -- there was a ca -- it was almost an orderly thing to be happening, just to be hit and then be told to go back to your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and behave, rather than being shot and never getting up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I mean, you were taken care of properly, in a way, properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Schooling, since -- since we’re on the subject of schooling, the last two years that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , the Russians began to take hold and we had to take Russian language as a -- as a language, that was a re-requ-requirement that we all had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And so I learned the Russian alphabet, we -- this 1s -- this was a must, we had to do all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Things that I didn’t want to do in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Another thing that sort of -- I had trouble with in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was religious instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We had priests giving us instructions and they even took us to -- to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don’t know how, but I always ended up at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and many times I didn’t quite make it into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> itself, but I do remember having to have to go at times and crossing myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Which was -- I know not the right thing for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Don’t ask me how I knew, but I knew this wasn’t the right thing for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Were there aspects of it that you liked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That’s a very interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I -- I’ve never focused on anything that I liked in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , other than I did enjoy playing soccer, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Yes, we did -- we did devise games of soccer and that was -- that was a very -- that was very exciting for me, but it was also, it was -- it sort of got all that extra energy out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">When you were able to run -- yeah, running was always -- seemed to be the thing I’ve been doing, either to good things or to bad things or for bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Yes, playing soccer was a very enjoyable kind of a activity in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- <span class="DLF">school grounds</span> or away, because they were lot -- we were not far from fields- from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , anywhere you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> at the time, so we pl -- wherever we could, we set up a soccer thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Did you have any relatives anywhere who were looking for you in the meantime while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Well, it seems yes, I’ve had some relatives left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They were looking for me- this is my father’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there were other relatives alive, but I don’t think they were actively looking to -- to -- to get me -- to get a hold of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My -- my mother had a sister alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , so I had a cousin there and an uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And my -- the Slotkins were not my relatives yet, but I have a feeling they were starting to look for me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They were looking for me, I think, much before I even heard of it, because I think that Irene, my twin, when she told them that she had had a brother, not knowing whether he’s alive or not alive, I think they started to wonder about it and they being the kind of people that they are, I think they made some inquiries about tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Before we go ahead with your life, could you just tell us very briefly what happened in the meantime to Irene, because wh-where was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Well, after liberation, I know now that she was taken to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to live with a family and as the years go by now and we start to hear about some of her experiences, and I’m going back only to 1985, because before then, Irene and I never talked about it -- and I mean never.

QUESTION:  We will stop the tape. -- ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="209">85.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  So you just mentioned that you never talked to Irene about the -- both of your experiences until 1985.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So then slowly, in 1985, she let us know, even though we knew -- I knew from records that she had been taken into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and she spent some very, very unpleasant, indeterminate num-number of months with a Polish family that -- right now I can almost surely say abused her, in terms of her being a child who was taken into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I think she was more like a servant, made to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Some of the things that she tells me are -- later on were to -- were to really go back, return to the site of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and -- and hunt for the -- for some valuables in terms of gold -- gold teeth or what -- whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But not -- not the kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you would expect a child would get. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So -- and the stories that she has, I think are locked in her and perhaps one day Pll find out myself, more about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But then -- then she was rescued from there by -- by a rescue organization -- rescue child organization from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that actually made it a point, because they knew that a lot of the Polish families would grab -- grab children and a lot of the Polish had hidden children that really didn’t belong to them, but -- they were Jewish children and this being a Jewish oriented organization, they wanted to extricate the Jewish children from there and they went into a lot of trouble in terms of checking birth records, birth certificates and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And when something didn’t quite match up in a family, they would know that they had a Jewish child and they took the Jewish child out. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And from there she went to -- when she was taken out, she was taken -- as far as I know, to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  This organization was rescue children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Rescue child. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Herbert Tenzer was an active member. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">There’s a rabbi that lives and still -- Rabbi Fourhand, that I’ve met here on the West Side -- I’ve gone to his little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> a few times, he was also very active and he remembered me and he even has a picture of us kids and he’s a very sweet man and obviously there were a lot of people involved in this organization and this is how Irene got here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  How did your two lives come together again, how did you meet again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Well, I’m living in -- in the -- with Maun family in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , and I have to just mention a few things about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Mrs. Maun, Edith Maun was a -- was a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">She somehow had the understanding of what a boy should be or what a boy would like and there in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I first saw candles -- Friday night candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And from that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was also, for the first time taking in -- taken into a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I don’t know if it was Orthodox -- it most probably was, cause Conservative and Reform were not born yet -- I don’t believe were being practiced publicly in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I remember being there on holidays, being dressed special. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Not being inside the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> all that much, but I do remember having a lot of fights with the boys <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , we were throwing the chestnuts at ea -- at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But Mrs. Maun, getting back to her, cause I -- I have to just say some things about her that she understood so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She knew that I wanted to play -- be a boy, be a real boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And she managed somehow to -- to -- to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And it wasn’t a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">child’s bicycle</span> , was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">man’s bicycle</span> and I was smaller than a normal child, even for my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So, to learn to ride this thing -- I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a child riding a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">man’s bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The foot goes underneath the bar and holding on for dear life and you’re peddling just totally sideways, but I managed to do it and she knew that this was important to me and she -- she -- she trained me and she made me learn how to do this and I did it and I was very proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">With her and her other children, I also went ice skating on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , where -- when it was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And it -- 1t was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I knew that, because many times you could see the water flowing underneath, perhaps the ice wasn’t thick enough for us, but we went on it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">What I do remember about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice skates</span> was that you would just screw these things onto your normal regular shoes, because we didn’t have special shoes for skating, we just -- those were our -- our shoes and we just forced them onto our feet and there was a special key and they would just lock onto the shoes and we’d be skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I don’t think I ever told that story to anyone, but it’s wa -- some of the things I remember from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Also, somewhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> , after this bicycle episode, somebody obtained for me, a very fancy -- they call it a jek -- there’s a kolabeshka, but I think it’s a -- I don’t even know what the English word for it is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It’s -- it’s some wheels, it’s -- it’s a <span class="DLF">platform</span> , a wheel on the back and the front and then there’s a stand, what do you call that, a -- I’m at a loss, totally at a loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It’s -- it’s got a wheel on the front, wheel on the back and handlebars coming out from the bottom of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Is it a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooter</span> -type?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  It’s like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooter</span> kind of a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Did you push with one foot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  One foot, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">You push with one foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But this was a very fancy model, so I suspect somehow <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had something to do with it, because it had a spring on the back, spring on the front and a brake on -- in the back, which you just press and it would just sort of hold against the rear wheel. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That turned out to be my means of locomotion in -- in- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I was seen through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I mean I was really fast with -- at least I thought I was very fast, I was -- was my -- my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> to -- my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escape wagon</span> , my little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Was red, chrome, beautiful little thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  So that was the first time that you could really play and -- and be a boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Probably the first time, probably the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And thanks to Mrs. Maun, I have to give her that credit, she -- she knew that I needed this -- something and 1-1t was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">She -- she -- she gave it to me, it was wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  I would like to stop here, this is the end of tape one, side A. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rene Slotkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This is tape number one, side B. I would like you to say a little bit more about the two children in the Maun family. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Did you get along together well, or was there some jealousy on their part, maybe or -- what was the -- the feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were younger than I, much younger and I could tell that from the pictures even now. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So we didn’t really play as equals. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We played as children would play with each other, living in the same <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I do remember Otto being sort of a -- he wasn’t as sports oriented and as outgoing and -- and as devilish as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">He wouldn’t -- never try that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> that I had tried and there were a lot of things that he wouldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So that factor and the fact that he was much younger, didn’t allow us to really play a lot together. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And then there was Beebe, she was a little baby girl and -- what does a te -- nine year old, 10 year old have to do with a baby girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So there wasn’t much there, but duf -- I did feel a real family there, because Mr. Maun was a -- he’s a very quiet but very strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He was a dental technician, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And Mrs. Maun was an outspoken lady, but very strong also and together they -- they ruled this family and I felt some structure, real structure there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  But eventually you did meet Irene again and you were still thinking [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, it was while I lived with them, that we start to get communiqués from -- from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , that there were people looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And also, at the same time, we were somehow connected to the people in -- to my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And there was sort of talk, letting it known -- be known that I might be going to -- to one of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , that I'd be leaving them. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I -- there wa -- it was just talk and it didn’t really phase me one way or the other, it was just talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The -- the first thing that did happen, though as -- as a movement away from the Maun family -- at one point in time, I do remember going with- I’m not quite sure now whether it was both of them or just one of them, the parents -- they were taking me to the -- to the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where I was to be met and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and somehow it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I suspect now, from what I can gather, that at the same time, the Slotkin’s somehow came on the scene and they, at this point had Irene, who was my twin sister and I guess it seemed much more sensible to try and unite the two twins into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or just unite them, rather than keep them apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So I came back into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , back -- I mean I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> with the Maun’s and there we waited until some move was made by the Slotkin’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And that -- that this happened, it happened -- they had sent a Mr. Enright, who I think on his own right worked for -- for the children, possibly for this organization, but he was specifically sent out to see if he could find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And he spent quite a few months -- over a year I think, maybe even two years, looking for me until I was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But there are lots of coincidences that I’d like to mention -- I should mention -- that happened, which made this possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">In -- in 1947, Life Magazine ran an issue which depicted my twin sister Irene as sort of a poster girl from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , with a boy, Charles Karro and somehow th-their publicity was to raise funds for this organization and for the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and for the children’s welfare care. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The Slotkins somehow got a hold of Irene, cause they were actively involved in helping war orphans and they were very close friends to Herbert Tenzer also, who lived 1n th -- in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> that they lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And Irene came -- came to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And that wasn’t a -- quick as I make it sound, she went through a couple of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , but she ended up with them and she told them that she had a brother somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And so they started to look for me, realizing, I guess the importance -- as I think as a father now -- grandfather, I would do the same thing -- I -- I -- I -- if I knew that I had in possession a child who had a twin, especially from -- from that kind of a background, I would see if I -- if I could do something, especially since they were able to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So they started looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Now the Life Magazine that I mentioned before, this Life Magazine was obviously read by more than just the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but it -- 1t was read by people in Europe and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , where Dr. Kalina was at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He saw the article and he realized that Irene Guttman, who was mentioned, I think, in the article as Guttman, maybe even Renata, I’m not sure now. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Renata or Irene, but Guttman was the -- was the name which I was under and the twin story and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So he made the connection and he said, “I have this twin, I have the brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I know where the brother 1s.” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So contacts were made and I was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> and then came the -- the red tape of getting me out, getting a -- I -- I look at it now and I laughing, I wa -- that little orphan, took them two years to get me out and even once I got here, I still had to go back once -- back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but that -- that’s just a side issue of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But it took two years of red tape to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I must say that in the time I spent in getting ready for it and the travel and -- and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Went -- had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> and then once I got here, I had -- was returned back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Was a red tape kind of a thing, I had to appear just for a weekend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> and then come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But each one of these is -- is a little story by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">My s -- my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , my -- my trip to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My stay in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They’re all little stories and I’ll be glad to tell you if you’d like to hear about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one question --

<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Why was it so difficult? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Was it because <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> then was under Communist rule or how -- do you know now”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  I don’t really know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That could have been it, possibly because I was a Jewish displaced child and I was oriented to go or my -- the easiest way to get me out was to get me -- get me a visa to the newly created state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And since I was headed for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was not the way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It wa -- would have been a stopover, but it wasn’t the final destination, so the -- these things didn’t quite match, so they had to make them match. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I think that’s what made it so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There are other difficulties too. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They weren’t legal, political maneuvers, but I -- I think that’s truly -- the Mauns really cared for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean I -- I think I spent -- I ha -- ’'m guessing, but I think I spent at least three years with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I think that, in that time frame, I could see me falling in love with a child that I took care of three years, even if the child wasn’t the best child in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Which I’m sure I wasn’t, but I guess I was cute enough, judging from the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I seemed to get along and obviously she showered me -- they showered me with their -- with their caring and I -- I remembered it’s -- obviously there was a good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I mean, so there are other things in play, but I think they realize that -- that my <span class="NPIP">place</span> would be -- I'll be better off in the long run with my sister in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So, that was one issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I - | think that the Kalinas, who were in a -- who made the connection and originally took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> also weren’t quite sure whether to send me into this unknown and they had some say, because I was staying with their sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, I guess there was a little bit of negotiation going on there, on -- on an -- on an adult level, which I wasn’t privy to, so I -- I really can’t tell you about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">As far as I was -- I was ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I had some things which I unfortunately had to leave behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I was an avid book reader and if I remember correctly, I don’t think there were any <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , so whenever I wanted a book, I had to save for it and I had to buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So they became my personal possessions and I had quite a few of them and there were a few that -- they were American, or at least you’d recognize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">James Fenimore Cooper, “The Last of the Mohicans” was one of the books that I had translated -- that was translated into -- into Slovak and I was able to read that, so I was totally familiar with -- with the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There was one word I -- that comes to mind, which I could never understand in -- in the west, it was greenhorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The word greenhorn, I -- I just didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I know it wasn’t a complimentary sort of a thing, but I could never understand it until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> many, many years later, I learned what the true meaning of the word greenhorn was. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">There were other books that I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Jules Verne was my -- one of my favorite authors, science fiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There’s another man, Carrol May. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I don’t know if that’s -- hits anybody, but I mentioned it to a few people and apparently it hasn’t, but I read some of his books. “</span><span class="sentence" id="339">Robinson Crusoe” was also one of my most favorite books.</span></p>

QUESTION:  That’s him, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Carl May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  Carl -- Carl May, yeah so maybe that’s -- that’s what I’m talking about, but then I -- these we -- these books, these were my treasures and I was told that I couldn’t really take them with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I remember I could take only very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I don’t -- can’t understand why, but I -- I didn’t even have a suitcase to take, I only had a briefcase that I could fill up and the books were not the most important thing, even though I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I wanted to really take some books with me, but it just didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So that was one of my losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Took awhile to get used to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  So you made little excursions of sorts, into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Why and what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Well, my first -- when I first left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it was -- I was alone on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I was met by Mr. Enright -- his secretary, a lady, don’t remember her name, but Mr. Enright played a real big role in my life for the next -- oh, at least half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He -- we -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I remember we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> and now we were sort of closer to the Slotkins, away from the Mauns and I’Il never forget the first ttme they made a telephone connection with the Slotkins, I -- I hid under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I didn’t want to somehow respond or talk, even though I knew about them, I knew who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I mean, didn’t know about them, but I knew they were the Slotkins, who -- where my sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But I was just totally shaken up by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I’m not even sure whether I talked to them that one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> together and -- I mean in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together and there he would carry on during the day, doing his thing, whatever he had to do to get clearances for me and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And he engaged a teacher for me at the time, to teach me -- start teaching me Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And part of the education was to go ahead and see as many foreign movies -- American movies, also English movies, so I would get used to -- I’m sorry, I have to take all that back, not to teach me Slovak, to teach me English. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And part of this whole thing was to take me to see English movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And one of the first movies that I remember was “Lassie Come Back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Elizabeth Taylor, she was a girl at the time, a very beautiful girl, blue eyes, black hair, white skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And there was this beautiful black horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">No, no, that’s “Black Beauty’, that’s another one that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But “Lassie” was the first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Also, there were cowboy movies I saw -- if I can try to remember some of those old names. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">That was way before Hopalong Cassidy came on the scene, it was -- oh, maybe I’ll remember later. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But that was part of it, Laurel and Hardy was certainly part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Abbott and Costello. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">These were movies I went to see, just to get the feel of the language and -- and with the help of this tutor, I sort of somehow got myself started in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I don’t know how -- what I really achieved other than I was exposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It seemed that though, that Mr. Enright didn’t have much luck in getting whatever papers were necessary to get me over here right away, so -- there was -- and he couldn’t spend any more time or something like that, so I had to be brought somewhere, put away somewhere -- who to leave we -- me with. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So it was decided to send me to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383"><span class="BUILDING">Institute Usher</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balaban</span> , which was Jewish oriented I’m sure, because the headmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had a beard and a yarmulke and I do remember Friday night services, now that I think about it and we always stood up to La hoda di lacross kallor, which is one of the prayers that we say in our Friday nights also, but we sit down, where we always stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Now I know why I stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I always stand, for some reason, La hoda di lacross kallor, sa -- sa -- about two pages responsive kind of reading on Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But most people sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I always stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There are a few other people that stand, but now I know where I got it from. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They always stood over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">That was <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And that was a -- that was a really, really wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I went skiing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I do remember going skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We would get on to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , which would take us, even though it was a rainy, cloudy day, would take -- they would -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> would take us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , above the clouds, into bright blue skies and sunshine and we would ski. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> also has other -- lots of good memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">At this point, I had the funds, now I had the backer -- a rich backer in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my sister and her -- her future adoptive parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So I had some money, I had some credit, come to think of it, it wasn’t even money, I had credit at the <span class="BUILDING">school office</span> where I could buy candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I remember it was a very specific kind of a marshmallow chocolate covered candy, very delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">One other thing about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which I remember very, very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> -- in <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and every morning we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> in another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , while it was still dark and cold sometimes -- very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So we ran through whatever yard there was in our nightclothes and into these showers, which were somehow automatically regulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You get into them -- they lasted only so long, the water started from lukewarm to warm and then it slowly start to cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So you had to do your thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You had to get soaped up and you had to get clean and still try and enjoy some of the warmth that was left after you’ve done what you had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But, that it ran cold and if you were brave enough, you stayed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And it turned out to be a lot of kids did stay in, most of us did. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And it sort of -- it was a very healthy thing to do, because I don’t ever remember being sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">None of them ever got sick and we ran wet -- half wet into our- into our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> from -- from the <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I do -- that was something I remember again about my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There I learned also -- there they put me on a program to learn Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So I started writing, copying things in Hebrew, even though I had no idea what I was -- what I was saying, but writing, copying things in Hebrew and trying to pronounce some of the things, Hebrew started then for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  How many languages did you -- did you learn by then in this -- in a rudimentary form? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">At least <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slova</span> -- Czech?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Well, I’m sure that my parents spoke German to one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Czech will be the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Oh definitely, Czech definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">As a matter of fact, when I -- when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I did manage to sneak out one book -- yes, I had one book called “Oatsa lubby luge.” </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don’t even remember what it -- actual -- it’s -- it’s a ray, some metallic ray, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But I did my first book report on a -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , on a book that I read in Czech and I guess the teacher trusted me that I wasn’t going to distort the story too much and I wrote a book report on it, in English for my first school book report here. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, Czechoslo -- Czech was the other language, Hebrew, of course, start to come in very strong and English, which I had to communicate in. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And Russian, which I took in -- in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosheetza</span> , which I had to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So -- and whatever language was spoken in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , which was many, many languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They’ re --
QUESTION:  So five -- five languages? [</span><span class="sentence" id="424">inaudible]
ANSWER:  Probably -- posht -- at least five languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  So what happened after <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Switzerland</span> was my last stop, I think, before I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">On the way, we went back to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I think that’s where we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Was a big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I think it was the double-decker -- propeller driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , but it was a double decker, was one of the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And we landed at <span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span> , which is now <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy Airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431"><span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span> was nothing but a long <span class="BUILDING">Quonset hut</span> with -- with dirt on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and you just had sections which designated the different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airlines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I remember the night, 1t was a night -- March -- March 29th, 1950 and my mother came to pick me up -- my mother -- Mrs. Mey -- Mrs. Dinah Slotkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It comes very easy to say my mother to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And came with Mr. Enright and it was evening, it was raining -- misty rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I don’t think I saw my sister that evening, yet, because it was -- must have been too late, she must have been asleep already and I remember that we were told to sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">master bedroom</span> and M-Mr. Enright, like we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , he slept in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , I slept in the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the following morning I met my sister in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and no words were spoken, none. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Just looked at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I knew who she was, she knew who I was, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We were reunited in 1950, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orange</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Had you communicated before with each other in some way until you -- until you met?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  We wrote some letters, but th-they were newsy kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Well, as I said, we truly communicated -- we didn’t even communicate truly til 1985, when we touched our parents, our backgrounds, our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We communicate yes, superficially, on the level that, you know, what -- where you going, what are you doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We -- we grew up together, we took dance lessons together, we -- we ate at the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> f -- we had the same family, but truly, truly, to find out what she’s really, really thinking, what really went on, we -- we didn’t start to really do until 1985 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Let’s go back to the beginning of a new family. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The Slotkins, what -- what was the -- that family like? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">What was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Do you remember the first time you felt really at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Well, they were -- the Slotkins were fairly well-to-do, I guess, so they had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which was different than the -- what I’ve had before, although I had privacy in -- in the slo -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Maun house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They -- they recognize that I needed the privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Here I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">One of the first things that they did was to get me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Again <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Pretty important, I guess, to a -- to a 12 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And they were giving me everything that they thought I didn’t have -- physically, materially. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I think that they -- they both were very intelligent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They gave me everything they knew how to give me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">How -- what -- their best of ability, they gave me whatever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Whether they were like real parents -- because this question I ask myself, Pll never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I’ll never know what it’s like to really have a real parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">What do you owe a real parent? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">What sort of honor you owe a parent when they’re -- when you know that they’re not yours, really, when you meet them first when you’re 12 years old or when you -- when you know that they’re your real blood? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">That’s the question I -- it’s a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It’1l remain a question, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I don’t imagine it’s the same thing, because I -- otherwise I wouldn’t be asking why -- all these questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So there must be some difference, but I -- I must say that they did everything to their maximum ability -- capability to make us happy, even though I think that -- looking back now, that they made some mistakes, but the -- for example, at one point, German government was -- was ready or somehow in the news to -- to -- they were ready to give some reparation to -- some financial aid to -- or -- or -- make some reparations to Holocaust victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And yet -- or even -- but they didn’t want to have anything to do with it, they totally shielded us from the fact, protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They didn’t want us to associate the facts that we had that sort of a background and -- they just didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There were people who wanted to write books about, very famous Jewish author, escapes my -- my memory right now, but he wanted to write a book about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But they didn’t want to dig up any of the old memories and they totally shielded Irene and myself from anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So they sign -- signed away some of the rights that we might have had and I think that was a mistake, in a sense, because sooner or later, we would grow up and we did grow up and we do question these things and -- and we feel that we have a responsibility to our past and therefore to the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And we have a responsibility to our own children and these things should be known. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It’s not something to hide, to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It happened and -- and you have to admit it that it happened and we have to bring it to the forefront if you want to learn something from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So, I think they made a big mistake in that -- in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  So that was a subject matter that was sort of taboo in -- in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Slotkin house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And it was also not talked about between you and Irene at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Did you talk to others? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">You went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  Did you talk to -- what kind of education, I guess, did you have and did you talk to your new friends or to schoolmates about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I -- I -- we did go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">My sister, as I recall, covered her number with a cosmetic at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It was not talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I -- I don’t think the Jewish community on the whole was ready to even talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They were still in a state of shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I mean historically speaking, it just happened and -- and they were not ready to talk about it or to discuss it and I think that, in the very beginning, my sister might have even felt ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Incredible as that may seem. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I -- I think I felt a little bit of that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I did not always expose my number freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was always a sign of a Jew and in- the sign of a Jew in Europe was not a good sign, it’s something to -- a low sign, something to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It wasn’t something that you were proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Today I -- I’m very proud of it and I feel very lucky that I’m a survivor of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But at that time, it - it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think the teachers knew about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I think the community knew about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But very few really discussed it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I think they treated us gently because of it, but I don’t -- nobody ever talked about it, it was not -- 1t was a taboo subject and I think Slotkins most probably made a contribution to that, but they were just like the rest of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They would not want to talk about -- this 1s something -- let’s -- let’s -- let’s give them what they missed, let’s shield them, let’s -- let’s forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I think a lot of parents did this to their children that were linked closely to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I think they did it to their offsprings. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Why should they -- why should they suffer, why should they know about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Just looking back, I -- I don’t think that was exactly the right thing, but it was understandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Did you feel at the time, I mean wh -- you were now becoming a teenager, getting to be 14 - 15 years old, did you feel that you fit in? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Did you feel that you were truly Americanized, slowly, or was -- were there other feelings that were more complex, difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  No, I -- I -- I felt -- I had no trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I really had no trouble getting to like the American things. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The television -- I played basketball -- I was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> basketball, I learned to drive the day I turned 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I had always a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that I could borrow from my mother or my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I didn’t have my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but I mean I could always borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and there were parties and I was a very social and outgoing -- it wasn’t though, with -- with the public school crowd, it was with the -- the Jewish crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But that Jewish crowd wasn’t anywhere -- the Yeshiva crowd wasn’t anywhere near as observant as -- as the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Yeshivas</span> are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">In other words, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> then, there was nothing -- nobody thought very badly about having dance classes -- social learning, how to do social dancing with boys and girls together and in those days social dancing meant touching one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Now this I think would be totally looked upon as a no-no in today’s age in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Because I know my -- my daughter goes to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- a girl’s high school.

<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Yeah, dancing would have been a real, real difference that I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We did sort of have classes with the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We did social things with the girls, we attended parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Dating, in my circles was a allowed thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Today in -- in -- in the Jewish world, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high schools</span> , even though boys and girls have contact, it’s not for the purpose of dating and having fun with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Because that is not really looked upon as a -- as a serious relationship which will go anywhere, at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I mean, how far can it go when you’re 15 - 16 years old? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So, there’s -- I think, a lot of wisdom in what goes on in -- in -- in -- and obviously my background is showing -- in -- in what the Yeshiva world of today expects from their kids and I -- I agree with it 100 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But I think at the time, I fit in very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I think looking back now and having met survivors over the years, I think -- myself personally -- I’m not even going to speak for Irene, but I think my thinking and I turn out to be as -- as normal, if there is such a thing as normal, as one could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Much more so than some of the others that I’ve met and I’ve met most of them, especially in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985, when we had a -- a convention to have a mock trial for Dr. Mengele and I met -- were twins from all over the world and I must say that maybe five percent are what I would consider normal at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But again, I’m speaking for myself and how normal am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So I think my adjustment to <span class="COUNTRY">American</span> life was -- was -- was easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Specifically, what <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I started out in the Hebrew Institute of Long Island. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Far Rockaway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They then, as we finished the eighth grade, they built a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and so I was the first class of that Hebrew Institute High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And it was a very small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because we were the first class and there were, I think, only 11 of us, inc -- my sister was one of them -- first senior class. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But that was a good thing, because we were always the seniors, we were always the eldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And we got to do everything that needed to be done for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We always managed to play basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We were the first string. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I mean, we played against seniors I remember distinctly, in the Yeshiva High School Leagues and we were trampled. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But we had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We had all the American things that the other <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We had a basketball team, we had a coach, we had uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We had cheerleaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">My -- Irene was a cheerleader. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">She had a cheerleaders uniform on. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">She was dancing around, she was a cheerleader. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And it was -- it was a fun time, it was a easy time. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">It was -- no, it wasn’t easy, because we were growing up and growing up, I guess, is not an easy thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You’re facing the future and here I was, in a -- what seemed the lap of luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">What do I have to worry about? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I remember my father saying, “You have to pick a profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You have to become a professional.” </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I was fighting it. “</span><span class="sentence" id="560">What do I have to do this for?” </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I remember. “</span><span class="sentence" id="562">I don’t have to be a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I have -- we have everything we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">What do I have to be a professional for?” </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So it was -- 1t was growing up, I think with the similar problems that all of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> grows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was not -- it was only clouded in the back scene by the fact where we came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I guess my parents kept that in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I didn’t really focus on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I was too busy having a good time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  So what kind of professional did you become, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  I did not become a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I won and maybe lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Well, the -- the problem was that -- again, here I have to -- and I hope I’m not faulting, pointing at my father, but he -- to him professional meant you were a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I would have loved to have become a math teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But that wasn’t the big three. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So I settled for things in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Accounting courses, this kind of courses, business, bachelor of this and -- so I never be -- really became a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But I was -- I was having a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Even while in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I was having a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Whereas my sister was a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I’m sure that she would agree now, that she should have maybe had a little bit more fun than be a student, but here we were, living in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , twins, somewhat similar backgrounds, yet, because of who she was -- and maybe she was -- she was shyer, more introverted. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">She would turn to her books for -- to occupy her time, study. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">That’s how she gained her strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Whereas I got my strength through dating, playing ball and doing all the things that young teenagers do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  Did you have trouble at all to have intimate relationships with -- with people, period? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Did you have close friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Was it difficult to have intimate relationships with girls?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  I -- I -- no, I never had any trouble with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I’ve always had close friends, both sexes. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Girls -- very close girlfriend, not the kind that you take on a date on, but very close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And I had very close boy friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">No, I -- I never had any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I -- I consider myself -- even today I consider myself a very personable, friendly sort of a chap.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  What happened after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Well, after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> -- this was like 1958 - ‘59. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="597">59 is more I think the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">There was a war on that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was involved in and th-the draft was still in full swing. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I was seriously seeing a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I was, I think 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">20 - 21, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And my life at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I think because of this friction of, “You will be a professional or it’s not going to work for you too well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I -- I have to admit as an -- as an ol-older person, like 19, older teenager, there -- there was friction in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because -- and I think that’s a normal kind of a thing, I think kids want to -- tend to get up and do their own thing and -- and f- fly out on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I -- I -- I was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I got married to this girl, despite objections of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Now, she came from the same community, but not on the same observant level as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Her father was an attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I mean, intelligent people, but they were just not on the same observant level. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Now this was very important to my -- my family, my -- the Slotkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I -- I didn’t realize -- I don’t realize until today how important something like that really is to parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But I also know -- and I think he realized also, that there’s not all that much that he could do -- if these two young people wanted to get married, they were going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, 1t happened, with everybody’s blessings and we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But, at that same time, I was -- I notice -- I -- I was notified by the draft that my turn had come and at the time, I think the only way you could be excused, exempt from service was if -- if your wife was pregnant, you were about to become a father, or some of the other usual things. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">If you were the sole caretaker of somebody, your family, whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But none of these things applied to me, so they were going to draft me for two years, send me over somewhere and -- to fight in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Now, when I told my family about this and my friends, they all said, “You? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">In a war? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">At this point in your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="619">What are you -- there’s no way -- no way you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">There’s no way they’ ll take you if you even -- if you tell them what your background is and that you can’t do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But I -- I never- I listened to what they said, but I never took advantage of that -- sort of -- of that situation, 1n -- in the sense that I would use it as an excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I didn’t want to go into a war or anything like that, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">To me, at the time, the only thing that was really worth dying for, was maybe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But I -- I wasn’t going to fight the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- I wasn’t going to fight being inducted or anything like that on the basis of -- that ’ma survivor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I have this and I have bad this when I really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I didn’t want to go, but I -- I was going to submit to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So I did the next best thing, I joined a six months -- which for me was the best thing -- I joined a six months active unit and then I was in the reserve for the next seven years, which means going to meetings throughout the year and every summer for two years I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Drum</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So I -- I joined the National Guard and I was inducted into the army at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , had my basic training there, went through all the bologna. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But, I maintained a strict <span class="REGION">kosher Jewish front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I had the strength to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I wore my yarmulke, I refused any food, I refused to work on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But I was a good soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I did everything I was supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I was really -- I saw the difference that - between people, for the first time, I -- I got some respect from some people when I did the thing the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My commander was -- was very proud of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Here, I had this -- they were talk -- I heard them talking, the commanders talk about their Jews that they had in their -- in their -- in their units, who were giving them trouble in terms of not wanting to work on Saturdays, not wanting to eat the food in the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> , wearing a hat which was against army regulations and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So, he was very proud of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">My Slotkin, he’s a sharpshooter. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I was a sharpshooter. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But I went strictly by the laws, the -- at the time, in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , they had a chaplain, chaplain -- a Lieutenant Colonel Angle, I think was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But he had made a set of rules for all the observant Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">If they want to maintain their observance while they’re in the army, they have to follow the rules to the letter, not deviate, they’ll be no deviation. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Everybody had to do exactly the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I mean, I was respected, I -- Friday afternoon the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , picked me off -- cleaned my rifle and they sent me either <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or I was put away into -- into -- into the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> which was used on Saturday for the Jews, on Sunday for the -- for the non-Jews, but I was away for Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And it -- it never ran into a problem, except for some of the unintelligent people who -- who didn’t know what Jewish was or what a yarmulke was or what kosher food was and they almost -- some of the southern sergeants, they almost looked for horns under my hat, every once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I mean, there was a lot of ignorance, stupidity and whatnot out there and -- and outrage really. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">When some of them -- when they saw the number and this 1s now early fi -- late 50’s, not that far from the war -- should know what -- what the -- nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Totally ignorant and not sensitive to -- to the issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But I went through the -- through the army and my first son was born while I was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So, if they had had more sensitive tests at the time, we most probably could have proved that my wife was pregnant and I wouldn’t have had to go through this, but I consider it a -- a valuable experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So, when army jokes come up, I know exactly what everybody’s talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">No, army is -- is -- was a part of life and -- I’m -- I’m not all that unhappy that I had to go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was a big waste, but I -- I recognize where -- where army has to be 1n readiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You have to have defense forces, any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has to have defense forces and the only way to have it 1s to have trained people and the only way to train them 1s to -- even -- you know, is to train them. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And you have to participate, so -- 1t’s a given -- given. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It’s too bad that we have such things 1n the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but I went through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Do you remember a particular story about certain insensitivities? </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You mentioned that your commander was proud, but is there another story that illuminates a little bit, the kind of comments that you got, or --
ANSWER:  Well, as I -- as I said, the -- the mess hall sergeants, from -- from down south or -- I shouldn’t really say south, they were from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">If they were ignorant, they were ignorant and they would not have the sensitivity to -- to even understand -- yo -- it’s just talking to -- to -- to a -- somebody totally out of this world, they would say, “What would you do if somebody was shooting at you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Well, of course the answer is you’d most probably shoot them back, even if it was the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And if you had to survive, to eat -- our religion teaches us you have to do anything to survive, so you’|l eat non-kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But this was peace-time <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , not too far away from <span class="BUILDING">kosher hotels</span> , where you could have -- and there’s just no need for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They didn’t understand that -- this duality, that the- that you could be a human being, you don’t have to turn yourself into a total animal, even though this is what the army -- well, this is what the army really teaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">They try to break your spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They break your spirit when they br-bring you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They give you a haircut, make you look like -- tot -- take your individuality away. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They give you a number and they give you a tag and they ca -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they do this for a reason, so you’ ll stop questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But I think at the same time, when you stop questioning, you lose sensitivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So, you have to be very careful with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So -- it happened many times, I was -- you know, my hat was -- my hat -- my yarmulke. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I wouldn’t wear a hat, because that -- that would be totally against rule -- but the little yarmulke, knocked off my head by a sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">There was -- there’s no need for that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">But, of course he didn’t know where I was coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Maybe if he did, maybe he would have acted differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But, my friends -- my -- that I -- that I -- in my unit, not necessarily Jewish, they knew about me, because we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I mean we saw each other in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , they knew I had a number and they asked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And when I told them about it, they were absolutely shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They were shocked that I was even in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They couldn’t believe that I was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But they took care and I took ca -- my care and we -- we did the thing that we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I was fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  You mentioned your -- your son. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">When -- when was he born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  If lremember correctly, it was ‘61 or ‘62. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I think “61 -- 1961 I think it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  What’s his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  I -- Zebbe. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Actually, his name on the birth certificate reads Randolf, but he became known to us as Zebbe, that’s what everybo -- and he likes to be called Zebbe and he’s my eldest, my firstborn and he was born while I was at the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  And the second -- you have -- how many children do you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  [have four. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Three with my first wife, whom I divorced -- we were divorced seven years after our marriage, we had -- there were three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Zebbe, oldest, David came next -- 20 months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And then Corrie, my daughter, she came what -- two years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So that’s the first -- my first marriage and then I have Mia with my second wife of now 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And I must say that when you have a child when you’re a little bit older, it’s a totally different experience, in terms of your output to her -- he -- your input from her to you, it’s a totally, totally different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You -- you understand, you have -- you appreciate so much more, you have -- so much more sensitive to what childbirth 1s all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And -- including the real, actual childbirth methods at the time, were totally different. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In the early 60’s, the husband spent his time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , smoking cigarettes -- which I did too, and the waiting for the doctor to emerge from -- from some dark <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , wishing you congratulations or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And you had no -- no role in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">When my -- Mia was born in 1982, I was part of the operating team, I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I was helping my wife -- not with anything real, but just moral support and I was there and the doctors wanted me there to give her that moral support. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And it was a wonderful experience, and a big difference.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, it -- it -- it was difficult to develop something like this because when my first marriage start to break up, and the kids were still pretty young. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">After seven years, my -- the oldest was maybe six and down the <span class="DLF">line</span> of four, sometimes two years apart and then two more years apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So, when that split took place -- first of all, community looked at divorce differently than it does today. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was a -- almost a taboo kind of a situation, especially in Orthodox circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And obviously there was going to be a -- there was a -- an actual separation from me and my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I did spend an awful lot of time with them, though, while we were together and I think that always showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And one of my stipulations to our separation agreement was that I must -- must have the children on -- on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I mean, not every weekend, but there must be a time, I felt, when -- when the father and his children have to live together like a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Because visitation for two hours on a Sunday afternoon, I felt was an absolute waste of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Maybe better not to even have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Cause it would interfere too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">In the long run with -- kids have parties, kids have this to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Why do you we have to w-wait until he picks us up to take us to a -- I think life had to be lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">An evening had to be spent, a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> had to be given. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Sa -- you know, you had to live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So that was part of my sep-separation agreement, that I would have them at least two -- I think it was at least every other weekend and also in the summertime, I would have them for at least a month, full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So, my philosophy at the time, or what my goals were -- to try to make their lives as normal as -- or as -- without too much change, which 1s very strange now that I’m thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I had so much change, I tried to keep their lifestyle flowing, as it was before, when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">In other words, I tried to keep them in the same <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , in the same environment, with the same friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">That was my -- my goal to do and try to keep everything as normal as -- as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Even keeled with me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And I don’t really know, even now, to what extent I succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I -- my two -- David and Corrie are married. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">My oldest son is not married yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I always wonder -- 1s he not married because something I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Did I put some guilt or did he s -- is he suffering from the divorce, or is he suffering from second generation syndromes, which are very popular now, that everybody talks about -- I just wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But I -- I have to say that all three of them are totally different individuals, I recognized it early in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They had different interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They had to be treated differently, they were little, individual people. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And when my oldest son I -- I mean even when he start to -- when he became an adult, which I -- I term roughly after voting age, you know, I gave him more free reign. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You can no longer dictate what he’s to do and how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">You can advise, I realize that -- which is something I -- I think I learned in a negative way from my father, Meyer Slotkin, which he didn’t really allow me. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But I allowed this, that it’s his own -- it’s going to be his life and I wish he would take my advice and this and that, but you know, you can’t -- even today I can’t -- I won’t even get into a real hassle with my son about anything that he really wants to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We can talk about it, but we don’t -- we don’t confront each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I won’t -- you know -- they’Il be no confrontation. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And my -- my -- my Mia, the lo-love of my life, with the love of my life, June. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I -- I -- I have to say about June, she is the best woman in the world, my wife of 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">She helped me raise those three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I mean she’s -- it wasn’t a sacrifice to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">She had them with me and we had them in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Now here she is, a woman, three children -- my children, they were not her children and I must say she treated them, she treated them as well as she treats Mia -- like in -- I have a source for comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">She treated them as her own, as much as that was possible under the circumstances, for the weekends that we had and the summers that they spent together. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I say they spent together -- she’s a teacher, so they went out to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fire Island</span> , specifically speaking -- and they had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">The kids still talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And I went to work most of the week -- I took a lot of time off also. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I -- I worked -- actually I did everything in reverse. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I worked three days and the rest of the time I spent out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I worked three days a week and the rest of the time I spent out there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We had a wonderful time as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We lived there as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">It was -- it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And just brings to mind, my daughter Mia, whenever we show pictures of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fire Island</span> and the -- June and myself and the three kids, she says, “Well, where am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Where am I?” </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And we have to tell her that she wasn’t on the scene yet, she wasn’t even born yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And -- but she -- she knows, she -- they were very close -- my daughter Mia 1s very close with the three kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They -- they know that they’re brothers and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They’re related and they -- they talk constantly, they keep in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And that’s one of the things that I -- now that we’re talking about a little bit philosophy, I keep telling my children, “In the long run, you only have each other to really depend on. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">You’re --” And here comes this blood thing, I guess. “</span><span class="sentence" id="764">You’re all related, blood related, you have the same father -- same parentage.” </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So, I keep stressing that and I -- and I think that they know that, they understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They’re all in touch with each -- with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And perhaps my son Zebbe was affected by that a little bit in a negative way. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Maybe he felt responsible for the two others and somehow he lost something of his own identity in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">But, I really can’t worry about that, because that’s not a healthy thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It’s his life, he had all the options -- he has all the options -- he still does. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I mean, he can do whatever he wants, as long as he’s behaving himself now. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He ca -- he’s -- he’s a free man, he’s -- he’s a free man. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">My philosophy basically was to let them do, know that they should depend on each other, stick together as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I never tried to push my -- my f - my background into them. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I never told them the stories, never force fed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They -- they were starting to come out and ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">They started asking in 1985, when they first became aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And my son Zebbe, especially now, he’s -- he’s truly into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He really is into the -- he’s a photographer also, so he -- he does a lot with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Somehow he manages to express, he -- he took all the photos that we were able to get from Europe and he arranged them, I have the albums here. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And he sort of put meaning to them, I mean he- he -- he’s very meticulous and he tried to s -- you know, put them in chronological order and he -- I think he made an album for Irene, a copy for myself and he -- he’s into - he’s into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He watches all the latest on -- on Holocaust movies, “Schindler’s List’ for example, he -- he -- he must have seen it many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I saw it once. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Very good film, credit is due there, both from artistic point of view and from -- from a point of view authenticity, even though some of the scenes, they were not quite real, as only I would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But the idea was very authentic and what took place was -- seemed very authentic. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But the scenes weren’t quite as dirty as I remembered them and quite as bloody and -- but good movie, good movie, so -- that’s -- that’s my philosophy with the -- with the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  I would like to talk a little bit more about the very important year of 1985, when you and Irene began to search a little bit more, but I’d like to backtrack just -- just a bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  Are there any particular events in -- that happened here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that were of importance to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I mean, in the 60’s, the Civil Rights movement, later the Feminist movement -- is there anything that affected you in particular, that was important to you, that reverberated in a special way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Bu -- I -- I assume that you mean because of my background, that -- that somehow that would -- I would do a different take on it than a normal American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Just generally speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  Just generally speaking? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Well, I was always math and science minded and Jules Verne was one of my -- one of my favorite authors, so when <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> finally landed on the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> , I -- that was mind-boggling to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I remember -- this is 1959 or ‘60, I’m not su -- quite sure, it was in that time frame, but -- was it that, or was it much later? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Well, whatever the time frame was -- I th-think it was late 60’s, now that I’m thinking about it, yeah, ‘69 was probably more like it, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And that -- that was mind blowing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">It was a superb achievement, but at the same time, we -- we advanced so scientifically, I -- I knew there was so much -- so much suffering still going around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Even today, 1997, 1-it’s -- 1t’s mindboggling that somehow our -- our -- our scientific achievement hasn’t matched our social growth or m-moral growth or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Politics included. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So it -- as impressive as it was -- it was maybe a little disappointing also, that we had to -- but it was a race between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and we won.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">QUESTION:  I would like to just do a brief follow up question. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">You mentioned that your s -- one of your son, the oldest, is a photographer?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">My -- all three of the children, in fact all four of the children went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">The three children went after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , they went for a year to study 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">It -- it was a popular thing, I guess, for parents to do and I felt it was an excellent vehicle for them to spend a time, to mature a little bit, to orient themselves and to know a little bit more what they’re doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Which I didn’t know what to do when I was finished with <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I mean I truly didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And I felt it was a good maturing experience and also, I secretly -- I almost felt, getting the reports from people who spent a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they never wanted to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I was sort of hoping that maybe something would -- would keep them there and somehow maybe I would end up there for -- going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I -- that’s still sort of a dream in the back of my mind, because somehow -- I know I’m Jewish, there’s no escaping it, there’s just no escaping the fact that you’re Jewish, no matter how friendly, how welcoming an environment is and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is the most- probably the -- the friendliest <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for a Jew to live in today, maybe even <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1s -- 1s -- the homeland -- the Jewish homeland, which -- which was always in -- in my f -- you know, background of an -- or focus on and off, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- 1s the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m glad I sent them, I’m glad they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Even my daughter Mia, she hasn’t finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> yet, but she already went last -- two summers ago, for an extended stay of three weeks and she loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Of course loving it at 14 is differently than loving it when you’re 16 or 17, but they all had a very good experience there. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">My son David is somewhat of a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">He studied there in the Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And he eventually became a -- got a degree of rabbi, which 1s just like a doctorate in Jewish studies, but he became a rove, he got the smeeha, which 1s the equivalent of a doctorate in rabbinical studies, I guess, from <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> and he now is -- he’s a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westchester</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mamaranak</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And his wife is also a teacher, she teaches handicapped people -- hard of hearing and unable to speak, she talks in sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So they’re both teachers and they have three boys, which means of course I have at least three grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And they have a wonderful life together. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They -- they have summers off together, which is -- which is something that I always encouraged my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">My -- my secret desire to be a math teacher, part of that plan was to have summers off, so that I could be with kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I love kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So, as it turns out -- as -- I love children, I love to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I mean I could -- I just -- thought came back to me, which will throw me back into the <span class="BUILDING">Slotkin house</span> , if -- 1f I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> and I became -

<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Well, I knew, when I really divorced, that I could never live alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I mean, I knew that th-there -- I would have to be, cause I’m that type of a person, I’m not a loner, I -- I need to be around people, with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And so I knew I would marry, but obviously right after divorce I wasn’t ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I-It’s strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I met her through a coincidence of -- of the Slotkins again, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">My father, Meyer Slotkin was best friend with -- with a gentleman called Daniel Meyers, this is down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , who used to pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">My memory 1s -- of him is pick us up Friday afternoons, half wet from a <span class="INT_SPACE">Shabbas preparation shower</span> , cigarette dangling out of his mouth, driving 100 miles an hour, picking us up to go to <span class="BUILDING">Shul</span> Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And they were best of friends and Daniel Meyers had a son who was younger than I, but we -- nevertheless, we knew of each other and this fellow, Jonathan Meyers, used to live one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> down from here, where I live today. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He married a girl and they used to spend summers out on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampton</span> -- in the Hamptons -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amagansett</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And my wife, being a teacher -- teachers all have summers off. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They also spend time on the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> , if they like <span class="DLF">beaches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So they met up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And then when my separation came about, Jonathan and his wife -- Jonathan and his wife and I -- f -- Pll try and remember her name later -- they thought that -- that June would be a excellent match for me, because they knew here very well, she lived with them for awhile and they knew of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So they introduced us. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And so we actually met for the first time, a few hundred yards from where I sit now. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And this was 1970, I think. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="865">69 - 1970. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And our first impressions -- I remember I didn’t want to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but he said, “Oh come, please, we --’’, I said, “Look, I know you want to meet -- you want to make us some kind of a shiddock, you wanted me -- me to meet some girl, or this,” said, “please, I am not interested, I don’t want it, I’m not ready for any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">You want me to come in for dinner, I'll come in for dinner, we’ ll talk,” and this and this, wi -- I walked in and there is June. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I was pretty disturbed, in a negative way, I didn’t want any part of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I found out later -- many years later, that when June saw me walk through the <span class="DLF">door</span> , she said to herself, ““There’s the man I’m going to marry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So first impressions is what sometimes work and sometimes they don’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">But they’re a valuable tool for some, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So that’s where I met June. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And we started dating very, very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I must admit, she was first much more aggressive than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">But I saw the value of her -- she’s a wonderful person, just a marvelous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Then, after a couple of years, I turned to -- I turned to be more aggressive, because she was going away every summer and I started feeling lonely and this and that and so once we made up our minds, we -- I proposed to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I tried to pick a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> -- a romantic spot, because I’m that way in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I tried to pick a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> that would always be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So I picked the <span class="BUILDING">Metropolitan Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">They used to have a <span class="DLF">pool garden</span> around them, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fountains</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">café</span> around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">It was magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The <span class="DLF">pool</span> was huge and it had statues and water was flowing out. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It was a beautiful setting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano bar</span> and this -- this is where I wanted to get engaged because I wanted to always be able to come back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and -- and somehow celebrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">By the -- just by the way, on the side note on this -- this same <span class="NPIP">location</span> was used I think, by Sybill, the picture Sybill -- if anybody knows about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But that’s where it can be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So, we were engaged and married three weeks later and happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Happy, happy, happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I don’t think we ever had a real fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Disagreements, yes, but not any real out and out fight, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And she’s been a mother to the three children.

<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I remember we -- b-before I even go on to that, I just have to say, in the context of what we were talking before, that as -- as wonderful as June was and what a wonderful contribution a woman can make to a -- to a -- to a husband, to a family, to a man like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">It required, I guess, special understanding, because she is very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">But it -- it’s -- it’s been wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">For me, life has been wonderful since I met June. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And the con -- to contrast that, it could be the worst thing if you have the wrong mate, which I also had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So -- I sort of -- I’m just saying, I know what I’m talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">A wife - a true partner, can make or break you, is -- 1s my whole point. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And when the -- the children, when -- when I got married to June were quite, quite young and I think in their idealistic way, they still sort of hoped that somehow things would go back to where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Even though they spent so much time here with us, so they knew that this was the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I -- I have to mention at this point also that at one point in time, the two oldest ones, they actually left their mother’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to come to us -- to live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And we made provisions here for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Corrie, my ol -- the youngest, the last one left, didn’t have the strength or didn’t want to -- or didn’t -- couldn’t leave her mother alone or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So that never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But -- at the -- when the marriage took place, it was still -- feelings were still very raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">There was a lot of animosity and there was -- was a new thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So, we wanted the kids to come to the wedding, but we couldn’t announce it freely to my ex-wife, because that would not have worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So -- and the children were so young, that we couldn’t even tell them, the wedding is going to take place at a certain time and we had to have them dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So I remember, very distinctly, we --we went to buy them suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We purchased them at <span class="BUILDING">J.C. Penney</span> , I remember that very distinctly, they were the suits -- we tried to guess their sizes and dress and whatnot and that weekend that they came -- we were married on a Sunday -- we told them about this and it was quite a shock for them to realize that we were going to get married, cause -- I mean they knew us as being together, but this is a different ball game. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">This sort of made it irreversible or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">But it -- 1t was hard and I even at the -- at the wedding, I have a few pictures where I see Zebbe sitting alone and some photographer caught me tal -- trying to talk to him, his head down and -- he wasn’t upset about the food, he was upset about what was taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So I think it was a hard thing for them, but I think that now they realize how happy we are and they -- they constantly want to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">My -- Corrie wants to be h- here every Shabbas now, even though she has a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which could house all of us on <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , but this is where she wants to be, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room floor</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">She would rather be here with -- with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So I think I -- I managed to get a certain point across to them.

QUESTION:  We will stop for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Let me go back just -- just for one second. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Do you think the difficulties, without necessarily going into detail, but the difficulties that you experienced during your first marriage -- marriage, had to do with, in part at least, with who you were because of your particular experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I think 1t was simply having the wrong partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Also, when you’re young -- well it’s the wrong partner, because you married, as a course of event at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">You finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the next step is marriage and you just stepped into it without too much thinking and perhaps there was a little bit of pressure from -- a negative pressure from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get out and I just wanted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But basically I think it’s because it was the wrong partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Because the difference is unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">QUESTION:  When did you begin to talk to your family and to Irene about the earlier experience again? </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Or for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">ANSWER:  For the first time, Irene and I, although we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , under the same <span class="DLF">roof</span> , we had the same friends, we had so many common interests -- the first time we talked about it was in 1985, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Two years prior to ‘85, there was a convention in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , a Holocaust convention, which I never really paid much attention to by -- by Mr. Mead and his wife and they had these annual get-togethers, but it never interest us, because we were protected from it, we were -- we’re just not part of that scene at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But we had a special invitation from a lady, Eva Core, who formed a twin organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Now this was more our speed, because we knew we were twins and -- and it sort of hit <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">She was a very forceful lady and she said we -- we -- we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our children, we owe it to the future, we owe it to mankind period, just to talk a little bit and let them know what -- what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Whatever the result of that 1s, 1s -- is up to history to judge, but we owe it to the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">We owe it to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And being that I and a -- I and -- and my sister and we never talked about it, it- it was just -- seemed like might be very interesting to hear it from somebody else, even though we knew that we were there, 100 percent, because we had some pictures, we had the numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We wanted to, I think, make contact with others who were in the same -- same situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So, we -- we’ve -- we made contact with them, we joined the organization and in 1985, Eva Core made this -- was the head -- head of this mock trial for Dr. Mengele, to which all the twins in the world were invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">She searched them out and we were all there, that -- that she could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">There were scores. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">There were scores there. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I think maybe like 80 - 85 twins or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And -- some single twins, because their partners, their tw -- other twins didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">But -- there were some small people - what do you call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Not pygmies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Dwarfs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Dwarfs. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Dwarfs, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">There were -- and I think they’re might have been one or two Gypsy, but I -- I don’t believ -- I -- I don’t think -- I don’t remember seeing them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , but there were definitely some dwarfs there in 1985. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And the -- the -- the mock trial of Dr. Mengele took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> and in -- and it was given a lot of publicity throughout the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Dr. Mengele came on the scene because that was his trial and the -- the testimony given by eyewitnesses against him were -- were -- were just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We talked -- not so much during the trial itself, but after the trial, in our <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , we talked to the other twins and they told us what had taken place with them and some of the stories were just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Even to us, even though we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">There was just -- horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">But it -- we made contact, for the first time and this is where I saw the effects that this war had on -- on -- on -- on people, on -- on -- and this 1s where I came to the -- to the realization that I am so lucky, because I think I -- I sort of escaped it, relatively unscathed. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I -- maybe because -- maybe I’m hiding it, maybe it’s repressed, maybe it’s in there somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But I felt -- I felt so much more at ease with the world.

QUESTION:  We’ll stop for one second please. -- </span><span class="sentence" id="963">with the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  Yeah, I -- I -- P’ve -- I’ve looked around me and I saw all these people that were hurt, some actually, physically, were on -- on kidney machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Emotionally, I saw 50 year old girls, twins -- they were dressed alike, they had the little ponytails, braided tails and they’re holding hands together and walking around like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Now, these people obviously were hurt, emotionally, spiritually -- there -- there’s something wrong with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And they all had this look in their eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">This -- this -- a certain look that -- a wild, you know, a hurt look. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And only maybe 10 percent -- less than 10 percent, five percent of the people were people that I could relate to, speak to normally and -- and not be afraid that I would offend them in any way because certainly we -- we were talking to each other much more openly, because we all knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We were saying things that we wouldn’t normally say, but we’re still being very careful and had to be careful, except for a handful. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Truly maybe five percent of the people that we could really talk to freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I think, as a result of all this -- this -- this created a -- a -- an environment for my sister and I, cause I think one of the evenings, we sat down in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we just started. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">It just poured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We started talking and this and -- and you know, recalling our memories, our this -- slowly at first, but g -- and we felt so much, so much relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I don’t know what kind of relief, but just relief that finally we were able to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And I guess 1-1t was time. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">It was just time t-to unload all this and only to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We still did not feel free to talk to the Slotkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Now, my father had passed away already. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">He passed away in 81 - ‘82, but my mother was still around. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">She was still from the old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and even though she now knew that we were public with it, and we appeared on shows and Irene lectures and this and that, she still -- it wasn’t something that was good for Irene to do, because she was totally protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">For me, she -- she knew I was a little flightier and maybe less easily hurt or more extroverted or had 1t more hidden in me, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">But, so in 1985 -- 40 years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">40? </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  Were you recognized by somebody at this -- at this conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Yes, there were a couple of people that -- that recognized me as that little boy, because I was truly one of the youngest blond-headed kid, they recognized me and they -- they let me know that they remembered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And that didn’t do all that much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Well, of course you remember me, I was there, you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But in the negative sense, Irene wasn’t recognized by anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And this hurt her, I think, even though she’s now an adult and I think she still would have liked to have been remembered by somebody -- created enough of a -- an impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">But I’m not all that surprised, because from what she tells me, she was mostly always in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Nobody took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">As the men seemed to have -- for some reason they took much better care of -- of their -- of the younger twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They somehow had an organization and they -- they -- they took care of the younger ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">That ladies, for some reason -- and I can’t understand why, but they did not have the same sort of a set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">QUESTION:  So when you and Irene talked together for the first time, you pieced your memories together, what -- what -- what -- give me -- what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t think we bothered really to piece the memories, cause we -- we had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">What we -- what we tried to -- to do is to -- for the few -- one specific example I can give you -- when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , after we were separated and we were -- like she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camp</span> , I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men’s camp</span> and we were taking to the doctor on an individual basis, even though I guess they knew who I was -- I was a twin to the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">But we saw each other once, through a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , a barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And at that eye contact, no words, nothing was spoken, but we both remembered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">That one moment, that one instant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And I think that’s the instant that -- that gave us the -- the -- the -- the impetus to - to say, “He’s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He’s always going to be alive -- or she’s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I’m going to find her, I’m going to do --”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So we talked about that moment of recognition, cause I knew it was her, but I wasn’t sure that she knew that it was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">But we got that straightened out very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So we talked, but even though we talked for the first time and we were as open as we could, Irene still held back a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And I guess I held back a lot of things, too and I’m only saying this empirically speaking now, because I know how much more information we let out since 1985. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But we talked about it and it felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">It was a relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">It really was a relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And for -- I think from that point on, we realized we’re going to have to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And that it -- good will come of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And it -- it has to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Because questions are asked by people close to you, by your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">They have to be answered, they can’t be -- you -- you can’t put them aside, they have to be answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And they -- in order to answer them, they have to be answered truthfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">As fully and as truthfully as we can answer them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  What happened in your family, when you begin to talk about 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Did you do on your own, or did it --
ANSWER:  No, no, here I -- I have to say that I allowed the Slotkins to -- to -- to -- to manipulate my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Not manipulate by my -- but th-they -- I was always sort of in the same framework. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I didn’t want to tell the kids about my horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I never hid anything from them, conscio -- but I never wanted to either tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So, as they grew older, their questions became more intense and I tried to tell them whatever I could gear to their age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">You know, at -- at six, seven, eight years old, when -- you know, you -- you can tell a kid something, but you can’t -- so but now it’s ou -- all out and they know everything and whenever there is something that’s happening, they want to be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And I think they feel sort of an honor that their father survived it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I -- I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I think -- that’s how they make me feel, anyway, so it’s good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I mean, I don’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  You began to speak publicly about it as well, in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I don’t know how you knew that, but it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">In addition to the media exposure that -- when we were hot, in 1985 and Mengele was on the front page and we were flown out to <span class="REGION">California</span> once, I remember, to a show -- we were on the Good Morning Show here and this and that, but, you know, this was just few short questions, answering to the people and -- and, you -- you know, you were prepped for this, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">You still answered truthfully, but you were prepped for it, for -- but to really get the message <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I thought -- and Irene, whenever she speaks, you can’t do it as a factual thing. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Oh yes, we went -- we were -- so many were killed, we saw people getting killed every day - where they kept marching them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , and there were piles of bones.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Everybody has seen this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">But we thought, to bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , really to -- to -- to bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , is to personalize the message. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">To -- to make you as real as you possibly can make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So Irene does it in a way -- she’s a wonderful speaker, I -- she really is, she -- I’ve -- ve heard her speak to <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> and to gatherings and people are absolutely spellbound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">When she finishes, they -- they just look at each other and there’s nothing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I’m not that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I like to go to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">I -- I would -- I remember twice -- on two occasions, I went to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I actually put the kids on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , in a circle around me and let them touch me, let them ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I didn’t start telling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">I tol -- they were prepped by their teacher, knowing that here is a man from concentration, comes from a -- and I just let them -- let them loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And, you know some of them ask questions about -- kids -- some ask, you know, “Did they -- did they feed you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Did you starve?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And did you this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">These are youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But older people -- much more intelligent, much more sensitive questions, they really want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And they know so little from the history books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">There’s no history out there of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">History doesn’t teach this, the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">It’s just something that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And the Bronx High School of Science, that was the last one that I a-attended a class there -- a -- <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And there were -- they’re studying the Holocaust and they have a very extensive Holocaust exhibition down in their <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> as part of their <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Very, very intense, one of the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And they -- they really wanted to get into it, because they ju -- there was just no way they could get it from history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So getting to talk to them, I got them to really feel -- I try to make them feel that I’m real, you’re real, it really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I think they believe me and that was one of my greatest rewards, because today there are a lot of people out there who say it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">What -- what their motivation is, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">But there are people listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  There is concern, or there -- there is concern among the Jewish community to not put so much emphasis, all the time on the Holocaust as not to take away from other Jewish experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Is that something you are sympathetic with or that you have feelings about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">ANSWER:  There is, unfortunately Jews, like all other people, we’re -- we’re somewhat slaves to the current <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> and -- and if the pop -- the topic 1s popular, people get on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">There’s some people who -- who actually force a living out of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Very few, but there are some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">So, all I’m really saying 1s that -- th-that a lot has been done, a lot has been said, because it’s timely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">It seems to be the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Whether you were -- you can ever totally overkill the issue, I -- I -- I don’t know, I -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I don’t think that you really can, I think it’s a very important part of the Jewish history, but certainly it’s not the happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I think the happening happened a long time ago, when God took Moses and children of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> out of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And I think that was the happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And if all Jews focused on that, they would get a little better understanding of what really 1s worthwhile - or what they should concentrate on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But, certainly history -- and this is the same, it’s historical, you have to look at your history in order to live today and prepare for tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">You just have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">You have to do that and the -- the Holocaust is what happened to us, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And it’s my life, I was turtle -- totally immersed in it for awhile and I’m still immersed in it many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">The -- the just -- you just don’t forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">You know it every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">You know that you’re different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">How different, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I honestly don’t know, but I know that my background 1s different than -- just as I’m different from any other person living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">QUESTION:  You have obviously managed to lead a very fruitful life, a rich life -- still leading it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Are there nightmares left? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Fears that lead back to that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Tra -- memories that get triggered at certain moments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">ANSWER:  I have to disagree with you a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">A little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Yes, I have a fruitful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I’ve -- I have grandchildren, I have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">But somehow I -- I feel that all this -- this -- all this coincidence -- I can’t even say luck, it was sort of my destiny, I feel somehow, to escape and to come here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">To be in the army, to be divorced, to -- to find June. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">To -- to work for a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">To -- to do whatever I’ve done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But somehow I don’t quite feel fulfilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I don’t feel this richness of having lived a truly fruitful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Maybe nothing to do with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Maybe if I would have been a math teacher, it would have been fulfilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">But I haven’t done that and there’s something still missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I don’t know what to attribute this to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">There is something not quite -- 1t seems that I’ve escaped something that was so horrendous that I -- I feel maybe I should have done something unbelievable, but I haven’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Even though, some say an ordinary life -- a -- a rich life or children and education, this is -- is an achievement of it’s own, but I -- I just -- I wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I wonder about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I feel that maybe I should have -- I’ve been destined for something -- maybe still to come, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  Is there something that you would like to say in conclusion to this interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  I think I just said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I feel very, very lucky that I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I’m very fortunate with what I -- what I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I have what I think are the true riches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I have a wife that loves me, that I love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I’m a member of a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I have good friends, I have -- I seem to be healthy, which unfortunately my sister doesn’t have the health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But then there 1s this -- still this -- there’s a little bit of emptiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Unfulfilled something in me that -- that I haven’t satisfied yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But perhaps I will, perhaps- maybe this is one of the means by which I -- I do this, is when I do an interview like this, or when I expose my emotions like this, it takes a few days to come back -- to sort of get back into total norm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Perhaps this is something -- perhaps these comments, perhaps the tapes that I’ve done, perhaps the shows that we’ve recorded, perhaps in the future, maybe that is the thing that’s going to count and -- and -- and serve, which I don’t feel right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Perhaps.</span></p>
