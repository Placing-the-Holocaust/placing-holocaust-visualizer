ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family life before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and her parents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , which was about 10 miles from where we lived and his parents lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I went very frequently with my mother to visit my mother's parents and we spent every summer in one of the nice spas in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , like Francensbat(ph), Cardelsbat(ph), Marinebat(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And so I was very close to my mother's...
QUESTION:  What do you remember about your childhood, what distinct memories do you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My most distinct memories are that I was much closer to my father than to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">He was a very well-educated man who was very interested in education and since I was an only child, he gave me a lot of attention in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He had returned from the first World War with a shrapnel in his hip which was not properly removed, so he was not well, he didn't walk easily and was very sedentary and his greatest joy was to teach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Geography, history, languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This is how he instilled in me a great love for education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Did you come from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  No. [</span><span class="sentence" id="12">have no recollection, others that, maybe once a year, it's a high holy days, my parents went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But other than that, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Did you identify as a Jewish person or Jewish girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was, I don't know how to explain it, but it was just not very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Although I do remember that my parents contributed to, to Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a certain, I don't know how you call it, <span class="BUILDING">piggy bank</span> , where we always put money tn and this was with, in the shape of, I don't know if it was apart, but it was white and blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And we always put money in there and I have no idea where that money went but it was explained to me as a child that this is for, for Jewish people who needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That's all I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  I guess I assume that your friendships were very mixed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Very mixed, our neighbors left and right were not Jews, but there were also quite a few Jews among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was, until 1937, I was not at all aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day, which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That is when I became aware that, that there was a difference between the other children and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That's all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  But nothing that made you feel terribly different? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Were you, were you ever aware of anti- Semitism, early in...
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, at that time I became aware of anti-Semitism and particularly in 1937, there were times where in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , soldiers, Romanian soldiers and particularly Romanian officers, who probably often got drunk, were roaming the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with guns, with the revolvers in their hands and yelling loud words against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Yes, I was, that was when I began to be very much afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Did, did that attitude affect the, your Christian friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I mean, did they pick up the spirit of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  No, not particularly, as a matter of fact, I remember one incident where this one Romanian officer was running through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and yelling, "I'm going to kill all the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">A couple of friends of my father's, my stepfather, this was in 1937,'38, a couple of friends who were not Jews, tried to approach this officer and to talk reason to him and they were, I had completely the feeling that they were on our side, that they were not against us and they were two of the leading people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So I didn't have a complete feeling of being betrayed by every Christian, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But, I can't describe it too well, this 1s how it began.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And then at what point did it get worse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Well we heard then the speeches that Hitler gave on the radio and we kept thinking, well it's not going to last too long, because sane people would not accept this and all, and anyway it's not here, it's somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was pretty close to where we lived, but we still couldn't believe it, we still didn't think that it would find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I can't, when I think of this now, I just can't understand how my parents did not accept my uncle's offer to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They, they simply didn't think that anything could happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we saw a number of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we made <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we lived for them to sleep and we saw how it happened, but we still didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And then in 1940, when Hitler and Stalin made this pact, we had not very much of a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We thought, since we knew what happened under Hitler to people, that we would in fact be better off to stay where we are and very many people were glad that the Soviets came. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Of course, we didn't know what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about life under the Soviets? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I know that you've told me before that your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was taken away from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  What else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  The interesting part was that their propaganda was so efficient, they, there were concerts, the people danced in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There were speeches that there is no better quality of life than in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The children got their education for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The older people got their medical help for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">People were taken care of from their birth to their day they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They never had to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And all of this wonderful thing happened because the Communist government knew how to take care of it's people. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And in the meantime, during the night, people disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And this, this was very, very difficult, because it hit us almost immediately and then one of the Soviets, who moved into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , told me, first of all he said to me, "You know that there is no God." </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And you know this, for me, even though I was not brought up in a strict religious sense, it was awful thing for me to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then when my father was taken away, this man, whose name I do not know, I don't think I even knew it then, this man said to me, "Look, you are a young person, you have the best chance for a wonderful life in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but you have to put an ad in the paper that you want to have nothing to do with your father, who is an enemy of the people." </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And of course I didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">This is how life was under the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We saw a big poster, said, was seen in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Stalin was holding on his lap a child and giving the child a wristwatch, because that child had informed the teacher that the parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had spoken against the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And what the parents had said was, "No eggs today for breakfast." </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the father had said, "Again no eggs?" </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And this was regarded as counter-revolutionary talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The parents were arrested and the child got a watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The parents disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">That was how life was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Did, were Jewish businesses taken away, were people allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did sort of every day life change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  People went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and Jewish businesses were taken away, all businesses were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had businesses could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They had the right to be resettled into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and while the Soviets took away their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sattagura(ph</span> ) or in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then sold them. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Well he was regarded a Capitalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Well he was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And he escaped, my father didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Just for the clarification here, we're talking about your stepfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Was there fear on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , was it better or worse than the Romanians who were hunting down people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">A very difficult thing to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The people who were not arrested and who were friendly towards the Soviet Union, didn't feel that they had anything to fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They thought that it would be just the very rich people who, who should be treated that way, because they, they really shouldn't be so rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But very slowly, it became clear to everybody that you couldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Even though they said you had freedom to say anything, you knew that you couldn't, you couldn't even think against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Now you were about 19 years old, what were you doing at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  [had just finished the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was, I believe it was June 12, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Which was the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It's some 10 or 15 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And two weeks later, June 28, is when the Soviets occupied our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  And you were back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sattagura(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Tell me just a little bit about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> because it seems like you spent quite a bit of time there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> was a wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It was, I believe there were about 100,000 people and a great majority of them were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Very well educated, very motivated towards education and very proud to, to read a great deal and to be considered intellectuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="102"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> was considered the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , whereas <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , as the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , was considered little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , the second language was French, first was Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , the first language was German, because it had belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, where most educated people spoke German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  It was a good life there, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes, I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The parents and grandparents kept talking about the good old time of Kaiser Francioseph(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They loved that Kaiser. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they were very assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They, in fact, didn't believe that anything could happen to them because they, in the first World War they served as Austrians, they got medals and awards and they were proud of that, they, they just couldn't believe that this could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They also couldn't believe that a civilized nation like <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could do any harm to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Do you remember the German occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  This happened one year after the Soviets had occupied us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The Soviets had done a very thorough job to deport a great many people, particularly thinking people, particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The deportation took place on June 12, 13 and 14 I believe, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">This...
QUESTION:  This was an involuntary deportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And it's interesting that we had, when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> many, many years later, somewhere, we had found in a, an old issue of the New York Times, that a very small article that said that people of the Buchavina(ph) had asked Comrade Stalin, had requested to be resettled into the interior of <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> , for fear of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And that Comrade Stalin had agreed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And this was the deportations that happened in the middle of the night against, nobody was asked, nobody asked to be resettled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  So when the Germans came in, what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Were you, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sattagura(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">When the Germans came in I was already married to Sam and I was in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Okay then let's, let me backtrack a bit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You have explained as well as Sam has explained how you got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Didn't really know each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  You knew of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Did he know you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I don't think so, but I don't know, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Because you had studied at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  It's, do you have any remembrance of what was going through your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You went there to find work, you went to the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> to find work and you immediately got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Yes, I do have memory of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My, first of all, I was terribly afraid because I had left my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my mother had said run. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And she had given me a brown bag with some black bread and I believe it was lard. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And also she had told me to put on two dresses, one on top of the other because I could not carry anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I have to run and nobody should know that I'm running. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I put on a summer dress and over it a winter dress and made my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Why were you running there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Because the, this was the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Because the, a neighbor had said, who was friendly with a Soviet soldier, that he had told her that this night they are going to come for the whole family, after they had taken my father away. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so my mother had said, run and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> and stay with this family, trying to remember their name, Isinger(ph), Isinger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Well, it wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">First of all the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When you are under curfew, there were everywhere soldiers and when they saw somebody moving they stopped him and wanted to know where are you going. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Well, I knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> very well, I managed somehow to make it to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">All night it took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And when I came there, the Isingers(ph) told me they could not put me up because there was a raid in this <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and a number of people, whole families, were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">At that time they didn't know where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We know now it was to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And so I had nowhere to go but to the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonic</span> , which also housed the <span class="BUILDING">Conservatory of Music</span> , which also housed a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> , which was called <span class="BUILDING">Keynote Central</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When I came there, I was dead tired, because I'd walked all night and I knew the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I went up into this <span class="INT_SPACE">projection room</span> , from the movie, knowing that nobody would be there at that time and I feel asleep o the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I thought when I wake up in the morning, the only thing I could do, was to try to see if I could find a job in the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , because I had just graduated, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So when I woke up it was not morning, it was closer to 12 noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I had slept several hours and when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , this man was just closing the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was 12 and in Europe between 12 and one is lunch hour and I said, "Could I come in for a moment, I'm looking for a job." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And he looked at me and he said, "A job? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">At 12 o'clock noon? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This is time for lunch, not for a job." </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You know, he was very flip and I was not in the mood for, for this type of conversation, so I said, "No, no, I want a job." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">He said, "What, what job?" </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I said, "Well, I've, here's my paper, I have graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> and I am a pianist." </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He said, "Well, now look, how much money do you have?" </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I said, "Three rubles," something like 75 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And he said, "That's enough." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I said, "What?" </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I thought for lunch. "</span><span class="sentence" id="176">No," he said, "It's enough to get married." </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And I said, "No, no, please don't joke with me, my mind is not on that." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He said, "Well I am not going to open this <span class="DLF">office door</span> until I come back at one, but if you want to, you can come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I trailed after him and I thought we were going to eat something and we went into some <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">See, in the, at that time, every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was different from what we were used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So we went up one or two flights of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="182">End of Side 1 of Tape 1]. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So we went up there and a young woman, around 17, asked, sitting behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , asked, "Do you want to get married?" </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And she asked him, "Do you live with this woman?" </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He said, "No." "</span><span class="sentence" id="187">Do you live with another woman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="188">No." "</span><span class="sentence" id="189">Do you have children?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="190">No." "</span><span class="sentence" id="191">You have children with this woman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="192">No." "</span><span class="sentence" id="193">Do you have children with another woman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="194">No." </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Then she asked me the same questions and to me all of this was an insult, because I never even had a date. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And when this procedure was finished, she called over a man who was sweeping the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , whose name I don't know to this day and he was the witness who signed and we got a piece of paper and we went downstairs and as we went downstairs, naturally we spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He asked me, in the very formal German, ——_—sO""—By the way, what is your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And this after we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And so we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , he enrolled me as a pianist accompanist and gave me right away work to do in a certain <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a choir, and told me at five o'clock we meet in front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And no more running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He never asked about my background, he never asked me what happened and he told me he had a mother and a sister at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which I didn't believe, but I had no choice, I had nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And at five o'clock I went with him and when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , there was a mother and there was a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And now it was up to, it was their turn to be shocked because here was their famous son and brother, who had left in the morning a bachelor and had come back and told them, they asked, "Who 1s this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And he answered, "This is another Flor in the family."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Didn't this seem mildly crazy to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Yes, but I, I was very, very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I had, it felt as though I had lost my equilibrium completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">You know, it was unbelievable how that had worked on me, the fact that they took my stepfather away and my mother went every day with food to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where many women stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> , their husbands had been taken the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Or maybe their sons, or brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I think there were mostly men that they had taken at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then one day, my mother came, maybe she had already been six weeks, every day and one day there was another guard and he said, "He's not here, he never was here." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Let me ask you something, this is just sort of an interesting point, I mean if the men were taken away first, this, didn't this put the women of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in a completely different role and situation now? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I mean in terms of their responsibility and...
ANSWER:  Sure, sure, cause they had to do everything, they had to fend for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But that didn't make them more assertive, they were very courageous, but women were not very assertive to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So it was just a matter of survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Did you see a change in your mother after your father was taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And, and even when my mother survived 17 years of <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and even after I found her again and she came to us here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , when I tried to discuss with her what happened there, she never wanted to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And she said to me, whenever I asked to tell me about it, she said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">No, no." </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And then I said, but, one day I got very angry and I said, "They took your husband away and they killed him and you don't even know where he's buried and you don't want to talk about it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And she answered very quietly, "He was an enemy of the people." </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And this was the man she loved and believed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So they had done a very good job on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I finally got her to tell me that she would, she had promised that main chief there never to talk about this event. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He had said to her, "If you ever want to see your children again, you will forget all that you lived here, all that you saw here." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And she never wanted to talk about and to this day I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Except here and there a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">She told me about this guard who had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I think it was probably only one child, one little boy and when he knew that she knew languages, particularly French, he wanted her to speak French to him and he gave her a glass of milk a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And she, her <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> were slightly improved, she shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a lady from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> whose husband was also taken away, but he was taken because he was a leading Zionist and his name was Weiselberger(ph), very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I think he was a lawyer, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So with this Mrs. Weiselberger(ph) she shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and then when Kruschev came to power and somehow permitted people over 65, if they had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...
QUESTION:  You actually told me this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Yes, to, to come out, so Mrs. Weiselberger(ph) came out and brought along a letter from my mother to her brother in <span class="REGION">South America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  And you were able to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Yes, that's how we...
QUESTION:  Some of these <span class="REGION">areas</span> that we've recorded, I'm going to skip over because in the interest of time and your energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  So, you were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Did that, I realize many, many years later that it was a good marriage, but in the beginning was that terribly awkward for you or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  I can't say how it was, I was completely dead <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You know, it was often an irony to me, that when the Germans took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> a year later, the Soviets had done such a job on me that I was not able to be more shocked, more afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They had already killed me, <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">To me, you know, the word <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , as you may know in all of Soviet or Russian literature, usually meant that people never returned from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So, I don't know what else to tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  When you say that the Soviets had already destroyed you, you're talking about by taking away your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Not any personal brutality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Just by, and you know, it was so strange to think, why do they have to resort to such terror? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">If life is so complete that each person is taken care of from the day of their birth to the day of their death, why do they have to, to terrorize people by taking them away? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">If they want to take away a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , why must they send this person to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">If they want to take away somebody's <span class="BUILDING">flour mill</span> or somebody's business, why must this person be destroyed? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know, almost all these people would have been perfectly satisfied to become employees of the, of the government in their former own place of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But, as I think back, I know that the reason must be that they had to destroy the middle class and that's what they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  What happened when the Germans came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">When the Germans came in, it happened very fast, so fast that the Soviets could barely run as fast as the Germans followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was by that time already, they had undergone the, the Soviet terror of a large group of them being deported and nobody knew where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Only now do we know where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And, of course the coming of the Germans meant that they will first of all go after the Jew that were still there and so most of the Jews tried desperately to run with the Soviets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  You and Sam, what were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  We were, we, we knew that if we stayed, the Germans will kill us, but we also knew that there was no way of running with the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And, but still, we went down to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and there were guards, but you couldn't get through the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to go east, because these guards were there to make sure that first of all, all the Soviet Russians should get over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So they didn't let us through and we, and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we said if we have to die, we'll die in our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">A friend of ours, who is a, an opera singer, his name is Paul Marco(ph), he had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> when the Soviets came in, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , under the Romanians who were allied with the Nazis, he had no future at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Well, he was able to get over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , together with a group of Russian singers. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And his story is unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He knew, the more he got into the Soviet Union, the more he wanted to get out of there and couldn't, couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Anyway, we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Were there bombings? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">How did the Germans come in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  We heard bombings, we heard the noises of war, but we stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and one or two days later, I think was that they came in and took all the men out, I think Sam may have told you about this and took them to what the Soviets call the _, the <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Culture</span> and there, I believe that, I was sure that I'll never see Sam again, but he has told you that, that he managed to get away from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  Well, you've told me as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">See I don't think... They used Sam to dig <span class="DLF">graves</span> for, I don't know how they did it, to count one, two, three and every third person, I don't remember exactly, but somehow he found his way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  So at what point did you have to leave your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  You know, I don't know, I don't exactly know when it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  Well wait, let me, do we have a sense of whether it was a few weeks later, a couple months later, a few days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  It was, I think a few weeks or months later, not immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  What happened in these few weeks or these few months, were, would you go about your business, could you go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We were permitted one hour a day to go out and to get some water from a <span class="DLF">well</span> , which was about a half a block away from where we lived and we went only women, never a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were sort of in hiding, but we really didn't have where to hide, we were in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I think this was a few weeks or months and then came the...

<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We knew nothing and we knew that one day, some day, we would be deported, but we thought that it would simply be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , where people have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">After all, there was a war going on, so if everybody had to give their share, probably we had to work, we didn't think of anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  Need some water? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Now you were probably in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for about six months or so, is that right?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Do you remember the mood or how you felt on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Unbelievable, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">First of all there was so many people that you could not move and of course we didn't know where we were going, we didn't know what expected us, we didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And of course the people who had to relieve themselves couldn't do it and had to do it and then after several hours when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and then opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they permitted and, people to get out and relieve themselves, they all relieved themselves right there, in front of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It became suddenly just so humiliating, so terrible, our life was worth nothing.

<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  How did you get out of there, did you have any thoughts on what would happen next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  No, we had no thoughts, but one day they came and made the roll call and at that roll call they set aside a man who was a glazier, a man who was a carpenter, a man who was a, I don't know, builder, a doctor who was a surgeon and they called Professor Samuel Flor and he didn't move, because they separated the people that, these few people, the builders and that were in one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and all the others were put on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we knew this <span class="NPIP">side</span> meant across the book and Sam didn't want to budge and the man said, "Are you Samuel Flor?" </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And he said, "Yes, but I'm not a professor, I am a dentist." </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So he put him, he told you this story, he put him in the corner together with the surgeon and with the few people who were supposed to fix up the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , ___ was in the vicinity, we didn't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And then Sam said, "I do need a person who, who can help as an assistant." </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And this uniformed man said, "Do you have one?" </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And he said, "Yes, I know one girl who is a good assistant." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And he took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They didn't know that we were married and this is how we began to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We walked from Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph) probably two or three days until we came to a point, which was LaDiing(ph) and then we walked a little further and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toolchin(ph</span> ) and that is where they had to fix up the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  Who went to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , who was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was, I imagine for Romanian soldiers and maybe occasionally for a native who lived there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We were put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toolchin(ph</span> ) and in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we had to stay and every morning we were taken out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and in the evening we were brought back by guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we, we worked to clean it up and to, to make a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense of freedom at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Because even if we were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , we were not allowed to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We were brought there and we were brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">No, we never had a sense of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  Were you afraid or did you feel somewhat safe there in Toolchin(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  We were always expecting the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We never felt this 1s good, or this is, nothing can happen to us, no, this, this was impossible, to think that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Was, was this a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It was, I think it took place in Toolchin(ph) in a couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span> where Jews lived before, the Soviet Jews, because they, they, some of them remained there, not all of them ran with the Soviets, some of them were older people, couldn't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So this was, I would say, as large as, maybe three or four blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">One <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were demolished from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> didn't have <span class="DLF">windows</span> , I mean they had <span class="DLF">windows</span> , but no glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And when we came there, we lived a sometimes four, sometimes six to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">When we were settled, we were, let's see, Sam's mother and sister lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we found a possibility to move into another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , Sam and I. And for a short while we lived alone and then they brought a man very sick with Typhus and nobody wanted to let, to have him, cause it was very contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And we were very young, we didn't care, we didn't have, we were not thinking that something could happen to us 1n that way, so they put him into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he shared the, this was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , it was made of a piece of wood, you know, but it was not directly on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , it was a little higher, so we shared this with him, what do you call this? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Platform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Yeah, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Well, the man died after a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Sam had a wonderful conversation with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He, he said to Sam, "Someday when you survive, I want you to play the violin on Yom Kippur for me and to play _——_—£"". </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And you know, Sam did it, last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He went over here to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , to a Rabbi Holien(ph), told him the story and the rabbi said okay and he played it and it was beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  I want to do something, just a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">How organized was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Yes, it was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But I don't know very much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I know that there was, there were a couple or three more prominent men who ran it, so to speak, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But I have no idea what their function was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Who guarded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Well, I think it was Romanians and Germans, because, more Romanians I think, the Romanians had more of an authority there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Were there Jewish police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  I don't recall that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Was there a system for you to get food or get medical help or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  I think there was some sort of a system that the Jews among themselves made, to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> , I think there was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But I do not recall whether there was medical help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Were there any activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did people at least privately, worship or sing or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yeah, maybe there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I don't recall exactly what it was, but I do recall that there was one very talented poet who sort of made little ditties pertaining to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and put them to music and sang it for us and making fun of our lives, yes there was some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  So there was...
ANSWER:  Not all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  But so there was some, some humor and some way to compensate for...
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about conversations or whether people had any thoughts about what was happening, whether or not they'd be, get through this or how to get through it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I don't recall that anybody talked about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I know that when I discovered the <span class="DLF">hole</span> underneath our <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I knew that the time would come when we have to run because we already could hear the, the shooting, the cannons and you could hear that they're coming closer and these things don't happen overnight, not in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And we knew that the Ukrainians, who lived outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would not hide any of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They would simply, even if they wanted to, they would be afraid to do it because they would know that they couldn't get away with it and we also knew that you couldn't even hide 1n a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> because they, it was winter, there were no leaves, you couldn't hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, so the only way that I had the idea was that we should cut open this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and hide underneath, which everybody thought was insane.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  Did you have contact with the local Ukrainian population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Yes, a little bit, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">There was one dentist, a Ukrainian who came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and when Sam needed, for instance to make a crown for somebody, he had to give it to this man, to this dentist, who was a technician, who made it and brought it back to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">This, he seemed like a very decent guy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Do you think he shared information with Sam?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Never, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He never spoke about anything but the dentistry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  It's, in a way it seems a little far fetched that Sam, all of a sudden one day became a dentist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  How did you pull that off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  It was unbelievable, but you, but it was a matter of life and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">If, if he didn't say he was a dentist, he would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He would have been sent across the __. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And the, he didn't, he wasn't so frightened because he had next to him this good friend the doctor, Dr. Rard(ph), who was a very prominent surgeon and he was sure that Dr. Rard(ph) would pull all the teeth for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And you know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Dr. Rard(ph) had to operate on a German captain who was brought in from the front and he died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">operating table</span> and Dr. Rard(ph) was taken out and was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And suddenly Sam was without his friend and the only thing we could find was an old book in the Russian, which we had to study, a dentistry book. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We found it in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I read it to Sam and translated it for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">That's how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  So every day you'd study a little dentistry and he figured it out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">He was brilliant as a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">He pulled two of my teeth, I don't know if I told you that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  __ you all decided not to stick with the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  He didn't want to, but they offered him at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Minnesota</span> , a scholarship or fellowship, they were so impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He gave them a speech about his experiences and they wanted him to study, he didn't want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  I'm going to wait for this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> to pass over. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Your sister and mother-in-law at this point were with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Sam's sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Right, your sister-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Yeah, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  So they were able to come to Toolchin(ph) as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  I'm going to jump ahead...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  To the Czech army experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">After liberation you joined the Czech army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  By the way, the liberation was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">When, when we finally didn't hear any more shooting and we were downstairs, some 78 people, I don't recall exactly how many, we expected 18 people to be downstairs because those 18 people knew about what we were doing, you know, they were in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But when the Germans really had to retreat, they began to shoot people and so all of a sudden they came in, came in, came in and we were 78 and you know, we were, right above us was our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> there was just straw, you know and then suddenly, we, we heard heavy boots like German boots, you know, you can't mistake that, above us and we were as quiet as possible and we heard them speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We knew at that moment that they must have found us, but it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They happened to have entered this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they put a cannon in front of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they used that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep over and we were underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">At first we were quite sure that they knew we are downstairs and they are going to just kill us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But then, the next morning and you, we were So quiet, you could just not imagine how quiet you have to be and the next morning they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And after they left we were still there, quiet and then we decided we couldn't stand it any more, we could begin to feel smoke coming through and we decided we couldn't do anything but at that time they had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And when we came out we were just pale and green and, and there were a few Russian partisans, maybe boys of age 13 or 14 who came and they looked at us and they said, in Russian, ——_, "And who are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They didn't know who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And we asked them, "And who are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And they said, "Me Russki(ph) partisani(ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Then all we could think of was to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But that, that was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That was not possible, we had no way how to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Then, one or one trucker came by and had heard that there are some Jews who, maybe Jews have something to give to them, maybe they'll give them a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he said, "If you give me some vodka, I take youto _—_—_—-.£". </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So we, so a group of us got together and whatever we still had, a top or a blouse, or something, we exchanged with some peasants for vodka and we gave it to them and they took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And they took us maybe two or three kilometers in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and dumped us in there and said, "The Germans didn't do a very good job with you, they should have killed you all." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And then we had to start walking, that was our liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Did you believe you were really liberated, I mean did...
ANSWER:  No, we couldn't believe it, because first of all the war went back and forth, it was not just in one direction all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The, the Germans had left, the Soviets came back and you could think, okay, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">No, then the Germans were lucky or there were not enough Soviet soldiers in that one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , they came and took back part of that <span class="REGION">area</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We were, we were absolutely torn back and forth, we didn't know from moment to moment when the Germans are going to be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It was unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  At what point did you join the Czech army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  When we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , in the hope of getting back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">Sam's apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I never tried to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sattagura(ph</span> ) and at Sam's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> were some people who said, "You better get away from here before we call the police, because if we call," these were again the Soviets, "1f we call them, you're going to land in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And we had heard from other people that this is, in fact has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">People who had survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and who could think of nothing but to return to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , returned to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where some people lived, who maybe paid nothing for that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of for that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but considered it their own and had a powerful weapon, that all they had to do is to say, "These people are no good, they are enemy of the state." </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So we quickly disappeared from the, from this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , didn't pressure them or anything and it so happened that the Czech army passed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Want to ask you a question, before you continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Did you think that maybe you'd be, your mother would return at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  I didn't even know whether my mother was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I didn't know anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  But had you thought of going back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in case she was alive and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I never thought of going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I couldn't even think of going back to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">In that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we had heard, this long back that the Jews that had not gone away with the Russians were killed in the one night before the Germans came to occupy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , by the native people. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They were all herded together on one <span class="DLF">hill</span> and they were all killed, I don't know how, I don't know whether they were shot or with knives or what, but they were all killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  So you just had no thought of going back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  When, at this point did you have more information about the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">killing centers</span> , did you learn anything more at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  We knew that there were, there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> , you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> and some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the vicinity, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bareshot(ph</span> ), I don't know if these, this means anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But we didn't, there was no time to dwell upon what happened in those other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because you were constantly busy trying to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  What does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I don't know what it means because really you...
QUESTION:  Busy trying to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  You were not involved with what went on somewhere else, you also didn't know it, there were no newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You depended maybe on the rumors and in fact, you didn't want to know too much, all you wanted to, was from day to day to see whether you could make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I don't know how else to explain this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  You've told me a little bit about the Czech army before. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I'm, I'd love to hear a little bit about some of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that you liberated with the Czech army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  What kind of experience that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We were, in the Czech army, I have to say, it was a moment of a wonderful feeling, to not be less than a louse, as we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where they had power over us and we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">In the Czech army we were constantly facing the enemy, maybe one or two miles away, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The Germans were in front of us, the Soviets were behind us or next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We were allied soldiers of the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But, the sense of camaraderie between the people in the Czech army was absolutely magnificent, these were Jews, but not all of them were Jews, there were quite a few non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">These were people who had run away from Hitler into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , when Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they didn't know that the Soviets would occupy that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and when the Soviets came, the Soviets regarded these people as unreliables and put them into <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Cause they said they weren't sure who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , at a certain moment in time, there was, everyone who was Czech was asked to join the Czech army. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The Czech army consisted of all kinds of people, Jews and non-Jews, but mostly Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Women, children, old people, sick people, anybody who could walk, joined the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It began in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boosoulouk(ph</span> ), in the, in the very interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Russia</span> , where, where the majority were concentrated and there were about 5,000 people who made up this army. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">These people were so magnificent, most of them very, very well...

<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  So you never returned to Judaism in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  I do not know really what I am, but I do know that I have the highest feelings for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , for the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the greatest pride that there is such a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">If you can understand how this works, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">But I could, I've been trying to think about it and it is difficult to understand, you know, when I was a child, there was this teacher, Hebrew teacher, who was trying to teach us to read Hebrew, but he neither explained each word by itself, nor did I know what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And he never bothered, or maybe he, maybe that was the way it was taught, but I, it remained out of my _____, where in my mind I was always curious about languages and I would have liked to know more about this language, this man was not forthcoming to give it to me, so I gave it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And that is all I know about Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I didn't want to learn to read Hebrew when I don't know what I'm reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Because it did not coincide with all the other languages, 10 of them, when I read them, I know what I read, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  Was it difficult to begin anew here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  It was not difficult, it was magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">It was, we were so full of hope that we are in, in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , not just <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so, the whole way of life is so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We went about it, we were very excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And we had a baby and the baby was born here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and Sam, who couldn't speak English, found a job to play the violin and everything was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">No, it was not difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And we never felt that we had to ask somebody for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">We were so proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">You know, it took years and years before I ever heard that there was such a thing like a, a family service, who helps people, so we never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">We were really very strong, I must say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  Wasn't it hard to get over what you had experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  Yes, there were those nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I couldn't talk about it and when Sam talked about it, I couldn't stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">But these were, as time went by, less and less. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But it took about 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  What were your biggest challenges? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">You must have had some, I mean you were starting a new life here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  We didn't have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We lived in a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , in a one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , not <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a man who wanted me to write receipts, he was a landlord, write receipts when the people brought the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And for this he gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where the one <span class="DLF">window</span> went directly to another <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So we lived very primitively and we were as happy as can be because it was still so much better than what we had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">You know, everything is just relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And I taught Sam English, I read to him books, endlessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And our, our best way to entertain us was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">It didn't cost anything and we kept on reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">That was our beginning.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I don't, I don't think that we have ever, we've been the two of us, rather self-sustaining because of the circumstances and after that, also because of circumstances, maybe it's a baby and then his mother came and was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">She had cancer of the stomach and died in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and at that time, she was ill about eight months, the doctor gave her six, and we had no insurance, it was tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">But somehow, the fact that we had survived the Holocaust and that we could be here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we just thought nothing can hurt us any more.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">QUESTION:  If you had to, the word survivor probably means a lot of different things for different people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">QUESTION:  That if you had to summarize a commonality that survivors share, is there something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Either in terms of experience or in terms of, how it, how that life changed people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  [have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">This to me is so incomprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I wish I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I have no idea what makes a person a survivor and another one not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Of course, you have to have health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">If you don't have that, we have seen too many people perish, just simply falling by the wayside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">You have to have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Everything else, I think you have to remain with a cool head and I always thought that when you are in such danger, you have to have an even cooler head and see if you can be one step ahead of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">But I have no idea how that works.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  What about, when I use the term survivor in the sense of having gone through these experiences, was there a commonality to the experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">ANSWER:  I suppose so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I suppose that when you find, in the experience of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , people who befriend you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">They, they'll be most wonderful and do everything and you will do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And then you will find others who take everything away from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So it 1s, I think it is the same, like in the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">QUESTION:  Was there something in the process of dehumanizing you, of having, somebody having this control over your lives and abusing that control, that you think is common to the experience perhaps? </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I'm not trying to put words in your mouth...
ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">QUESTION:  ...I'm just trying to understand, your experience is different than many other people I've talked to and yet you've all had your lives torn apart, disrupted, lost family...
ANSWER:  Yeah, yes, exactly, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I think a personal experience of someone controlling my life like that, I, I can't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">But I also thought that, because of Sam, who protected me, I think that I was only too willing to be protected and too grateful and to this day I'm grateful to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But I have no idea, I think I, I think that in some ways we were also fortunate with the way things came, were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But, whether we were fortunate or smart, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  You know, it's interesting to me that you refer, you've referred several times to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and how awful it was and yet as I understand it, you really were only there a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And this seems to be such a...
ANSWER:  You are, you are talking of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carrera(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">ANSWER:  But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toolchin(ph</span> ) was also a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">QUESTION:  Ah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Because I was...
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We didn't call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Only the fact that Sam was used in a certain profession and I was used as his assistant and that we were taken every morning and brought back every evening, maybe it made it a little easier, you know, but it also made it a little more dangerous, because every time Sam would have made a mistake on one of the soldiers or officers, that would have been the end of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">So, so he was in very big danger and I call that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , even though it was called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  That's, I guess that was maybe what was confusing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I want to ask you to talk about one other thing which I know is not easy, but it's very, very telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And that is, you know, we talked earlier about how as people get older, a lot of these memories flood back and I know your husband hasn't been well lately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Can you talk about that a little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  Yeah, ask me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  Now your husband Sam has, he's had a stroke, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER:  A couple of mini strokes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  And so his mind is not always clear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  But can you describe how when his mind 1s not clearly grounded in the present, what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  He talks about, as though he were back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he gets, he could be in, among 20 people, like in that <span class="BUILDING">senior care center</span> and he'll take off his shirt and start scratching and the doctor asked him, "Sam don't do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And he'll say, "I have to do it, I have all these lice." </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And the doctor said, "You don't’ have any lice." </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And he says, "Yes I do, yes I do and we always have them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So I know that he's there and this doctor tells me that there's no use that I should try to convince him that he's not there because he believes so in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And this has happened a number of times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">QUESTION:  This happens at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and with people and here at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , with guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And he'll say, "When are we going to leave this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And I'll say, "But this is our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And he say, "No, don't tell me this is our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , this is not." </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And then he'll say, "We are going, we have to go back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I'll say, "No Sam, we are not." </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I can't convince him.</span></p>
