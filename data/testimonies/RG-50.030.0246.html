<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Helen, tell me about your childhood? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Can we talk about that for awhile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My...I was born in a...in a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And when I was about 3 or 4 years old, my parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was very unfortunate that, uh, my father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and had difficulty to get permission to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I do not know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I only know that we had to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">1914, the first World War started. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I was 5 years old and the laws in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> are still the same, that the wife and the offspring takes the, uh, well, is is the same citizen of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So my mother, who was German...her family was there for centuries....and I, we became all of a sudden Russians because <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And as Russians, we were the enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we would have been interned if we couldn't live with my grandparents who at this time came from a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They're quite old. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We thought at that time old. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And, uh, my aunt, my mother's sister, had taken them tn into their <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and so we shared their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we were not register...registered at the police which meant like living underground, illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">All this naturally was not told to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was much too small to understand that, but I do know that when I was 6 years old, I was supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and it was not possible to go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because my citizenship was Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And, uh, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , an excellent <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , liberal, and my mother talked to the director and he understood and let me come in without birth certificate or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I started when I was 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was absolutely a fantastic <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I found out later in the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And, um, it was so broad-minded and we learned so, so...everything so much, uh, so directly, so uh intensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and were connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">One were girls and one were boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And, uh, it did not happen before we were maybe 13 or 14 that we were brought together with the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Even some of them naturally one had already seen, and, eh, in between the hours, but boys and girls in the same class at the same age were taken by the teachers to outings, which I thought was a very good idea and everybody liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh, I was in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until I was 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Because when I was 16 and I thought it was the end, they added the three classes that you could go in there if you wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ...you wanted to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That's what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Helen, what was it like growing up as a Jewish child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  I couldn't tell you, because I thought everybody was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In some way I was not aware that the children I was playing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with were neighbors that they were not Jewish, because all the children I knew were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="38"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and, uh, was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at that time too. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It...I was... was thinking I was living in a Jewish world. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We were not that very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were liberals, as it was called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And my parents went to the high holidays to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We didn't live far from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and, uh, there was no Sunday school because most of the things we had in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We had very little Hebrew lessons, but we did uh have the Rabbi teaching us the history of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  I understand you were married in 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Would you tell me about your husband and the circumstances of your marriage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Oh, I... In 1933, I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I met...I met him the year before, but I, uh, I had..I had to work uh besides going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to finance it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There were no loans at this time, and my parents were not that happily financially to afford that. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I, 1t came out, I made very good money, so I was in a situation to support myself and help my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I decided I wouldn't get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Why should I get married? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I saw no reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And, uh...I had a boyfriend because just everybody had to have a boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was the, uh, style. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But, uh, all of a sudden...I had known him from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I said in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> 's name is Philanthropin, 1f somebody would ever hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Phianthropin was unique and, um, it was a shame that it didn't never come back in any shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Uh...I decided I didn't want to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">After he did not want to get married to me, so I was jilted...and the sour grapes, were I don't get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I could travel, and I was traveling to, um, um, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seashore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> ’ where most of the people who came there in summer were Jewish because the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> did not allow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So the Jews had their own <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and so that's where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And on the second day I was there, I met the man I married later.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I did not want even to talk to him because he thought...he looked as if he was 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was 23 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I was absolutely not interested, but he was very persistent and I found out that he was 28 so that made things a little easier. (</span><span class="sentence" id="69">laughs) And he came also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So we got married after Hitler took power, which was in January 30th, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He had lost already his job and we...but I still had my income, and we got married with the intention to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We were married by the way by the Orthodox Rabbi who married my parents and his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And, um, we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1934 going to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norderney</span> , one of the <span class="REGION">German Frisian islands</span> in the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Siegfried Wohlfarth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Now, the trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ...the preparations of leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time so very early was a little different than it became later. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We could took take everything with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he had a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He was a CPA. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He had gotten a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I couldn't work there - didn't get any permit, being not Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And, uh, I tried to learn the language which is um not so easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It is more of a throat thickness, it seemed to me, than a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I got used to it because I wanted to speak it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I wanted to make friends, and I had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I started without really, uh, thinking about - it a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I. . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">.Now, at first I have to say I got pregnant, and we found out that we would have a very hard time to live on the salary he had and ...with a child you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So I want...I had to think of something...how to make some money to make it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So I was helping the people who moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to settle down and I did everything they would need to uh find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, to furnish the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because they had...mostly couldn't bring much <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I wanted to make it easier for them, and I wanted to make some money on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It developed later in a. . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">into..an interior decorator business and the people I had as customers before told it to other people, and it was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But that was 37, that's when my daughter was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Then, in 1938, came the uh the night of the broken glass, on November 9th, and, uh, my mother called from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and told me that my father and my brother were arrested and uh, what we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now my father had been arrested a few months before, and we got him a visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was very difficult, but when he had the visa he did decide not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He was convinced without any...he couldn't yet even say why...that uh 1t would be over soon, and there was no reason for him to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So he stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My brother was 18 years old and, uh, he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But when my father was arrested, the man who looked at his passport, the stateless one, and he saw he had a visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he said to him, "You're an idiot that you stayed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I'll take your passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I'll meet you tomorrow morning on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And this my mother told me that he was coming the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My brother and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother, we all got them out to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , where we had relatives and we couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And the the invasion came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , which was in May of 1940, my parents, all of them, all of this family, was already in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And we had no chance! </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My father, as uh the man from, you know, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , he uh could have...he could come into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on a visa from this <span class="NPIP">part</span> because at that time there was nobody using a visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">If they would have had to wait for a German visa, I mean German bek, they would have never made it because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not give all the visas they legally were obliged and was as possible to give, but they only gave half or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So...so I...this way my father, my mother, and my brother got into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">What? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">What I did do at what time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  And that was over the moment Hitler came. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Hoping that we would get out, but which was not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So we, uh...we were waiting what the Nazis were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My husband had just lost his job right away, and our child was three years old when the Nazis came and was five years old when we got the order to um appear at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> at 1:30 at night to allow us to bring one suitcase a person and the key to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">This was a. . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">.a strange order. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We didn't understand what really would happen to us, and all our friends came and we gathered in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and talked- "What shall we do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="130">All the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We were five couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We all had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and each of us had a little girl about the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">From all those people, all those couples with each one child, the only one who came back...the only ones who were alive was one man, was my daughter and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We lost them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And, uh, we...my husband and I, we decided we go to the Jewish Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I assume you are familiar with what the Jewish Council was in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was a very large Jewish Council and we bought our order and asked, "What is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">What does it mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And we were...we were not the only ones who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Everybody was confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And uh we were told that we were going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> to work and that we should take our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We hadn't asked about children, but they said, "Take your children because they will be taken care of while you work." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We left this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I decided to tell my husband that I am not for going on the July 15th to get that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And we, being brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which is a little different than other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> um had a hard time to accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My husband said, "We cannot do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This is an order, black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Who knows what they will do to us if we don't go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I said, "Who knows what they do to us when we are going? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We don't know where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And why? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Because Jewish, but (cough) what other reason?" </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So we decided that my husband should get a surgery to give us some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And he found a willing doctor to take out (cough, cough.) </span><span class="sentence" id="156">excuse me...to take out his appendix which was very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So we got two weeks that he could recover and then we would be getting another order. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In those two weeks I've heard that everybody who is working in any capacity for the Jewish Council would get a stamp and a paper that they are at this moment free of deport. . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">.deportation and so I got a job as a cook in an old people's home. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I worked there from 7 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I cooked for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There were 40 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I...if...1f. . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">they paid me five-something like five dollars a week it was a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Anyway, I worked there.. I worked there maybe six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">really can't say. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">In the meantime, my husband had recovered and uh still we did need somebody at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that my daughter was not even 5 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Somebody had to be there since I was practically gone all the time, and, uh, the day I came...I came one morning and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open, and the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> was in a terrible condition and everybody was gone, and most of them were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was a weary feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The people were all financially in a very good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I don't know what was lying around or so or what they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I run out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I thought, "Maybe there's some of those guys left, and then they'll take me." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And they were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So then I was sure, it was not work we were sent to when they take those old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But we had no other way to go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we were not allowed to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We had to wear. . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">wear our star. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We uh could not take public transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We had to walk wherever we were going in this big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We, uh, had special hours of purchasing our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Everything was very, very difficult so you had no telephone any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You had no connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You just...that's a feeling...so we stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they will probably pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That's all we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In...

(</span><span class="sentence" id="189">drinks water) Ja. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Early October, 1942, a very close friend of ours, we knew him for many years and, was a neighbor and, was one of those couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">This was a man who lived through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He came and he said...he was married to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I got them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So he said that he had somebody who was helping them to live underground and their child would be in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> if we would like to consider that. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Naturally, we said...and though...and the next day this man came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">His name was Joe Vis. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He is the...the Gentile who is named with all the others who were helping me in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It's really written for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He [Jo] came and said that they were all blue collar workers and they belonged to uh a very liberal small <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They didn't have much money, but they wanted to help as much as they could and they said, "It is easier 1f you are not together with your child, because she cannot stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> what you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We do not know how long the war will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a child if you want to give her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I would suggest you do." </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We certainly agreed, and a few days later he came back with a couple.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We did not know their name and we did not know where they were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We found out after the war that this woman was his sister, but we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And they came Sunday afternoon and we walked together to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> with my daughter and gave it to her...to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And, uh, we...this man, Joe Vis, he had the days before already with his wife everyday picked up things for Doris, my daughter, toys, her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , her <span class="BUILDING">doll house</span> ...was there waiting for her, and, uh, he said, "Maybe in a few weeks we will have something for you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It's more difficult to get two people a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again." </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So...he...but he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">About three or four weeks later he came and he had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ” and we, uh, he uh...we had two metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , so he took those two and brought it where we were going because the people had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And some pillow cases and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But I have to say in 1941, one year before, my husband who was very far thinking had said, "You know, we should prepare our child that she's not depending on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We don't know - maybe there will be a transport for children to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which never happened because <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not take the 20,000 children they want to send. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We should be uh less warm with her, that she will never miss us. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">No hugging, no kissing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But she should be...it should be easier for her not to miss us. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And * Joe Vis and his wife, Agaat, were instrumental in aiding Helen and Sigfried. * </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Dirk and Stien DeBoers. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">> In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaandam</span> , an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> located just outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">that's what we started, a year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Also, another friend’ took from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> things we thought maybe we should put away. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He offered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And we gave him all our books. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was the most important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But also silver and clothes and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> and shoes and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We had no idea what he would do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We did not ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And uh so when when we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to go into this illegal <span class="NPIP">place</span> there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we very optimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We even paid the rent for this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> until we found out that the Germans had emptied it completely, which was maybe eight months after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And, uh, the, uh...this man who took all our things, we had a contract with him that he had bought our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and that he had paid us so much for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that and he got a receipt from the Germans that they had taken out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that belonged to him, and when the war was over, he got the money.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He'd give to us, because that wasn't a serious contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He hadn't bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and everything was gone naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And, uh, we were living underground from October 1942 til August 1944 in different <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because people got very scared very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Sometimes wanted us to leave the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some <span class="NPIP">places</span> we were two or three months until they got so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were last [Haarlem] we were eleven months and we thought for sure this will bring us to the end because by that time the uh Allies already had invaded in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and things looked very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Thinking in two, three weeks they must be in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and then in August...on August 26, 1944, the day that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated by the Allies, that was the day we were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  What happened after your arrest, Helen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  The uh the people in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived...she was uh a woman with three teenage daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Her husband, as she said, had left...left her when the youngest one was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">She did not have much money, and, uh, the girls were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">She...she prepared our dinner and...cause this is something very important...how one lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Two people alone in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for such a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She prepared our dinner, and we had the, uh, coupons that she could buy food because without the coupons you couldn't live. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Our friends from this <span class="BUILDING">church</span> came every second Saturday and brought us coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The coupons were stolen every month in the <span class="BUILDING">distribution centers</span> by another person. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">All around <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the 20,000 people in Holland who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">When the war was over, it was only 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The others were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And uh they brought us everything we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Any book and we just had to write it down and they tried to get us the books and they brought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And they told us also what, how the war was going because we were cut off from the world because they were listening to the BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">If you are caught to listen to the BBC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , you were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">° Ab Reusink. "</span><span class="sentence" id="263">Two years and several months later, when a special department of the occupational forces arrived, Ab Reusink protested that Helen and Seigfried's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> were his belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Reusink produced the three-year-old contract that he had drawn up originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Thus, the Germans paid Reusink the amount of the contract, which he then turned over to Helen and Seigfried. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They did it, and they told us what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">What was going on and how well we were doing, we heard it from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They also told us in July of 1944, that there were six <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Only. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And there was one...it was the largest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And by that time two million Jews already had been gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They were telling that and, uh, it was very upsetting naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And everybody was hopeful, very, very hopeful that the end was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So on this day when we were arrested, we were brought to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Oh, I have to say when those men came- there were four men- two Germans and two Dutch, and two of them were downstairs at the front and <span class="DLF">back door</span> , and two of them came up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , they were very well mannered, and they said that we were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They looked at the little belongings we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They saw a picture of our daughter on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , because our friends brought us always picture to show what she was looking because she had gone to...going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then she was very happy where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And she looked happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Uh, the one man said, "If this 1s your child, and if you have more children in hiding, we recommend that you take them with you because you are going into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Here it comes back, the same what the Jewish Council had said. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And you will be...they will be taken care of while you are working. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And my husband and I, we didn't even have to look at each other, we didn't answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Then, they announ...the other man said, "Why don't you take some warm clothes with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Where you are going it is very cold." </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But we decided that we would take nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We went completely without luggage, knowing that we probably would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because this was in some way called a punishment that we did not follow the first time...that we had to be punished for that, so it could only have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, uh, the, uh, the, uh...one, one and half day interrogation by the Gestapo was mostly about giving the names of the people who brought us those cards, because they had no idea who was breaking in and getting those tickets, and it must have been a very large circle.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We are on camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You're at the point of being arrested and there must have been a lot of things going through your mind, one of which was perhaps most important, your daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Tell me what you knew about her at this point and where she was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  What I knew about my daughter was this friend, Jo Vis, who was the original helper and he didn't live too far from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He was very often there to look himself at children. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But, uh, in..at that time before...oh, maybe a year before we were arrested, Jo Vis had in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> always people until he found for them another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So one day there was a man staying with them who had been on the black list because he was in the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And uh he was on the black list and he was hiding there waiting for a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they were all arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He and his wife and there were two friends of ours who came through us to him were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They all got arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">His wife was pregnant at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They let her go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Uh. .. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Everybody else was, uh, sent out. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He went...he lived through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He happened to become a cook and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very well looking. (</span><span class="sentence" id="323">laugh) So, uh...but the two women were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And this was the next man in <span class="DLF">line</span> , his name was Rinus,° a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Um, he was a gardener of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but he was very, very well-informed about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He was self taught man. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And he brought all the books my husband wrote down he wanted, because my husband was writing how the world should be after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And in every way, in financial, in religious, 1n ethical, in any kind of way how the world should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So he got the books he wanted every time when Rinus came. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And, uh, he also visited where my daughter was, because this is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> where all the people who helped us were living, and he told us how happy she was, how wonderful she was doing in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">She was well. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There was really no reason to worry about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The...the woman...her foster mother, or whatever you would call it, was sick...I think for three weeks in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Another couple took over and took her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They told us that afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But she was in the best of hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And though I didn't worry about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Since we did not see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We didn't...we didn't know ourselves where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It would have been very easy to get to her through all the others, but we never said, we never gave a name about the people who were visiting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We just didn't answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  So when they came to take you, this was running through your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You knew your daughter was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Um, what what, uh...where did you go at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They took you and where did they take you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Did they ask you about connections to the underground?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Yes, that's that's what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That's the people who brought there, the people who visited, maybe... We didn't even answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">There was nothing there which would have shown that we were in any contact, but on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there was a map of Europe and what we heard from them where the uh Allies were, we put pins. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">That was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But I think those guys were so ignorant that we didn't even see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We were never asked, "How do you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Because it was not in the paper, but you got it from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Uh, uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Coming...ja...in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was also a lady living...a seamstress’ with her mother, older mother, and this was a spinster who was making dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And I got very close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">She lived, she and her mother lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and I sat down very often- we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She was about my age and I still correspond with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So when we left going down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , she was at the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and I had in my hand a coral pin I had gotten from my mother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I had a very wonderful relationship to my mother-in-law...very. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And, uh, I put it in her hands when I said goodbye, and, uh, that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We never saw the woman, her so called hostess or her three daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And, uh, they brought us . . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">.after this time at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , they brought us for two days to the <span class="BUILDING">Amsterdam Jail</span> which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I would have always liked to (laugh) stay there and wait for the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It was clean and, uh, it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But there were only two days and then they brought us, always in the night, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  It was a foreign world. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Completely! </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The people who had been there for years, they took for granted that this was the right thing, where they would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And as I said, we met good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We met a man there who lived...who had rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Frank's house</span> , at their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we knew him very well because we introduced him to the one daughter of friends of ours and they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Now his wife was at that time when Jo Vis was arrested...was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for her, and so she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Where he went, I don't know, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> where we...were leaving was about two days later and was the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because then the strike came in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The announcement that the uh Allies would come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and the Germans knew that too, and they emptied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There were only 300 people left . . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">.I didn't want- wish to be there to fight out who would be the 300. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And, uh, our. . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">.our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We were sure...we didn't know when we were came there that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but in our mind since we had heard that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp existed,</span> that we were punished...punished for our hiding and whatever, that that was the place where we were going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  What was the transport like? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">What was the trip like to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  A nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">A real nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Um, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was overloaded with people, and, uh, we were, I would judge maybe a hundred and fifty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We had to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I don't know how it was in others because I..I always didn't want to talk to people and ask in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> how was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We...uh...we were standing and, uh, a lot of people died...old people...babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">No water. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">No light. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">No <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And no toilet facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And next to me was a woman who had a little child with her, a little girl, and she uh told me that the people who came to arrest them from in the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> said the same thing with the same words as the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us, "Take your children with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So I thought maybe I did something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Maybe I did not really believe that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So they took us...was a three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> stopped and the soldiers came in and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the money wasn't worth anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Where we were going we should give our money, and my husband decided...we had our money in belt, money belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We had that on, it on all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And he didn't give anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So when they closed again, we started to rip up this money...thousands of guilders. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Wasn't easy to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It's a physical step, also to rip it in little pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And, uh, we arrived in the middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from <span class="COUNTRY">Kanada</span> which we did not know <span class="COUNTRY">Kanada</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They looked very clean, starched uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They'd never answer any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We said, "Where are we?" </span><span class="sentence" id="457">No questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Just getting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> out. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And all the people had brought with them, half <span class="BUILDING">households</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was all gone and people, I'm sure it was at every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the same were very upset, and they always got promised, "We bring it to you where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We know where you will be." </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And, uh, at least we didn't have to go through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The woman and the child and I were together when we started to move in rows after we were separated from the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And we walked...the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> was endless. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't know how long, how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there were, but it seemed endless and there was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we did not know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I said no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to go for me and to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they were taking care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And, uh, this man was very good looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I have never forgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">There were more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> after <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But this was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He was just a perfect specimen of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few months..few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, "Would you recognize him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I said, "No, I'm sure not." </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The way he looked then at his height and, how can you? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So he to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I heard the next day also. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And, uh, there were no Jewish children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , just a few Dr. Mengele wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Otherwise, there were no Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And the mothers were killed with them when they had the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I met a woman who was with us in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">A young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">A very beautiful looking woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">She was very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And after..I had very . .[ </span><span class="sentence" id="484">had hardly any contact with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">All of a sudden she said to me, "You know what I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I knew they would kill the children, and I let my children go," and uh she said, "I couldn't help him them because I would be killed too." </span><span class="sentence" id="487">She knew all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">She said, "I heard it maybe two days before I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I let my children go." </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I don't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I don't know how she lived through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I wish she would be living and that she could have children again. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But that...went with me for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">How do you live with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The, uh, the side where we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this good <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I must say when we were walking to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> I heard voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I heard women speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I heard dogs and I heard music. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I said to the other women I said, "I thought we would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where they kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">This is life. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We are coming into life. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You hear the noises? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You don't have to worry." </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So, uh, we were called into that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> on a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and they all were wearing black satin dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Not the same dress, but the same material, and their hair was beautiful, long. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Young women, very, very attractive women. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we were with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our clothes, strip. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my wedding band off my finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I had forgotten I had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Maybe I would have tried to put it in my mouth or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So they helped us and they found out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and, uh, they shaved us, our head hair and our body hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I knew the Franks. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I did not know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So I heard her discussing with one of those women...the woman..and she was with one daughter...no...she was with two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she should give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, "I bring you every day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And she was very naive and she did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">She never got a drop of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The woman who was handling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">She said, "You have good shoes on." </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I said, "Yes, I am very glad I have good shoes on." </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She said, "Would you like to change with me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And then we came under the cold shower and then we were outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we got a dress, uh a . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">.dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It could have been a size 10 or it could have been a size 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It made no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I got a dress and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night..all that took the to the other night. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We still didn't get to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We still couldn't go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">In the meantime it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And we were, uh brought to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we were exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Absolutely exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And I had a dream which was with me for many years and, uh, I dreamt that I was coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was telling my family and my friends the strange things that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Probably the most upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing everything you had, just as you are born. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I think that was the greatest shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You couldn't see yourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I think it was the greatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">That was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And our young girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> of Jewish girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , girls of 15 years old, and they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> , and they were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and they were all taken, and we had them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Beautiful girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Fifteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">All they could speak was their own language. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They had nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">They couldn't talk to anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They were very upset when they were not menstruating. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Everybody very young was uh concerned, but then it was a blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">What would we have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We had no underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We had nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Can we ..we need to hold it for a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  And you're describing just the loss of menstruation . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  Ja, and the dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The dream that I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and are telling my experiences- with the tatoo, and with the losing the hair, and uh losing everything we had and everybody said, "This is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You are dreaming, just a heavy dream-- that cannot happen to anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="570">The strange thing is, I read many years later the book Night and he talks about people who came back and the people said he must have lost his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">That was years later and so I'm not the only one who had such dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I think there are more people who have dreams on this kind, but I didn't have a...for a certain time and then it was over, that dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Um...
QUESTION:  You're in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes, I am in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We had 10 or 12 people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and it was in the middle of the night when we came, so it was very short time that we could sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When the morning came and the first day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> started, was a roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Roll call in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I'm sure that everybody had about the same experience...that's uh the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder was counting everybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to stand exactly in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I wanted to be little and short and not being seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Later on, I found that the women who were tall were always picked to special things. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They were not always good. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I didn't want to be picked for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I didn't want to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So, uh, we were counted but every roll call, every roll call was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It never came out that we were as many people as they had had on their books. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And the women got very...those women, those <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder, were very upset about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Uh, I still didn't know that they were <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It didn't dawn on me that they would be prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Look at us and look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that didn't work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they found people who were hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and they were found people who had died, and though they put them all there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and counted them, and I think then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Even they mostly spoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">When this roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to get the coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And it was in big barrels and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy, I always volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I guess I was curious to see what the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I think that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">You didn't see much because you never had...got into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and most of the people who worked tn the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and spoke Polish and, uh, for long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between the Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Maybe even stronger, that didn't dawn on me first either. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Eh...

QUESTION:  The third selection then . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Ja. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We were counted 300 people, and as I said, I assumed we're going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Mrs. Frank was in those 300 with Anna, but her daughter...was other daughter’” was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">She was in quarantine. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She had some skin eruptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Germans were very much afraid of skin get contagious or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So she was in quarantine and Mrs. Frank said, "I'm not going with you wherever you're going if you're going uh because I wait until Margot comes back." </span><span class="sentence" id="752">That's what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">She disappeared during the night...went into another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and, uh, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Bel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">She didn't come...she died before she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  Can you tell me? </span><span class="sentence" id="756">This seems as good a time as any to tell us a little about Mrs. Frank and Anna. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">What were they like as people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Now uh, I knew them before and, uh, uh, Mr. Frank was a typical German officer in his '® Margot Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">A very correct, very bright man. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Had an excellent relationship with Anna. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">She had a much better relationship with him than with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And, uh, Anna was a very quiet girl...liked to write as everybody knows and, uh, Mrs. Frank was, as she did the dealing with her shoes, which is, you know, a small thing, when we came that she...that she changed the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">It showed in some way that it was very difficult for her to see the real <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">The reality, what, what could happen, what, what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And, uh, Margaret was a very attractive girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">More attractive than Anne. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But Anne was a lovely girl but she never talked much. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They were...he was a very successful businessman, and everybody liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I don't know why he took all those people into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was really too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Made it very difficult, because to be even with two in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> hiding 1s a great stress. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">To be with the same person with your husband or with your wife for two years in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is great stress and many marriages broke up afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Uh, the 300 women were in another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the next morning we were brought to the original <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camp</span> which we hadn't seen, and we got some food for the day and we were in another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">That was the 28th of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">My daughter was 7 years old that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was a gorgeous day. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">The leaves they were all changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We were going west, what I thought was just the most wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Could only be good, and, uh, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were kept open while we were going and we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They didn't tell us 1t was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It was high up in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ...was nice, and, uh, it was a good feeling to be away from those <span class="NPIP">killing places</span> and from the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">The commandant of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kratzau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kratzau</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which originally came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Hard, hard to find out those things because nobody told you really. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">A <span class="BUILDING">Berlin factory</span> probably...was probably all destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They came and took over this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , which was originally a linen or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So they made...they had all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric benches</span> , and we got boxes of little cylinders, maybe three or four inches long, and maybe an inch hollow, light material, and we had to put the knife of the machine inside the <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">That means we did not do it, but the foreman did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">The foreman turned on the machine and we changed constantly when that shaved <span class="NPIP">inside</span> made the <span class="DLF">opening</span> a little bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">That was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">She said we have a very good <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> here and she addressed us as girls, "Hi, girls."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  Who is she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  The commandant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  The commandant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  The commandant with a white sweater and a turtle neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">She looked cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">She was about 22 years old, and uh she called us girls and she said, "You will have a good life here. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">You work hard, we treat you well." </span><span class="sentence" id="800">It's in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where you are living, not in the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but about 15 minutes to walk, and we clean it all up and we are 300 women in each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So 1200...we were the last 300....1200 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Sounded very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And, uh, but we changed commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">It was always a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Always another woman came. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">All women. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Our caretakers were four soldiers and four women, SS women, young, who were very unhappy that they were in this kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">There was absolutely nothing to do, and the winter was very harsh, very cold, lots of snow and ice, and uh the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were sleeping were very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Not much more than we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They had the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and, uh, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Uh, we were not allowed to use that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , but we did anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Outside, between the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , like in old European places, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in between the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , the in between the first and second floor in a corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">That was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">That was their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I don't know if they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But they built a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , a large <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> when we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">They started to build it. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">We were never allowed to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And, uh, we had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We had uh a little sink in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> which dribbled. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">We had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We could never wash ourselves, and after a very short time we were full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Then they...they deloused us, which took a whole day to get deloused. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They deloused us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> already, and the lice came back after a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And they had big drums where they put our clothes in and we got hot water to wash ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Didn't kill the uh (pause) didn't kill the...we, uh. ..</span><span class="sentence" id="828">the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was working 12 hours from 6 to 6, and we could choose, have a choice of day or night shift, and I selected night shift because they said we would get on Sunday an extra portion of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">That was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Food is still important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So it was very important to take the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So the day shift went, and when the day shift came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the other ones were already on their way there, but, um as I said, the winter was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We had no heat in our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We lost all our blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">A lot of women made underwear from the blankets which when we found that out, we were just besides ourselves, because there were no blankets anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And, uh, the International Red Cross came. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">A great surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Somebody...you know...there are a lot of rumors in those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Somebody said they...a <span
