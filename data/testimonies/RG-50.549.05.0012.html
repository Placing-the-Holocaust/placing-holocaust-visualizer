<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, so we’re just going to start with a test of your voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">How many days were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  15, plus a traveling day at each end. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We were gone for 17 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And what kind of... what was the most memorable sights, some of the most memorable sights that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, the Cliffs of Moher, and believe it or not my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Oh, your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yeah, my brother happened to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> at the same time and we managed to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Was that pure coincidence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Pure coincidence, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I got an e-mail from him two days before we left about my cousin’s cell phone number. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I said what is this all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And called him to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I didn’t know he was going to be there and he didn’t know I was going to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  That’s something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  And we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">That was fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Okay, it’s June the 13" of the year 2000 and we are in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Alexander Rosenberg for an oral history interview that’s mainly going to focus on his experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation once before. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we’re mainly going to be following up on that interview and asking some pre-war and wartime questions to clarify and expand and then moving on into the post-war era. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And my name 1s Arwen Donahue and we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , this is tape number one, side A. I guess what I’ Il do is just briefly summarize for the tape some of what was discussed in your first interview and then you can correct me if I get anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in 1927 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt am Main</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and moved with his family in 1937 to... well, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and between then and 1937 and then moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1937, where he lived until he and his family were deported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And were there, and that was, you said you weren’t certain whether it was 1942 or ’43, when you were...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  That is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I keep thinking it was September of *42 and we were there until the beginning of ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My brother thinks I’m off by a year, but I think he’s off by a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I clearly remember 1 Easter of ‘44 and we had to have been there about a year by that time, so I think my dates are correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And Easter of ‘44 what you remembered was being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  That is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Yeah, it was an air attack... well, a group of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17</span> ’s was returning from a bomb run, possibly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , and the escorting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter planes</span> came down to have a look. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And our super-smart guards decided to let go with machine guns from the <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> and they fired back. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And nobody got hurt, but I clearly remember that incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you a little bit more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , but I guess first what we’ll do 1s... okay, so you were deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> some undetermined date. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And then were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> until 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  “45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Oh, yeah, around April 10", 1945 you were away, and it was close to the time... of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And liberated somewhere outside of, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yeah, east, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tribitz</span> (ph) was the name of the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which is about ten, 15 miles east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torgau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torgau</span> is on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Elbe</span> , where the German and Russian troops met on that same day, April the twenty-third, that we were liberated early in the morning by the Russian army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Let’s go back then, one question that I had was about your earlier childhood before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And you had mentioned in your first interview something about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Your father was an investment banker. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You had a brother who was ten months... was he ten months older or younger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Younger, younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Ten months younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And did you, and you said that your family was not very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">You basically went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Was your family really very assimilated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in particular I would say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My dad certainly considered himself German first and never expected the violence to get to the level that it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And certainly would not affect him since he was a veteran of World War One that was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Had volunteered for the army in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> and was wounded, I believe two or three times and had the Iron Cross, which I’ve been trying to locate and can’t find. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So that I would say they considered themselves primarily German and assimilated is the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Did you speak Yiddish or Hebrew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Were any of your friends, were most of your family friends Jewish and your own personal friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">2
ANSWER:  I think so, but I wouldn’t know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> I would say that was not necessarily the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But I really don’t remember, I remember only really family from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I don’t remember any children from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or acquaintances of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">For that matter I wouldn’t know what their religion was. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So, I really can’t answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And then another question from a different time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">When you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I believe you mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up and deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Now that wasn’t clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  I don’t remember whether I was picked up at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and taken to a collection point where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I walked away from it, and wasn’t challenged in the process and got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  So it was just you? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It wasn’t members of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I think it was just me, that’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five minutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And you were hauled off in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> along with other people, taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> not knowing where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> that the Germans had established; it’s in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we were held there for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I don’t think there were any other deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There may have been one or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> before we were hauled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Why I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But... never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> was... I’m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When we got there, of course it was a very large facility. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Part of it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian POW camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But obviously designed for officers, because they had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And as they started to fill up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , a lot of Hungarians, French women. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They were the wives of officers who were POW’s from the French Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then after the, in ‘44, after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they had been held in camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and apparently under Red Cross supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">When you were heading towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , did you know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> before you arrived? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">3
ANSWER:  No, never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And of course, you know, it’s maybe a two hour train ride at most. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn’t, I don’t know whether my parents ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">No idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They always said we’d be relocating in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Or vague promises of exchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> could buy you and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But no, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and that you had been, you had contracted polio. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by the time that you were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  I would say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some problems with that knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older people when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It must have been a fairly mild case even though polio, of course back then was rampant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I have the impression that your family was fairly close-knit and that you’re weren’t necessarily forming strong bonds with other people outside of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I don’t think anybody formed any bonds at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was a matter of survival and I don’t mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But once we realized, I’m not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn’t and a fellow that was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Nobody really tried to get attached to anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You didn’t form any bonds other than to, you didn’t try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn’t any real friendships or relationships of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Well, there really wasn’t much time either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was there a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No, it was, that was, 1n a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to speak, in that... I remember the first two days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> , there was so much food we couldn’t eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if 1t was only a liter of warm water with nothing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You’re not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It took two days and you ate it all and were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And initially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more and more vicious rather than less so. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and a half, I don’t recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or too feeble or had been wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And you would think that they would be not so hateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they weren’t maybe the first 4 week, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I’m not sure whether they were told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Well you had to if you wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You couldn’t, it wasn’t that you wouldn’t help somebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Yes, you probably were... maybe more encapsulated than hardened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  None, absolutely none. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don’t really remember very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You remember the weird things but not the everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I’m sure that others would have remembered something totally different that I don’t even remember happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Well, because of it, one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that got shot up was the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And one thing the Germans had were cans of beef in its own juice. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled so they had to use them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day that you were deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Anything about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  No, nothing 1n particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They, I guess in the afternoon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was pushed into, the empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was pushed into the compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Then they posted names, they called them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , nobody knew where it was going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you something better. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Of course it never was. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But particularly initially you didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I guess they had to, that I’m sure explains why there was no really massive resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">If you knew you were going to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> you may as well try and fight it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So you get shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I think that’s why there’s, the general docility of the deportees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Had transports been leaving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> for some time before yours left? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">In other words, were you...
ANSWER:  We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don’t know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But yes, there had been others. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where they went or how they were treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you’d be getting on the...
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> and not a permanent installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  And about your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , I’m sorry, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You were there relatively early as you just mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there 5 early on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as... you did mention that it was an advantage as far as food. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the system better?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well system, there was really no system. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But yeah, I think so, because the people who came very late, particularly if they did not come from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but straight from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically more reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But we may have been a little bit more cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And also we were so disease-ridden and I don’t know whether our immune systems had strengthened. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Those are medical issues that I don’t know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">People who were plunged into this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They could not tolerate it as much as those of us who were exposed to it more slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  We saw them almost every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">At night the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We all were in work details. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My mother worked in the, what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="186"><span class="BUILDING">Hospital</span> , there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So, she physically stayed inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My dad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I was on it for a little while before they shipped me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to work details <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My brother was working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> too, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But I don’t remember where, what details he was assigned to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  And what about, you mentioned having to steal food 1n order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldn’t have known how to do or that you kind of eventually learned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn’t steal from each other, generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Even though it was a matter of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I mentioned the Libyans who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They came with humongous quantities of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And we actually buried it between the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> so we could bring it back slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The other thing is being on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn’t have anything on your body that didn’t belong to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was inside a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military training camp</span> , similar to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">A lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they had cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And for a number of months I worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There was another detail inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was chopping them up into firewood. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That’s the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">There were blueberries growing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards. [</span><span class="sentence" id="211">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Boy, they’d take a whipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They 6 would get their food and most of the time if they didn’t finish it, it just sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was probably worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was good food. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They didn’t eat too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They got pretty decent food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he seemed to be more of a... I wouldn’t want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you or club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was one incident that I recall where one of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , gave him <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And he responded in Dutch, “Man, you’re crazy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a Dutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then when we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, “Yes sergeant, this man said I’m crazy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The sergeant said, “That man was right, detail dismissed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We got sent on. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But it varied. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Some of them would turn their back and just did their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But they constantly changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You never spoke to any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Some of them would drop a cigarette butt and walk away. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to pick it up and then step on your fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You never knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  What about friendships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Yeah, you didn’t have time for friendships. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You tried to sleep as long as you could in the mornings. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that’s not the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Roll call?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Roll call, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at night, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to eat and you went straight to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody you worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But most of the time you couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They wouldn’t let you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  So was it seven days a week, every day the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Oh yes, pretty much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Except they got better food on Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They got three cans instead of two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week it was, what time of day it was, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I don’t think anybody had watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Because at noon time they would bring the food out to 7 where you were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We may get five or ten minutes to eat and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And sunrise and sunset, but other than that whether it was ten of eleven or ten of twelve, nobody cared whether you knew it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you were transferred after you were chopping the stumps into the detail that was meeting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail cars</span> as they were coming in, and you said something about the Libyan Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was wondering if you, were you there when the French women prisoners were coming 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  No, I think they were already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="263"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trains</span> came and went all the time, not only with prisoners, but also soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They used the same <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Occasionally we would meet POW’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The Americans always were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They would throw us packs of Camels where we could get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But I don’t remember when the French women came. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">There were only two hundred of them, so they may have come in a group with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Probably since very few of them died, I would think they probably came fairly late. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But I just don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  I read something about it, that was partially why I asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It mentioned they came in the first half of ‘44 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I just was curious if you remembered anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Oh, I would think they would have been longer than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I’m sure they were there longer than that, because first half of °44... Oh, I’m sorry, forty, yeah it would have been about a year and a half, a little over. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Yeah, that’s about right, I would think. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">No, I don’t remember, other than I knew they were there, and... End of Tape 1, Side A 8 Tape 1, Side B
QUESTION:  Tape one, side B of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So you want to just repeat what you had just said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Yeah, later on they brought in women from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I have to back up here a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">There was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where they had a huge <span class="BUILDING">circus tent</span> , was set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That’s where they had the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Apparently, I don’t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for recycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And then also there were a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel holes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And what one of the big, quote, “industries” was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the leather from the rubber heels and/or soles. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And that was done in that big <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And then there was a... the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn’t reuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so they were stacked up in a humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">People, that was my first assignment was working on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn’t just fall over. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And they emptied that, emptied that <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman’s camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been with us, of a fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She had worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she got caught taking some food to try to give to her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And first they shipped her to, I guess to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And she was there in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And ultimately she was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But the police had warned her about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing group which happened to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And so she was back and she was in that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And she went to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That’s how we knew that group had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You could talk to them usually across the <span class="DLF">fence</span> as long as you didn’t get too close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Did you use your German in speaking with any of the camp guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  No, you never spoke to the camp guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I’m not so sure I still could speak German back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But no. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They may give you an order, but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You never talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There was no conversation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> again, you described that time in the first interview and how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Beautiful sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">9
QUESTION:  I thought maybe we could just pick up with that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I wondered if you could tell a little bit more about, well the time of liberation, encountering the Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And you mentioned how they were sharing bread and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Were they, the Russians have... had a reputation for being sometimes vicious even with the people that they liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Did you witness any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Initially we woke up because of... we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> still and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And we had learned, like you said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And they let us off, and so we went on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever, they told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And we happened to go into a fairly large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> along with some others, who... the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but her husband was a minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And he sure was in the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And so we didn’t have any compunction about bullying them. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Somebody, apparently there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I remember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">One of the French women recognized the opportunity and went with the frontline unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And of course, that morning crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe River</span> into the American part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and managed to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , which of course had been liberated the year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I don’t know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they responded. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Many of them were of course in the French Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And so they got the American Army to send two of those two and a half ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> over to come and get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And of course, everybody wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And they promised they’d be back and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I guess in the euphoria, you know, the war was over by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I think we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tribitz</span> (ph) for about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">All of the people that were still alive from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there were about a thousand of them, were evacuated by the Americans and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , where they had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And the Russians let the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> come in and get them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  What kind of condition were you in at the time of liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Barely alive if you can even count that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Many people died because they ate things that they couldn’t digest. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Their digestive system was so severely weakened or disturbed that a glass of milk would kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You just couldn’t tolerate that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You had to be very careful that you ate only a little bit and a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And of course a little bit was always more than what we had had for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So that was important that you didn’t... I remember getting a hold, we heard that nearby was a <span class="BUILDING">Army depot</span> , <span class="BUILDING">food depot</span> , and we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And sure enough there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And I got some... I’m not sure I got cans or an open bucket of condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we just couldn’t eat it, not for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Because we couldn’t digest it, it was that rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  But you were able to walk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">10
QUESTION:  I think you mentioned how much you weighed, did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Well when I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> I weighed 78 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I don’t know how much I weighed then, maybe fifty or sixty, strictly skin over bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">If I would have gotten a haircut, I would have taken a pound off. (</span><span class="sentence" id="362">Laughing. )</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  They didn’t shave your head while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Yes, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Were you with your entire family at that point while you were riding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We were all together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Was that moment of encountering the Cossack unit, were you aware this 1s it, 1t’s over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Oh absolutely, joyous. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Now you had an opportunity, you might live. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Might actually see 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Yeah, everybody... I’m digressing, but I didn’t know anybody on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I guess it’s three years ago now. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we ever took. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a river cruise from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was the first time that I was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I wasn’t sure whether I could tolerate it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We decided on this trip because I could just stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Didn’t have to go on <span class="REGION">land</span> where I would have to be in contact with any Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But one night we’re having dinner with two ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">One of whom, very interesting woman—she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> — and her cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her daughter, the woman’s grandchild, to Europe, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They had discussed Anne Frank in class and she wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">Anne Frank house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And she said, “I told my daughter there’s always long <span class="DLF">lines</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Anne Frank house</span> and if you can’t get in, go next <span class="DLF">door</span> , that’s where your father was hidden during the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I said to her, “Oh, were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> during the war?” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They all had gone into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I said, “Oh, that’s where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I never met anybody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I said, “Are they still alive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And she said yeah, the one sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But the other sister and her husband died after they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They were hauled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="400">Oh,” I said, “to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tribitz</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And she said “Yes, how do you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I said, “I was on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> also.” </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And so that’s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But the irony, irony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother’s closest friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">But no, I didn’t know anybody and outside of that incident I have never talked to anybody who was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">As a matter of fact, my brother is very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He’s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I happened to be talking to him about a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn’t realize, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I was in the same class, but I don’t remember her at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I got to wondering if there is a class 11 picture that exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I’ll have to ask him of the <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Because we both should be in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Just curious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  There is another woman that we interviewed last year or so, who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with Anne Frank as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I don’t recall her maiden name, but her married name was Barbara Rodbell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  There is somebody and my brother knows about it, her, that 1s apparently active in the Anne Frank House Foundation and goes around speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I’m not sure if it’s the same woman or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But somebody that was either a friend of Anne Frank or knew her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  And actually I might be mistaken, she might not have been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was a friend of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Her sister especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But they might have lived nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So, you’re with your family and you’re returning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and you described some, in the first interview, some of that... you were housed first in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  First in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Essentially what it was, was a <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> that was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We could come and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We were not prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They let us come and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Matter of fact, very grateful about many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">De-lousing with DDT. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Think how environmentally unacceptable that is today. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I’m still alive in spite of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But it got rid of the fleas and in particular the lice which was so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">But we could come and go as we pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I don’t remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men, we would get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him what he could do, or what we would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We were pretty nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So they left us pretty much alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And then we weren’t there all that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And then when they were told, they’re going to take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , it was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We wouldn’t go onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because they were absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And here we were, in spite of getting regular <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , pretty filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We only had one set of clothes and shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I’m sure we had shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I had a woman’s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But they weren’t even able to fit, not small enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They insisted we get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and don’t worry about getting them dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets were. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Couldn’t believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But anyway they took us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and they put us in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Holland</span> , where the Dutch then sorted things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And you had to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay before they’d send you back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And that was taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  While you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did you witness anybody, any of the former prisoners taking revenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Well, I suppose if you would have known somebody or run into somebody that you knew had been a, recognized a prison guard, I don’t think he would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But that would have been such a chance encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Well, for one thing we were wearing what looked like American Army uniforms because that’s the only clothing, I guess, that we were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I’m not sure what else the Red Cross had that they gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide berth. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Because they didn’t have anything to do anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Things were pretty chaotic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  Do you recall how you felt at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Angry or happy or any hopes? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">12
ANSWER:  Hopeful is probably the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">No, I don’t think anger set in until later. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">At that point you’re just trying to revive, was probably the closest word to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You’re still fairly weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You’re beginning to get a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You can eat a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Beginning to feel a little better all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And at this point you’re just trying to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You’re really not thinking about the future, what you want to do, or what you have to do or what you’re going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You’re still preoccupied with eating, primarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  And getting enough to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  And getting, yeah, yeah, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  What about your, when you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and just adjusting to daily life again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Well, initially of course, I think we were all spread out. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I stayed with one family who was a friend of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">My brother stayed with a friend of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">His closest friend was an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">His father was the distributor for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> of RKO, the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I think he stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And my parents stayed with, I don’t even remember who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So we were in different <span class="NPIP">locations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We weren’t really, and this was like, talking the summer of ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">There really wasn’t much going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Trying to see about getting back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">My <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class had graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I think we may have actually been back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn’t give me my diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Hadn’t been there in four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Four out of six wasn’t good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the Fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I think, somebody... the Dutch did things fairly reasonably. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The person that was living in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had gotten there in good faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He did not know, or they did not know that was the property or the residence of deported Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And so what they did, if the person had something in good faith, so you don’t have, just transfer the victim from one person to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They could stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So my parents found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I don’t know where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether they had given some of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> to somebody to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But anyway we ultimately had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We had a tutor trying to get us up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn’t measure up, that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Well that’s the deal they made with my parents, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Apparently I did all right because... and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It’s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven’t had trigonometry. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, trying to catch up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what you had been through? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Was that a challenge at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppose so because that’s the only thing we did, was to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and you may have had to stay after <span class="BUILDING">class</span> for additional instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And depending on—I’m not sure whether you’re familiar with the European system—it’s not ten minutes worth of homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You spent every night doing homework, and 13 we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturdays half a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for ten minutes before dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Or if we happened to get done by eight o’clock, the homework, we could play for a half hour before going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except maybe for the weekends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  So you didn’t, you weren’t necessarily ever... was there a point were you remember you started really reflecting on what had happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It really would have been pointless anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The Dutch had been exceedingly helpful, and trying to shield people. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And not personally, but from others that they tried to hide an awful lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">The population as a whole, with minor exceptions, had always been very supportive. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And now you're back after the war and you’re no longer wearing the star, you’re no longer distinguishable from the rest of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And so there was no need for anybody to either bend over backwards or kick you in the shins. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So, no, I don’t think, as a matter of fact, I really haven’t dwelled on it much all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust survivor and I always detested that. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It was one of those things that happened, nothing you can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I’m not ashamed of it certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I’m not proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I mean, nothing you can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I suppose like most unpleasant things, you try and put them out of your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  This maybe is kind of a digression, going out of the chronology, but was there a point where you really felt compelled personally to talk about your experiences to anyone? </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Like that would help you or help other people to...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  No, never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I’ve never been much for psychologists. (</span><span class="sentence" id="539">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="540">No, I never, and I suppose a lot of the reason I don’t remember a lot of things because they’re probably suppressed memory, and why bring it up? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">What purpose does it serve? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I know a friend of mine keeps after me to try and write a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I don’t, I say absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">One, there’s not enough to fill a page, but aside from that, no, I don’t... matter of fact, there’s somebody come from the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> this month. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Did you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  I heard something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  I think it’s, Goldfarb, is that his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Marvin, Martin Goldfarb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Yeah, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It 1s Goldfarb, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  I’m pretty sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I’m blanking on his name right now, but I know him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">That’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Okay, that’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I got invitation, I don’t know where it came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was an invitation to the Holocaust survivors in the second generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And I was debating whether to go or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Because one thing, I don’t know any of them that are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I’m not so sure whether I care to or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I haven’t made up my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I may decide on the last minute whether I will or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">14
QUESTION:  Okay, we have another minute or so on this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Well, that’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Your brother has, it sounds like, taken kind of an active role in something that’s related to being a Holocaust SUIVIVOT.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And that came about because he saw an article in a paper about the Anne Frank Foundation and somebody’s name who was, I guess the Chairman of the Board, who lived near where he lived in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And he had never heard of the man before and he called him to meet him, just out of curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And apparently they got friendly and he got him involved in the Anne Frank Foundation and he’s on the Board of Directors now, has been for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And he goes around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> every so often making speeches and fundraising and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I’m not sure whether he knew, because looking at his tape, I’m not sure whether he mentioned the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that we went to or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Anyway I don’t remember what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But it was obviously the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that Anne Frank went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">The only thing I remember about that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is we made honey in the Fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They had bee hives on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I was thinking about that earlier, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Whenever it was ready we would go upstairs and they would take the hives, the honeycombs out and put them in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">centrifuge</span> and we made honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I guess carved up the combs and sold it with the wax and the honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">That’s about the only thing I remember. (</span><span class="sentence" id="580">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="581">There was something else, too, animal-related about that <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Can’t think of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Let’s go ahead and change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">End of Tape 1, Side B 15 Tape 2, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side A. And would you say a little bit more about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I was wondering about, continuing in this same vein of digression, I was wondering about your feeling as a Holocaust survivor, whether you feel that there’s any benefit to be derived from identifying yourself that way? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">With the work that your brother... (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) ...it’s a strange way of putting the question, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  No, I tell you reason I am laughing 1s I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But no, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I’ve never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I normally don’t as a matter of conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and there was a couple in that group that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He had worked for General Motors and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , across in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And they had invited a friend of theirs from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come down and join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">We were on the trip up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Granada</span> to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alhambra</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And on the way back we were sitting at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and this man came wandering in by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I said to him in German, “How are you doing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He complained, “Not very well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He didn’t speak English, and so unless his friends were around... blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then on a stop on the way back, we were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> together and he said, “How come you speak German so well?” </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I was debating what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I just said, “I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And I totally devastated that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And that evening he sought me out in the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and came to apologize. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I said, “Hey, it’s not your fault, you were too young.” </span><span class="sentence" id="605">This man was in his fifties, he may have been a child at the time. “</span><span class="sentence" id="606">Oh, please come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ,” he would host us, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So I’m always very careful because there’s no need to upset people that have no, you know, no responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I’m not looking for an advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So no, I rarely volunteer the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  What about, you’re doing this interview today. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You did one other interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">What has made you agree to do those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Well, it’s the neo-Nazism that says it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I think there needs to be as much evidence as possible to show that it really did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And that those many of us who survived are perfectly normal people. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Or what passes for normal, at least I think so. (</span><span class="sentence" id="617">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And don’t all go around looking, “Hey, you owe me a favor because I survived.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But it’s not a bias free society. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Until whatever it is, say five years ago... I’ve been wanting to go and visit my grandparent’s <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I just couldn’t bring myself the thought of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">One, because it’s <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ; and two, that I wasn’t sure whether I could control my temper if somebody were to say something to me that would set me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And so we decided on a trial and that was we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for a week with day trips out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucerne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And the first trip was to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was the safe haven. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And then another day for a couple of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And it went all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I didn’t feel particularly bad or tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But on that boat trip, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> it got to me suddenly, and I had to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top deck</span> , to make sure we passed that <span class="DLF">border</span> back into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Because I just got obsessed all of a sudden, panicky. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And haven’t been back since. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">16
QUESTION:  What about your children? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Have you... people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you feel like it’s important to you to leave them some kind of information or some kind of knowledge about your life and your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  Well, they know about it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">At least one daughter, I think has... no, I think they all have copies of the tape of the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The tape that one of my... it’s really my father’s cousin that was much more informative than mine or, for that matter, my brother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">This fellow got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The Swedes took him out, sent him to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He was in a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish hospital</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But he decided to use that year to write down everything he could remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And then spend the rest of his life filling in the details that he didn’t remember, and try and get the... and he wrote a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The original was published in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And I never did get a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I'll have to ask my cousin for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">But I got a copy of his tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But he remembers names and dates and... and he went from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no idea about and really, don’t really care. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no relation to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">My youngest daughter couldn’t, when I said something to her about the Vietnam War, she says, “But Dad I was only six then.” </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You know, so it’s all ancient history. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Just like World War One is ancient history to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I’m a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bosporus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That’s a World War One site. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The British took one hell of a beating there. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">That was Churchill’s doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> , wanted to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But no, they’re not really interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Did you intentionally at some point start telling your children about...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  ...your history? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It just kind of gradually...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">My wife may have told them something or my mother may have. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It may have come out, a comment here or there or something that occurred that made me bring it up or a program that I watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Spielberg had a program, was it last week or week before last, it was on HBO. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I was going to tape it, but I don’t have HBO. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">When there’s something on the Holocaust I usually tape it. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">More for my information than to show others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  And I’m curious about what you mentioned a little earlier about someone who you know who’s a professional Holocaust survivor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  That was my cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  Your cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Well, my father’s cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  And is that something... and you mentioned that it bothers you. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Can you say more about what bothers you about that or what you think the danger of that 1s? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">17
ANSWER:  Oh, I don’t think there’s danger in it, it may bore people to death, but you can do that with other things, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">That was the singular defining incident of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And everything is being related to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I... that may have been the most important event in my life, even though I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I think there are much more important things, I mean it’s part of my history. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I was fortunate that I survived it, and I moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I don’t particularly dwell on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Or try and say, “Now wait a minute, I married that woman because I didn’t see that woman...” or you know, and relate it to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It has nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Well, in his case everything was. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">It came up in every conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  And have you had the experience as somebody who has survived the Holocaust, of people maybe assuming that because you are a Holocaust survivor that was the defining event of your life and therefore kind of maybe not seeing you clearly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  No, because I doubt whether anybody that would know me or that I would know, would find out that I am a Holocaust survivor until they really have known me for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Because it’s, see I don’t normally bring it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Not unless something happens to make it pop up for some reason or another, inadvertently, but no, I wouldn’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They just see the lack of hair. (</span><span class="sentence" id="693">Laughing. )</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  Is being Jewish important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  Yeah, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I am the only Jew in my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  Yes. (</span><span class="sentence" id="699">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I am proud of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  So, what does that mean to you, to be the only Jew in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">My wife is Episcopalian. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Our children were baptized in the <span class="BUILDING">Episcopalian church</span> , but are not particularly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">My youngest daughter was married in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> and now her children were just baptized in the last month, because they want... the older one now is going to first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And with the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> in such a mess, they want to put the boy into <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And they belong to a <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> and apparently they are now going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> regularly, which 1s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I have no problem with it one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Our oldest daughter was married for the first time in the <span class="BUILDING">Episcopal cathedral</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , which as you may know is so orthodox that the mass was in Latin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  They don’t even do that in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  I know. (</span><span class="sentence" id="712">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="713">That marriage didn’t last and her current husband is a Baptist. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I’m not sure that they are going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but their son goes to <span class="BUILDING">Bible school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He was in, going to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , not this Fall, but he was in a <span class="BUILDING">Baptist kindergarten</span> and <span class="BUILDING">preschool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And the other one doesn’t have any children and as far as I know, they were married by a minister who was, whom they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So that’s why I’m saying that. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">18
QUESTION:  So, what does it mean to you, can you say what it means to you to be Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">No more so than what it means being a chemist or of German extraction or married or grandfather or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">You better not say anything anti-Semitic or Ill blow your head off. (</span><span class="sentence" id="722">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But other than that, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  It doesn’t necessarily mean keeping certain traditions or going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Not really, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Keep certain traditions, but I... bit of a pragmatist, and I’m not all that tradition-bound. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I think the dietary laws make good sense from a health perspective, but I don’t particularly find the need to avoid eating shrimp.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  What about, do you think of Judaism as a... when you say it’s important to you to be Jewish, is it as a religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Well it’s really more ethnic than a religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Did you by chance see that program on trying to find the lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Fascinating program. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">To some people being Jewish is a religion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr. is probably the... Elizabeth Taylor. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But to... I would think most Jews, it’s more ethnic than religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You can’t help whatever your racial or ethnic background is. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I’m not hiding it and I’m not flaunting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So, I don’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">You know, whether somebody knows or doesn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It’s not that I don’t care personally, what I mean is I’m not concerned about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  So you’re not a particularly religious person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  No, I’m not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Let’s go pick up the timeline again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  We left off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> just after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">You’re going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you’re working hard at being a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And as far as, you were talking about being hopeful at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">What were you, do you recall what you were hopeful for, what you really wanted for the rest of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Well, initially to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you know, trying to pass the exams or get far enough along that I would be allowed to take the exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And then once they decided that I could, then of course sweating like everybody else to pass them. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I wanted to become a chemist or a chemical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And after I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Technical Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> for one year, ‘46, ‘47, to study chemical engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Then much to my dismay, my parents decided to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I didn’t want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Well for one thing, you had to leave your friends, just getting into the swing of things having done my freshman year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But they didn’t give me a choice, and so then of course the logical thing was... a lot of my mother’s family and some of my dad’s family were over here, had been over here for years, so we came over here in ‘47, Memorial Day, ‘47. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">19
QUESTION:  Did you consider not coming and staying? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">By then you were an adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Not coming, I said, I wasn’t given that option. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I said, “Okay, Ill go with you, but I’m going to go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="761">You get used to... it’s a changed situation, and I probably didn’t really give it much serious thought after some months or some years to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Did you have any... what were your notions about the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  Well, you know the only notions you have are the cowboys, and the skyscrapers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And since it was Memorial Day when we got here, the night before traveling along the South shore of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> you saw the fireworks. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Of course, you didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Memorial Day didn’t mean anything to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Then it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I’m not sure if it was hot for Memorial Day, but like it is right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It was one of these early hot spells. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Our, my mother’s brothers came and picked us up, met us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and took us over to my mother’s sister’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  Where was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">My mother was one of 13 brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And one, two, three... four sisters were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and three of her brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And the three, three sisters and the three brothers lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And my dad’s sister, I think she may still have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And matter of fact, they had written, my mother’s brothers had gotten an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for us, which was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from one and next- door to one of the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And so we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I guess, but I’m not sure, we stayed with my aunt for a while until our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> arrived, because I’m not sure it was on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I don’t remember, it’s been a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  So, you came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Oh Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">The Veyndam (ph) was the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  Dutch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  It was a Holland-America Line <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> built in 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I looked it up recently, that’s why I can spout that stuff. (</span><span class="sentence" id="791">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was requisitioned during World War Two and was used as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And then this was the last trip across the Atlantic to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to be reconverted, to have all of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and all that stuff taken out and be converted back to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> and was retired in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I couldn’t remember the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I looked it up in the New York Times a year or two ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They had the comings and goings of all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and they listed them in the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Listed as May 30", Memorial, May 30" with 112 passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  You remember anything about the journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Oh yes. (</span><span class="sentence" id="800">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="801">The... I’m not sure how many, 20 or so people could live in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabins</span> and my parents had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Most of us were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> and like all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span> , you know, seven stacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And we used the bottom one or the second bottom one, there was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">20 And it was pretty good until the weather got rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">We really got tossed around and that day that we got tossed around the dinner was bacon and beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I just stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But one fellow, he was a big eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">He never missed a meal and he came charging down the steps, threw his teeth on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and ran back up and fed the fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Then he came back, got his teeth, and went back to eat the second time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="810">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="811">That’s about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">It was a long trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">It was 14 days, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But that’s all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">It was unremarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Hampton</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> , which was the Holland-American Line terminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="817"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> had been closed about a month or two earlier, so we didn’t come through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Hot, hot and dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Of course the high rise, and the frantic activity, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> going everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">QUESTION:  How was your English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  Non-existent or very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Well, I had <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> English. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But didn’t have much choice, had to learn in a hurry, because I got a job within a week as a lab technician at <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Paid the glorious wage of 100 dollars a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And we had to work half day Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And then we took, had to take... we didn’t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That paid an extra six dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And the girls all were more interested in going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> , so I took all of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And then I got a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Two weeks in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I got a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">That was Saturday morning, going to work, I was going down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and a cop stopped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I didn’t know what he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I didn’t understand enough of what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on the immigration stamp to show him I don’t, you know it was two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I did understand what identification was. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport back and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Well the only meaning of the word ticket I knew was admission to a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Didn’t want to, don’t have time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Tried to explain... finally made me take it, he told me I didn’t have to go myself, I could give it to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He said what for? (</span><span class="sentence" id="843">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I told him I didn’t know, but a cop had given it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So he explained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the end of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I guess I looked like a good sucker for one. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And when I became a citizen you have to list all non- moving traffic violations excepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So I went back to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to find out what the heck I had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Whatever it was, violation of city code something or other, disposition, two dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Fine of two dollars, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But it’s on my records.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  It’s not on your records as having, the infraction was not listed on your records?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  No, I had to list it on my citizenship application.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">QUESTION:  I mean the cause of the ticket being given.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Oh it listed whatever it was, the code violation, but I have no idea what it was that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">You know, hopscotch down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , who knows what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">The reason you had 21 to be so careful... in the ‘30s and ‘40s, well prior to let’s say the ‘50s and ‘60s, anti-Semitism was an acceptable feeling in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And the State Department was so strongly anti- Semitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and rescue as many and let them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And the Immigration Service didn’t help matters either. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">An uncle of mine when he went for his hearing was asked for his convictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">He said he didn’t have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">The judge says, “Think it over and come back in six months.” </span><span class="sentence" id="862">This went on twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">You know, what the hell are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Well, it turned out that there was somebody with the same name, apparently, who had gotten a parking ticket in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they accused him of lying because he didn’t list it. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And he said, “I don’t even know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> is and I don’t have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So they finally... but his citizenship was delayed for a year over something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  And you think it was because he was Jewish that they...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">There wasn’t any... they put a lot of barriers in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Of course then too, you know, the rules were a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">You had to be a resident for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">You had to demonstrate your fluency in English, not like today where they’ Il give it to you in Spanish or French or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And lastly you had to demonstrate a knowledge of American history. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And the Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Who was the 23" president? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">They asked my dad to name the 13 original <span class="REGION">colonies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And he got as far as one or two, I remember, and the judge said, “Guess I asked the wrong person, you tell me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Well, I started out with <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> going up the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , because I could never remember whether it’s <span class="REGION">Maine</span> or <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="880">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And he stopped me when I got to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So I got off easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I got at least 12 of the 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And he asked me, I still don’t know why that was the wrong answer, he asked me, “Why do we celebrate the Fourth of July?” </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I said, “Because it’s Independence Day.” </span><span class="sentence" id="886">That wasn’t the right answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I’m not sure what it was supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">But they were pretty strict and... depending on the judge, most of those were not all that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">But there was... well <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dupont</span> did not hire its first Jew until World War Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in ‘54, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn’t hire Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It was that pervasive still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  When was your citizenship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  ‘52. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Matter of fact, my brother couldn’t become a citizen because he was not in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">You had to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He was in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">He had been drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He couldn’t become a citizen because he was not in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is tape two, side B.
ANSWER:  Well in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> there really was very little that you could or couldn’t do as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But being ignorant as to the American way, I asked a girl in one of my classes at <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> for a date and she turned me down flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">She was Italian and I was Jewish and it just didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I applied for admission to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and RPI, Rensselaer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectady</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And I was turned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">In one instance, the Dutch quota was filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">You know, all kinds of barriers that existed that you ran into either unwittingly or stupidly, whichever, for me mostly unwittingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Natives would have known better and would have avoided the... either embarrassment or whatever you want to call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  What were your parents doing once they arrived here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  My... you were, you had to come with a job offer and the company that my dad had worked for in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the thirties had a... what was then a <span class="BUILDING">branch</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which then or now was of course was the only <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And they had offered him a job there and so he went to work there the second day we were here or after the first week we were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I had gotten the job at <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">My brother got a job somewhere, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And so everybody worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  And you all shared an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  Yes, we lived with my parents and since we were... I’ve been thinking about that, and of course, never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But we were expected to contribute to the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And I’m not sure whether that was a matter of need or a matter of discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">That you live here, you gotta pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Earn money, your share, which was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Once in the Fall, I started at night at the City College of New York, went to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> and worked during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Did that all the way through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  How did you end up feeling about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You hadn’t been happy to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Did you end up feeling, at some point feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, very quickly, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I don’t want you to think that I was paranoid about these <span class="DLF">barriers</span> that you ran into. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">It was just ignorance, you learn from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">One of my uncles took me aside and gave me the facts of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">That there are some things that Jews can’t do in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .

<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  No, frankly, no, no, I really never thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">There are some things that you... I guess it really wasn’t very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">They were minor inconveniences. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">It wasn’t any big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I can’t complain about that.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Trying to get better jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Getting paid more. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And then I, of course, the Korean War started and I had to go for my physical. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I was classified 1-A to begin with before I ever took the physical. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And then trying to get a student deferment. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I had a very nasty Draft Board that made all kinds of unpleasant remarks when I went for a hearing for a student deferment, about “What’s the matter, don’t you want to shoot some Chinks?” </span><span class="sentence" id="959">You know, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I graduated in January of ‘51. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And went on to <span class="BUILDING">Graduate school</span> , and they just gave me fits all the way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">They would re-classify me 1-A, had to appeal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Then they would get it back to a student deferment for six months, but retroactive to a date of... so half the time I was deferred, half the time I wasn’t, which was a real distraction while in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">But I made it through all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Didn’t even think about it, I went to work for <span class="BUILDING">Shell Oil Company</span> and that was deferrable employment because of the oil industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Of course the war was pretty well over by that time anyway, ‘54.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Would you have felt willing to go and fight in the Korean War if you hadn’t been involved in this student... or what were your feelings behind that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Not very happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I wasn’t even a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">As a matter of fact, my brother, who was drafted, he did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he was actually sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And when this citizenship hearing came up, he couldn’t, because he was overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I mean, that’s the most preposterous thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">He was in the U.S. Army therefore he couldn’t become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But not particularly happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Wasted enough time in my life already without having to serve a few more years in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">But no, I wasn’t particularly, I was not unwilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I mean, I wasn’t going to refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">But I wasn’t going to volunteer either.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  No, oh no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They uh, no, certainly not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">They, well as I mentioned, my mother is one of thirteen children, two of them were killed in World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Of the remaining eleven, three brothers were here and four sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht thing in ‘38 and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he wouldn’t die in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so they could count him as having released him, rather than having him die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And he died at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And they decided they better get their son out before he’s going to get it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But my mother’s sister-in-law with her daughter stayed and they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And another sister and her husband had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in the early ‘30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He was a very prosperous furniture manufacturer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">They had two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And they actually helped one of the other sisters’ children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as °42, by way of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and through <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">They stayed for a while with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But that couple with their children, the sister, they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">As a matter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And then on my father’s side, my grandmother, my dad’s mother, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn’t have walked from here to the <span class="DLF">front door</span> without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ride to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And one of, his sister was here, but his brother was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And so no, we, and fortunately for my mother’s, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, she died in late ‘44, so she never did find out what happened to her children, those that were in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">My... the son that was sent over, he went back to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> looking for his parents or for his mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">He was in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Some of my other cousins that were in the Army went looking for the relatives and for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Of course once we got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , my parents, my mother contacted her sisters, and let them know that we had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Of course, they also asked to see if we could find out from there what happened to the other relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And there’s the extended family as I mentioned, my dad’s cousin, his parents did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">25
QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">ANSWER:  Robertson, he... (Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I’m laughing because you ask about the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">His name was Rosenberg also and when he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> a man came in, a British Army officer and said to him, “Are you Hans Rosenberg?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He said, “I’m Peter Robertson, your brother.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He had been sent out and was drafted in the British Army and they wouldn’t allow the name Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Because in the event of he would be captured by the Germans that they wouldn’t... he wanted to just anglicize 1t and make it Montrose, but there’s a Lord Montrose and you’re not allowed to use the name of a famous person, so they made it Robertson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And so then when he came over here and became a citizen he decided so he would have the same name as his brother he changed his name to Robertson.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">QUESTION:  What was his first name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  Henry, Hans.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  So, most of your family’s conversation then, when you were talking about wartime issues was concerned with what had become of various family members and tracking people down and making...
ANSWER:  Family members, to some extent, property, the carpet which is in our <span class="INT_SPACE">family room</span> used to belong to my parents and then of course, the Germans got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And my dad was, sometime, I’m not sure when, in the fifties, he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on business and he saw it hanging in a <span class="BUILDING">carpet store</span> in the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And he went in and said, “That’s my carpet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Fellow says, “Tough luck, it cost you so much,” whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">He took a picture of it, but 1t didn’t do any good, because as I said earlier, the Dutch didn’t want to transfer the victim from one to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But they ended up buying it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And then I got it after my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">There are other things that come up occasionally or would come up about something that was missing, or wondering where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I had a fairly nice stamp collection that I had given to a friend for safekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And all the valuable stamps are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">You know, you can be harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on the other hand, they may have traded it for food and needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">They didn’t know whether you were going to come back or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">The only one that was absolutely and scrupulously honest was the concierge of the business where my dad worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He had everything that my dad entrusted to him and gave every bit of it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Where many of your so-called friends denied they ever had anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And there’s one thing that’s unfortunate and I didn’t know about it until fairly recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Apparently my mother had written a long letter to one of her sisters, or maybe to all of them, same letter addressed to all of them, about the deprivation, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">She said her ambition was to die in her own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> between clean sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And that letter wasn’t discovered until one of my cousins, one of the sister’s daughters, who lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> , but was moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and was going through the stuff to throw things away and came across that letter and gave it to... I think there may be one or two pages missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">But it was not until a year or so, two years after my mother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And that explained a lot of things to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">But fortunately we 26 were able to do that unknowingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">She died at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in her own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">It was difficult to do it that way, but...
QUESTION:  From where had she written the letter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">ANSWER:  From <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> after the war, she had wrote that to her sisters, describing what had happened to some extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">She wrote in there, “I wasn’t going to give those bastards the pleasure of throwing me into a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I want to die in my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> between clean sheets.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Probably one of the reasons for our survival was my mother’s strong will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I think that had a lot to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Probably didn’t realize it at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  More so than your father’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Or your father was more of a...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yes definitely, and still am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I mean there aren’t that many of us left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">But I talk to some of my cousins on a fairly regular basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We don’t see each other all that often because we’re now scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">A few years ago in Spring we decided to make a round-trip to Florida and visit Alice’s brother and then take a few days on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and then went to visit some of my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">When everybody lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , when all they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I would see them whenever I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> once a year, but now they’re scattering too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Retiring and dying, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Not all of us are alive anymore in our generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  When you met your wife, did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Did you talk about that during your courtship at all?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">QUESTION:  And did that become a, later, as you recall, a topic...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  That never became an issue, no, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">No, it would have to have only become a topic of conversation... well it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I had back problems, it’s now, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">30-some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And when I asked the surgeon what, was there any indication what the cause was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And he said, without knowing what my background was, he says, “Yeah, severe malnutrition during your growing years.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But other than that, normally it was not a topic of...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, she knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I’m sure my mother told her probably a number of things, and occasionally... well, she’s seen the videos also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">All the kids have seen them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I’m pretty sure, I may even have made copies for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They’re aware of it, but it’s just a piece of history, not “the”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">A lot of difference there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">QUESTION:  So, what happened after you got married? </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Did you move?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  Yeah, we... a bit hectic few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I had my Ph.D. orals on Thursday and a final in a class on Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">We got married on Tuesday and we left during that, after the wedding and went around the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , where I had to report for work a little less than two weeks later.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Shell? </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Well, it was a particular development scheme, you took one step forward and maybe two backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It just got to be a bore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And I asked for a different assignment and they said, “No, no, you’re doing too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">You’re getting where we want you to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And I didn’t want to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And so I started to look for something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And the most interesting job that I was being considered for was with the Navy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But the chief of that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was on a year’s sabbatical in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and they weren’t going to make a decision until he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And I wasn’t going to wait another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And the assignment that they talked to me about in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> was pretty interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And I had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">It was nerve-racking, because I didn’t realize it at the time, it was ACE, the Atomic Energy Commission was the primary contractor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And so it was at the whims of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And two years after I was up there we went overnight from three thousand to three hundred employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I finally decided this is getting too much, these ups and downs, and mostly downs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And there was another one coming, so I decided to look around the company for other possible opportunities and they happened to have an opening down here, so I applied for it and got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  This is still for GE?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">ANSWER:  Well... (Laughing) funny, because we talked about it yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">While we were still living in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Riverfront Stadium</span> was the big issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">It was being built, where to build it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They started construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And they said when they got done with that they were going to build the biggest <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">They were going to put a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So, that answers that question, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">No, not really, didn’t know much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I was commuting for about six weeks, no, longer than that, two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And so got acquainted a little bit with the <span class="REGION">area</span> while I was still living up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And there wasn’t that much difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">People are people everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And a pretty nice group of people here that I worked with and worked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Matter of fact, ’'m still friends with, fairly good friends with one of my former bosses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And I’m particularly happy about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">ANSWER:  No, not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Now I’m on every Jewish organization’s mailing list.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">ANSWER:  There was an article in the Courier Journal, maybe a year ago, whenever it was, about the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and how the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> needed expansion and they were going to have a quiet campaign for construction funds, for building funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">So, I sent them a check with a note attached that “Since you’re having a quiet campaign I’m sending you a check on the QT.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And got a very nice letter back, as a matter of fact, a friend of mine who is quite involved with the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , the lady showed him the letter not knowing that we knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">But that got me on the mailing list for every Jewish organization locally, of course mostly asking for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">QUESTION:  And you mentioned a little bit earlier about how you don’t really have contact with other Holocaust survivors in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And you’re not sure you want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">ANSWER:  Not on that basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I mean, I’m not saying that I say, “You’re a Holocaust survivor, move aside, I don’t want a part of it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">What I’m saying is, if I happen to meet somebody who also is, I have no problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">That’s just... End of Tape 2, Side B 30 Tape 3, Side A
QUESTION:  Okay, this is tape number three, side A of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">You were just saying about the Holocaust survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Did you want to add anything else to what you had said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">ANSWER:  No not really, as I say, ’'m debating on whether to go to this meeting just out of curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">See, I don’t think I know anybody... well, I’m pretty sure I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I’m sure they have to be all older folks. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">SoI may. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I haven’t decided yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But no, no special interest as a criterion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  How about other, just looking back over your years here after the war in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Were you really mainly just focusing on your work and your family or did you have other interests or passions outside of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I have a number of hobbies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">For one thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And gardening, although my <span class="DLF">garden</span> right now doesn’t show that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And I always like to travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn’t always possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So we made up for it since I retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Now I have time to watch television and the History channel and A&E and of course, KET to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So that... a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">I don’t go for these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Caribbean cruises</span> , you know, “Show me, feed me, entertain me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruises</span> because they are a lazy man’s way of traveling—you only pack and unpack once—but there has to be a reason for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And sometimes they are real eye-openers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">A couple of years we went on an <span class="REGION">Eastern Mediterranean</span> and Black Sea cruise and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanta</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , which is the major port of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> on the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Ovid was exiled there for seven years or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Well, never even thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> , <span class="REGION">east coast</span> of the <span class="REGION">Balkan Peninsula</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And that they had gone that far North into what is now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> and to the Crimea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I’m sure it’s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical event, just didn’t think about that or heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">A lot of things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But as we talked earlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">The other day there was a fascinating program on the Vikings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">They were the kings of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">They went east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Nobody... I never heard that before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">QUESTION:  What about Holocaust-era history? </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Have you done much reading about that or taken an interest in finding out what happened on a broader scale?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">There is a lot... new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">The... well of course, in addition to Spielberg’s movie, I’m not sure what the show was the other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with certain aspects of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">But then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about 31 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> , and I have never seen it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government circles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau’s employees went to him and said, “You go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we’re going to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn’t doing anything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And as a consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons, to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would have, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And they put them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Well, you know, you signed this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">But a number of couples had had children here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">They were born at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were entitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">The State Department declared <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> was not <span class="REGION">American soil</span> and therefore they were not American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Can you imagine a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared not being a part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I mean that’s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately, our government went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">I guess too many toes were being stepped on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">But... and of course, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , but I couldn’t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that one vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Another black mark in our history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">QUESTION:  So, it was too painful to be going through and reminded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">ANSWER:  Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred passengers and I don’t think two dozen survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">It’s incredible that the things that the U.S. government could have done, should have done and never did do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">It’s that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1258">QUESTION:  Related to that, I’m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">How do you reconcile those two?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">ANSWER:  Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">Maybe because the government should and isn’t, that you’re overcoming the shortcomings of our government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Even though I don’t take that into consideration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that’s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I’m sure the same thing holds true for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Whether it’s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , and dish out food for people in need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">Or 32 I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And they’re desperate for volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Obviously: they asked me to help. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">But the thing 1s, that is one way that you can give back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And whether it’s in your own expertise or if it’s just plain labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or drive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at <span class="BUILDING">Kroger</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">But that’s the kind of jobs that need to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And that’s the kind of things that makes many of these non-profit organizations click. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some four or five years ago, for his reasons felt that the public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And I completely agree with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">But that doesn’t mean that today they give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it’s zilch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Cut it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">I work for the <span class="BUILDING">public radio stations</span> here as a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And they used that withdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous, the biggest drive they ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And rightly so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I’m a firm believer in putting the public back into public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to make financial donations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And that’s just one, that’s not nearly as, I suppose, important as helping somebody who’s hungry or reading for the blind, but it’s one of the large variety of volunteer jobs that needs to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">It’s amazing, I don’t do that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I’m not trying to pat myself on the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually works for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the year, he and his wife, jointly, this past year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Between the two of them they put in three thousand hours a year, that’s a hell of a lot of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">That’s almost a fulltime job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">If we could get half the people to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it would be a lot of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And that’s what I mean by that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">QUESTION:  Have you traveled much within <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  Not that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I mean we’ve been all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Been both west and east, and south. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Essentially covered the whole <span class="REGION">state</span> more or less, but not extensively.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">QUESTION:  Does the culture or the history of the state interest you particularly or are you more kind of limited...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">ANSWER:  Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> versus the rest of <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , seems to be diminishing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">But that is, you know the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> versus the rest of the <span class="REGION">state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Look at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> and you know, you can go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">I think it’s probably true of most <span class="REGION">states</span> that the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> are thought to be representative and they’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Even though they contain most of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And I can understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And the interests of <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> in particularly are so diverse, from <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span> with its problems, and <span class="REGION">Western Kentucky</span> with some of the same problems and some totally different problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , of course, for painfully obvious reasons having totally different problems that people in <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span> couldn’t care less about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">But that’s true everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And it’s amazing, the thing that I thought that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was unique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">They’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">It’s the same everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">It doesn’t matter what <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">But we were in <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Well, the mere fact that they have a 33 Royal Commission on Race Relations says there’s a problem there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And it’s the Maoris, which are no longer in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> it’s the indigenous people versus the settlers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And then of course among the settlers you get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Look right now, <span class="COUNTRY">Fiji</span> , the <span class="REGION">Solomon Islands</span> , the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324"><span class="REGION">Africa</span> is just a terrible situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  Were you... was that something that you were particularly aware of in your early years 1n the U.S., segregation, the Civil Rights Movement, any of those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">But in the early fifties, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durham</span> , the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durham</span> was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">Why I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">There’s a fairly good sized, there was a—there may still be—a good-sized Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durham</span> because of the tobacco industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Apparently they brought the Jews down in order to make cigars, like they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tampa</span> with the Cubans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And then, I still remember the man’s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">The little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> was two <span class="BUILDING">parishes</span> , a black and a white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Neither one of them could support a priest, and he ordered them integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Wasn’t... no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two <span class="BUILDING">parishes</span> in one <span class="BUILDING">church building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">It was unheard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Of course the press would claim race relations are only bad in the South. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Well, they’re probably a lot better in the South than they were elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Before I bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say “Hey, so that I don’t stub my toe, 1s there anyplace that I cannot go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Where I would be refused because I am Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And he said, “Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Don’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oak Forest</span> ,” or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Oaks</span> , whatever it was called, which I couldn’t anyway, that was the rich <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">But you learned to do those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">QUESTION:  Is there something else that I haven’t asked you about that you’d like to talk about today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">ANSWER:  No, I can’t really think of much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">I don’t know whether this gets perpetuated or not, but I certainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors, but all retirees to think about give something back to the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">QUESTION:  This is something that’s very important to you, 1t seems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I mean, you brought it up last time, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1351">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">There’s such a terrible need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And what makes me particularly, actually angry... I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time basis, because they don’t know what to do with themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They’re bored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">This is utterly ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">But there’s just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">It isn’t that it can’t be done without money, but it’s the personal help that’s required. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">And here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , we are blessed with a number of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">The Recordings for the Blind, the Audio Studio, and there’s a third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">There isn’t another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that does that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">We have three <span class="BUILDING">public radio stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">There is not, even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> only has one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">There are 34 a lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don’t brag about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , keep down the population influx. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">QUESTION:  So, you’re pretty much of a Louisville patriot, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">ANSWER:  We have it very good here in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , and particularly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , and of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> in many ways, much more dynamic than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> is, for one thing they’ve got the city-county government, which we won’t get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">It’s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it won’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">The race relations right now are just so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">All you have to do is look at other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and that’s not just... take this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here as an example, which you can buy similar <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here for depending on the condition and age, but let’s say 150 to 250. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silicon Valley</span> you couldn’t touch it for two and a half million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">In other <span class="REGION">areas</span> , yeah you may be able to get for less, but most <span class="REGION">areas</span> you can’t touch it for twice the amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of <span class="REGION">California</span> , sell their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and live happily ever after, because they can buy another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> somewhere else in <span class="REGION">Arizona</span> or in <span class="REGION">Florida</span> for a fraction of what it’s worth in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">Our food prices are reasonable, with the exception of gasoline in <span class="REGION">Jefferson County</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shelbyville</span> last night and paid 40 cents a gallon less than what it is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I mean that’s ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Could have gone as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Simpsonville</span> , that’s only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">But outside of these temporary distortions, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I used to get all my bread from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , now there’s a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> over on <span class="DLF">Taylorsville Road</span> that carries it and I can go get it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">We used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">We’re blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent bakeries and different bakeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">If you want a certain thing you get it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">How many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> can you say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">In 20 minutes I’m at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">QUESTION:  You feel welcome here, comfortable here as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1390">ANSWER:  Oh yes, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">That is not an issue at all in this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I’m sure there’s always, well like the Ku Klux Klan exists here, but you can ignore that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">No, I have never had anybody make a disparaging remark to me or denied me something because I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Until the present mayor, the Mayor of Louisville was Jewish, Jerry Abramson, one of the most popular mayors that the city of Louisville has had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I think he was in there for thirteen years, the longest that anybody ever has. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And he was quite, I mean it was not anything that was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">He was quite open about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">No, I don’t think there’s a problem at all here.</span></p>
