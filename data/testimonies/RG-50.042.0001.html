<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Wait, we have to stop, there's a noise.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Saw people with flowers and cameras, walking up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">You know, our <span class="DLF">street</span> was called Shishinska, which means uh, like uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , which was the <span class="DLF">street</span> which led to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> , and people were walking up that <span class="DLF">street</span> , and my mother said something like, "Oh my God, I hope they are not...," and at this point that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> came down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , was an incredible roar, came down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and was two German military in them, and uh, the thing which I remember most vividly, my brother had his wristwatch in his pocket, and he was just removing it from his pocket, and so, his hand must have trembled because his watch fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I remember seeing, it, it was 9:10 in the morning, and I was sort of thinking that something that, that was the moment when, when our world was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Tell me about the woman who wanted your Polish ---------.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Uh, well, we um, we realized that things were uh, what, what was most astonishing thing 1s that uh, we heard roars of uh people, our neighbors, and friends and people I've known all my life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother was born in the same <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was born, and you know, it's been in the family I don't know for how many generations, and, uh, uh people were shouting you know, "Heil Hitler! </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Long live the Fuehrer," and, and, and, and people were waving flags with Swastikas and uh, there was a feeling of complete betrayal, sud-suddenly you were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, and you were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You know, I mean, uh it was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you know, and we, we love <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was uh, uh at least a young generation, you know because the older generation had grown up, up under <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but of course, we were born under <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and uh, this is something I couldn't understand and, and probably uh the most, the most vivid example of that was that my friend Trudy, who uh had a ve-a very bitter life and her mother had died, and she had a stepfather, her mother married a, a that man went through, there was very little, he was terribly cruel to her, and he was beating her, and she spent so much time with us, was a, a, you know, and I, I really felt oh so close to her, and I saw her going to our <span class="DLF">garden</span> and picking white roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother was particularly proud of them because they had bloomed out of season and, and she was handing it to a sold--to a German soldier, you know, and people were bringing, and, and, and I think that gesture always sticks in my mind as, as one of complete betrayal, and also I remember her handing the roses to the soldier who is reaching out to her, and at that moment, someone else was handing him a glass of Schnapps, or what, you know, it was some sort of whiskey, and he let the roses fall to, to, to, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and people were trampling on my roses, and um, uh, I don't know tt, it's sort of like 1t became a symbol for me, that very moment, it's arrested in my mind that uh, what, what was happening there, that everything was sort of upside down, and um...I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Tell me about the neighbor who wanted -----------.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Then there was a woman, you know people, how people try to be helpful, I, I don't mean to uh, uh to say that um, that 1t was a direct betrayal of us, at that particular <span class="NPIP">point</span> it was not, but of...

<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  The war started in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">By, by Christmas we had to move to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was very cold and clammy. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We, we had no, no running water, no electricity, and uh, things were really quite bad, but we were still in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh, and spring was very difficult because I always loved my <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I used to spend a lot of time there as a child, and the sign appeared there, that dogs and Jews were not permitted to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Um, when we had orders to move to uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shabby</span> ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">a remote corner of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which became the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , uh, I defied that order. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I remember I, I said, "I don't care what they're going to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I had to see my <span class="DLF">garden</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Was a beautiful, fragrant spring morning, was in April, and uh, I remember I jumped over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and went to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and pretended that uh, that I was just, I was picking violets, and I pretended just for a little bit, what it would be like if uh, if the war hadn't happened, if I would be going in, my mother would say I, I need to take my raincoat to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my brother would be hurrying off, my father would be going to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , my mother would be setting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for breakfast, and urging us to -----------, and uh, I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um, uh the reality which I had always taken for granted, now became uh the most remote fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I then, I think it stayed with me you know, in a way, throughout all the years to, to return to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Later, of course, it took on other forms of um, when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , to imagining evening at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but here I still was looking at my <span class="BUILDING">childhood home</span> , <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my parents were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , my brother had been taken away, um, maybe six weeks after the war started, he was taken away October 19th, and the war broke out the first of September, but I was with my parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I could, I could see from the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which had been mine, the wallpaper, um, even though we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , I was still there, and, and yet um, I somehow must have been at least subconsciously aware that maybe I'm never come back, so I'd never recognize it, you know, I, I lived throughout with this thing, I'm going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , always, but uh, when I look back now over, over the many years, uh, and I, I still can very vividly recall my feeling, it, uh, 1t was sort of a farewell to, to my life and to my childhood, and I was sixteen at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , tell me about some of things you remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, you know, as much as I dreaded going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , um, actually in some ways, it was a little easier for me because my friends were there, you know, I was not as isolated as I had been at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time, and it was dangerous to go out anyway, but still we were uh, I was closer to my friends, so um, that somewhat compensated for, for the treatment so, so you know in, in, in every little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> another tragedy played. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Um, and then we had to work, um, and uh, in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badovitz</span> , they had the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> there, where they were sewing uniforms for, I guess for the army, and we were marched, my, my mother and IJ and all, all went. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Of course, you know, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were almost no men, there were mostly women and children, older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My father, uh, was one of the few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the, also in the nearby little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to fortify the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , 1n a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suhar</span> , and uh we were terribly worried every morning that might be daybreak, 4 or 5 0 clock that he'd left because he had a heart condition, and we were afraid what that hard labor will, will do to him, and uh, my mother and I and some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive, um had to go to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baravitz</span> to work 1n, in that uh, <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We left in the morning and came back late at night and then the whole thing started again, and actually I uh, I, I think the discipline was, was pretty good, you know you are so tired, you worked so hard that uh you did not get too much time to reflect of, of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">At least for me it was, I'm sure it was much more difficult for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, and then well, um, -----------------from 1939 uh till the worst day of my life, the 28th of June, 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Um, that is when I saw my father for the last time, the following day my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We were told to assemble. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, the day before um, we were, I uh, I heard my parents, of course, you know we all lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I heard my parents talk through that night, and I still cannot comprehend their incredible bravery. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They spoke only of, of their lives together, of their love, their good times, their children, their parents, and with that they faced the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I don't know, it sort of became uh, perhaps my own defense, I always felt, you know and thinks got-------------and volunteers??? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">that I had to emulate my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">If they could do it, I can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then I must, you know, never disappoint them, I knew that that if they return and, and I thought, those things are, these, I thought when they return, I will never will say, you know, I will, I will show them that I um, that I'll come back, I'll do everything to come back to them because I remember how, how horrible it was for them when my brother left. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Blessedly they never knew that my brother did not return. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But, you know, that was the daily conversation, when Arthur comes back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I felt that, you know, I owed it to them to, to stay alive, no matter what, and not give them the pain of that loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And however, you know we had, of course I always had a great --------------, so I was not particularly religious, I had a great deal of respect for religion and books, and um, one of the things I wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father, I wanted to I, I knew what would happen in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June, and um, I asked a friend of mine to go with me and collect uh prayer books, you know, I, I was afraid when they'll find it, they'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And we dragged, was a rainy day, and we dragged those books out to little <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which was adjacent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and an old uh <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , we took the books there, we, we couldn't really bury them, but we sort of stashed them on one of those where they were um, I, I guess were, were some cottons and things where apparently I, I don't remember that too well, but I know that this is how we first tried to bury some of them, and that sort of, you know, if it's a decency of, of, of a burial. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I would rather night recall the night the last night which I spent with my mother which was a very bitter, and then 1n the morning, you know, very, very early in the morning, uh, came the final moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Uh, when they rushed through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with their whips and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My poor mother, you know, my brother left on a Monday, and he left it 3 years prior to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And my mother fasted every Monday, sort of atoning, I don't know for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh, probably begging God if she's going to fast that my brother will return, and that was also on a Monday, and I, I remember I begged her to have something to eat and she wouldn't, but she had also uh, saved from before the war, a bit of cocoa, and uh, and some jam, and she decided to make that cocoa for me that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I remember it, she was looking at that cocoa with great longing, we didn't have any throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But, it didn't taste particularly sweet on that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We had to march through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and um, my...I guess it's a sort of a similar journey than a journey to execution when I think of it now because, you know, you saw people looking out from behind curtains. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Some waving sort of a mute farewell, uh, seeing uh somebody was painting a new sign on a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The movie was putting on a new feature on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">marquee</span> , and uh, and we were marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Ah. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Was an SS man there that turned, that was near the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> where the circus used to come, was sort of a an empty <span class="NPIP">place</span> , accommodating all kinds of things as a circus before, and now sort of a tragedy of ------------nature.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  If you could pick up, maybe you should tell me who Marin was and...
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I, I was with my mother, and a number of my friends, who were with their mothers, and um, we heard that Marin was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Um, Marin was um, a man of um, uh, if the stories to be believe of uh, not anyone to, to be greatly admired. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Um, a man apparently of a little character, what have you, he was called an opportunist, and uh, this opportunity was presented to him that he uh was, was working with uh, with the government there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The story also had that he uh he had a child, a little daughter whom apparently he adored, and that he would do anything in order to save that child, and um, the Nazis apparently gave him that opportunity that if he would be helpful to interpret or get people to come there, his child would be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That was the story, I don't know how, how much truth that was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But I saw him, he was a, a very small sort of sour-looking man and it was, it was raining but it was oppressively hot because it was the end of June, and he was wearing a sleek raincoat, and uh, and then of course there were the Germans in uniforms, the Nazis, the SS, he was standing to the side, we had to form a <span class="DLF">line</span> , and an SS man stood there with um, with a little stick and um, I was holding hands with my mother, I came up to him, and he says, "How old?" </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I said, "18," and he sort of pushed me to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and my mother to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I, I wasn't aware what was happening at that particular point, but shortly thereafter, when I stood with my other friends who were also separated from their mothers, we realized that we were going to go to separate <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There was <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> , an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> there, this barbed wire, to, to the right where our mothers were, and we were immediately taken to, to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Now again, I, I don't remember the time sequence at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I just remember a tremendous panic and uh, and shortly thereafter some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived, uh, open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with, with sort of a <span class="DLF">gate</span> behind it, and we were loading in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and uh, I heard my mother’s voice and I thought ask, "Where to?" </span><span class="sentence" id="113">and I shouted back, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And, I guess I must have been aware that that I was taken away from my mother so I jumped off, and Marin came, and he was very slight, small man, I didn't expect such strength in him, and he picked me up bodily and he threw me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he says, "You are too young to die." </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And, uh, I guess, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were set in motion, again, I tried, I don't remember the, the time sequence and uh, I just heard my mother's voice over the entire uh, over crying and everything, and it came like an echo and she was saying, you know, "Be strong," you know, "-------," in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> rolled out of there, and, ironically the, the sun came out sort of um, I still see it, the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span> looked wet, illuminated by the sun, and the church bells were ringing, and that was the last view. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We were taken to...were taken to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and of course, I was with my friends, and I think we, we all started talking and facing the reality what was probably happening, and I remember rejecting it completely, thinking it cannot be, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Uh, they're going to be all right, and frankly, that kept me going all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They have to be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnovitch</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, you see our part, it belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> before the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">This is why we were German-speaking, this was quite early, this was 1942 and 42, and um, and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> , your names, your ages, and the places you hail from were registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlitz</span> , which was a well-known <span class="BUILDING">textile center</span> , they called it the Manchester of <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> , and the people would come from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were in need of labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The men were in the army, the women were given responsible positions, and they needed slave labor, however they needed people who could understand German and speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So, we were in a ---------------position. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And a man came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kramstamatnaphronic</span> ???, </span><span class="sentence" id="127">which was a very large <span class="BUILDING">textile um center</span> I guess, or maybe many <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he bought us for that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to be slaves, and, but, in that --------------, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> , I think I came face to face for the first time with the concept of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , to which of course, slave labor concentration, we were because uh, shipments came with girls from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who were either named -------------, and that was um, the last stop before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I met those girls, and I remember my first contact was probably the first evening when we when we stood, um, in <span class="DLF">line</span> to get some food out of you know ---------aluminum bowls, you know, we used to feed our dogs out of bowls like that, and I didn't understand when that bowl was given to my hand, what to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And then we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> , and I got some food, and uh, I remember putting a spoon in and scraping because there was sand in the bottom, you know, and I saw this girl was you know, her hair was uh very short shorn hair, and she had enormous eyes, she was emaciated, and she looked sort of hungry, and I asked if she wanted it, and she looked at me as if I gave her the greatest treasure, and she said, "Yes," she said, "Aren't you hungry," and I said, "No," and she was sort of silhouetted against, uh, this <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and she sort of gave a benediction when, when she get it, and then she handed me an, an empty bowl and I, I didn't understand, and she said, "You know, if I, we found with two bowls, I'll be beaten that I stole it." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She gave me that that bowl, and that was sort of the first impact of things to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I uh was with a very close friend of mine, Ilsa, who was like a sister to me, we had grown up together, and a number of my other friends, and there I met people who became my best friend's family to each other, my friend Liesl, my friend, Susie. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">One was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and the other one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We became very close friends, and we were sent to camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkoreim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And um, strangely enough, on, on that ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnovitz</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , um, there was a certain lightness which I remember , and uh, I can identify it now as um, the worst has happened, and as, as tragic as it was to be separated from my parents, in a way it was um almost you know, some of my fear left me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You know, I was always afraid that I would see something, you know, and I once saw an SS man beat my father, and, I mean those were the most horrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And to see my parents concern about me and their concern about each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Now I knew that uh whatever would happen would happen to me, and uh, for some reason, I was really not afraid any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When I was with young girls, we went together, and then it was, was almost um something lighthearted that that happened there, and um, and I think that in itself um, I think it, it, it's much easier to bear whatever happens to you alone, not to watch someone you love, to, it's happening to them, and also to see their, their concern and pain when it's inflicted on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This is why I think perhaps it was so much more difficult for people uh that had to suffer together. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And of course, youth, you know, also is uh, you know, is resilient, that, at that point I was 18, and uh, then of course, I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for 3 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we came to um was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolknehein</span> , I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We were marched from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">People looked very curiously at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh, we came to an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> , uh, adjacent to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , which had a couple, uh, uh, uh a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and um, was a tremendous click as the <span class="DLF">gates</span> closed, sort of a finality, and there stood a woman clad all in black, and she was literally barking. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I have never heard a human voice being that harsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She looked like a bulldog, she, you know, and I said, "This 1s, this is going to be absolutely the worst." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were supposed to refer to her as uh Frau Kligler. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She turned out to be the hope, the inspiration and the knowledge that perhaps not all Germans were cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She was a decent wonderful warm caring human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">No doubt she was picked for her position because of her looks, but the looks completely belied what was underneath it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She was decent, she was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We stayed in that camp for a little over a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">No one was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh, I don't know if she particularly loved us, but uh she pinned a lie to the lips of all those who said they had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I personally am indebted to her for my own life at one point when this infamous Lindner, who was known for his cruelty, should come to for an inspection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I had been very ill at the time, I was running a very high fever, and I was permitted to stay in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and she came in with 2, no there was 3 of us who were ill, and she came in she said, "Girls, get yourself together." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I remember I couldn't put my, I had my skiing boots, and my father made me wear my skiing boots when I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , skiing boots in June, and I blessed him for it because I wore those boots for 3 years in every season, and I remember she stooped down to tie my boots and she literally dragged me and the two other girl to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She had worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she set my looms in motion, and said, "Pull yourself together. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">This is life or death today." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And, uh, before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , ----------the few of us who survived all left the positions that if Frau Kligler should be found, you know she might have been arrested for, for being the head of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where actually she was the person who had saved many lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And uh, she was sort of a bright light in this darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Uh, there was spiritual resistance when you were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and she sort of must have looked the other way, can you tell me...
ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You know, I mean, look, she demanded certain things, I mean I don't want to give you the impression that you know she was too--we worked very hard, you know we were, we were taught to weave, and uh, the work was very difficult, and uh, you know, you had to be very swift and that because uh, the material which we were weaving, you know, was, was very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The threads would break, and everything was interpreted as a sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">If you didn't work it like, uh skilled uh weavers would have 2 looms, we had 4 looms to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean, it was hard uh, uh backbreaking labor, but uh, but we still had some food, I mean uh you know, you, you didn't, you, you would consider it dreadful under normal circumstances, but of what was to follow later, I, I think of that as a transition period you know from uh from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and from, from love and from normalcy to, to the horror which followed, I, I think that uh that she made it bearable, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She did not steal any of our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We, we got the food uh you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">If somebody was ill, as I mentioned, I was at that particular time, she let you stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She, she, she really tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">She was a human being, and uh, and I think it was terribly important to meet a human being under those, those circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You know, to a lot of people, I believe that um a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> seems like a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> where people step on each other for survival, they stole from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That wasn't the case at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And again, I speak only about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in which I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And um, and I can say that I have seen the finest qualities of humanity there. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The sharing and the caring, and you know, if uh, whatever one had one shared with somebody else be it a crumb of bread, or if somebody had a birthday you know, and on Sunday we sometimes got margarine on our bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We would scrape the margarine off on Sunday from several of the pieces to save it for the person who had the birthday, to honor birthday, put some margarine on the bread, and, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My closest friend, Ilsa of whom I speak so often once found a raspberry in the --------, and she carried it in her pocket all day long, through a hot day, a raspberry, a total possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And that night she reached out and through the barbed wire, and got a leaf and washed it, and she presented the ra-raspberry on a leaf. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was her total possession, and people did some wonderful things there, and those are the things that I want to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You know, and we had very little time, of course, you know, and most, most of the time we were very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Whatever free time we had, but that was used if somebody remembered of seeing a, a particular film or ballet or something, it was shared, and you know, and an acted out, and um, oh there, there was an enormous support system there, and um, it, it that really was the, the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to survival, that on one hand we experienced extreme cruelty, and on the other hand, incredible love and friendship, and there was a balance there, and there was hope there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And somehow you um, you know, you saw of, of them, the Nazis like um, you know, I, I would fantasize to, to look like a snake or this and that, I mean you didn't think of them as human, but you could identify the others as human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I always thought of them as below my contempt, you know, and this is how you could somehow take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Sometimes, of course, you fell under the spell of it, you know, when they would march you out and, and tell you that you'll be here all your life and this and that, and I always said, you know, you can fall under that, you know, you have to imagine how uh, how they will look dead and things like that, you know, and I was spinning fantasies, and, and that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now again, you know, you, you have to be very young at that time or with a very vivid imagination, which fortunately I had so um, you know, I, I could sort of often lift myself out of that and imagine different things, and, and almost, almost anything could conjure this type of picture sometimes, you know the um, I remember you know working on the looms and we had overhead lights and the way um sometimes the light fell on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span> , I could remember that light coming through to my <span class="DLF">window</span> in the morning when I was a child waking up, and then I could build a whole picture around that and black out everything that was around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I lived sort of in, in a world, you know, you could live on 2 levels, there's, there's no problem about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I guess even now I do live on two <span class="INT_SPACE">levels</span> , you know, sometimes the other one comes up and makes it a little more difficult when uh, when that intrudes, but most of the time you can, you can keep it down.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Well um, uh, when Christmas again it was under Frau Kigler's uh time, uh during Frau Kigler's time, I think Christmas and New Ye--and um, Hannukah sort of fell together, and so we had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In those days we were allowed a hot shower after that was over and that was the best shower I ever remember, it was hot because no, we, we didn't have hot showers, we were permitted to shower once a week cold shower, but this was a hot shower, sort of a special deal, and uh, we were going to put on a play because everybody else was busy and Frau Kigler, we did not worry with her very much about you know because we did throw some things in Polish and of course she didn't understand Polish, so that was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Uh, my friend Ilsa and I um staged a play, and others of course participated 1n it as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Some people had wonderful singing voices and danced, so we were going to have a performance, and um, this particular play dealt with 2 grandmothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Ilsa and I were two grandmothers in that play. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Um, we gathered some um stuff from under the looms and put it on our hair to make it grey, and we had found little pieces of wire, and made such granny glasses, and um, I wrote that play in, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> at night, and the next day we performed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We were sitting near the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">There was a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> there, we had pushed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> aside, and we were talking about the wars, the past, of course, you know, predicting great futures for everyone, and um, I still remember uh, uh the words of the play. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">One of my friends who as a matter of fact lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> reminded me of, of that particular thing, and then we had our two granddaughters come up and they listened to us for a while, you know, sort of with a bored look, and they said, "Oh, uh, come on let's talk about old boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You know how old people exaggerate." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And so we were 17 and 18 respectively at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We somehow seemed to have hit upon the very core of existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That someday we will live in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Jewish grandmothers will be allowed to live, and Jewish grandchildren will live, but best of all, to live in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the climate will be such that our children and grandchildren will not believe our tales of the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The person who played my granddaughter in that play is alive; she's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">She is the mother of one of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's most decorated heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Tragically, the person who played IIlsa's granddaughter is not alive, just as Ilsa is not alive, and neither are the faces that I remember looking at -----------. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We performed it on the one naked, very d------------- walk??? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">in the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And it's probably, in retrospect, one of the most rewarding moments of my life, I have been able to make them forget, even for an hour.</span></p>

could occupy your mind and hang your thoughts on trivia of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It became very important, and this is how you passed the hours and forgot the hunger and, and the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I uh, I do believe that if you were blessed with imagination that that you could work that. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Um, if unfortunately you were a person that faced reality, I think you didn't have much of a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I felt I was lucky because I never faced reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I still don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Uh, but when we went, um, when we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span> , which was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We, we left for another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we did not have enough uh, raw material to, to do any weaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Um, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span> had a sort of a sister uh <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> called, uh, there were several, one of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshut</span> , and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span> , and so and we were send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span> was a horrible camp by comparison with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">First of all we were housed in, in a <span class="BUILDING">bldg</span> maybe on the 6th or 7th or <span class="INT_SPACE">8th floor</span> , way up and it was terribly hot there, it was middle of the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And of course the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were nailed down, I mean, we were literally broiling there, and the people in charge there were in complete contrast to what we knew about Frau Kigler. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There was a Lager Feuhrer in there, who was perhaps 18 or 19 years old, the most vulgar-looking thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Uh, she was wearing rings on every finger, and then sometimes 2 or 3 rings on each finger, and she had short stubby red hands, and her enjoyment was to, she had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , like children right around, and she would sit in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a little whip, and we had to um pull her. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That was her, her joy, I mean, the mentality of that person was, was not to be believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And then there was another person there, who was in charge of us, and she had been um, a guard in one of the female um jails, and we sometimes had, and the work that we did, um, people who were, who committed some, some sort of misdemeanor or what have you, in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , came to spend a day working with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And that was our normal work. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Um, we worked at different jobs there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Um, one of the jobs, which was uh dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">There were several that were bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">One was to um hand a bricks one to another, and we were to throw the brick and, and catch it quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">If you didn't, it landed on your hands, and uh, it crushed your fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The other job was to go in a nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> because they were growing linen there, and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , you had to put um, uh, the li--the not finished linen, the thing that had grown into the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> to because then it opened, uh, the <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> in which the threads, the lin--, the linen was--I don't know if I'm explaining it right--that was backbreaking labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">You had to stand in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> doing that, and that's was swarming with mosquitoes, and then other thing that we did is uh load into a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> , an enormous <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> , I don't know how many stories high, um, a man with a crane was throwing down bundles, and we were standing on that, and you know the bundles uh, came crashing down, and you had to arrange them, and you could easily be swallowed up in that, first of all, you were swaying all the time, and uh, and then they came so fast that if you didn't catch it fast enough, it hit you and it pricked your skin, and then, then your skin was bleeding, and then you were in the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> , and the mosquitoes were eating in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was a horrible time, and it was there in that <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> where some of the women came from <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> who had committed murder or God knows what, as punishment for a day, and they said they preferred solitary anytime than to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Um, it was there as a matter of fact where I uh, really felt I was going to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There was one overseer who uh was particularly cruel to me, and he had singled me out for uh for this type of punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So, during the day, I was working with flax or uh ----------the bundles. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">At night we had to shovel coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , uh you know, came loaded with coal, we had to shovel it because <span class="DLF">tracks</span> had to be cleared, and it was going on day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Once we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going by we didn’t’ know if there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with uh with German soldiers going back, and people said there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> of people we sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And um, and I remember my resistance really weakening there, and I thought to myself once after the um, the cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was empty and I was with that, standing on that, with that shovel in my hand, and I, I said it would be so easy now to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">An oncoming <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and it would be over in, in a couple seconds, and become a part of that stillness like we have to face tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It's, it's going to be tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It's going to be flax in the morning and, and the bundles at night, and, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> again, and the hunger, and that I, I, I just felt I had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I, I resisted that, and then, another day came by and the next night it uh, and I remember too, you know, I had promised my father, there was one thing I was never going to, to do 1s, is to really give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was sort of a, but, but there I came very close to doing it, and I remember that one night, when I definitely saw that it was a beautiful moonlit night, and I said to myself, "It's time to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I heard very faint oncoming of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , very far away probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And suddenly I felt a pain in my both sides of my, my neck, very sharp, and um, it was right in the beginning of the war when we not heard from my brother and my mother was sick, and we were told that we had to leave with 20 lbs of our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And I remember standing there, and we heard of a family who committed suicide together, and I sort of half-wished that my parents had suggested that. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was also very close to my father, and I remember I stood there, and was thinking about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">My father must have guessed my thoughts because he came up to me, stood behind me and he said, "What you are thinking 1s, 1s cowardly and is wrong." </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he said, "Promise me that you are never going to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I didn't answer him. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And he took my head, as he stood behind me and he turned me back forcefully toward him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Second Sticks???</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Uh, very early in the war while we were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as a matter of fact, we were still living in, in our own <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was shortly after my brother was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And my, my mother was really gone to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She was quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And my father had the recurring, recurring thing with his heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And we got orders to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with 20 pounds of our belongings, and my father told me to sort of pack suitcases, I had no idea how to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And I, we had heard of a family who committed suicide together, and uh I, I really thought at that point that that, that would be good, to do that, and I had hoped that my parents would suggest that. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I remember standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and thinking about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And my father came up behind me, and uh he, he always knew what I was thinking and he, he said to me, "What what you were thinking is, is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It's cowardly, it's, it's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He said, "You promise me never to do that no matter what." </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I didn't answer him, and then he, he sort of took me, he took my head, like that, and he turned it toward me, toward him, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want your promise now. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I said, "Papa I promise." </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And uh, during those last days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span> , that promise became pretty faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I, I, I was, I was exhausted, you know, I don't know how, uh anymore, how many days and nights I, I was working in that heat, in, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , and uh, and the cold, and the just everything -------- together, and I, I, I really wanted to, to end it. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And at that precise moment when I really most decided it, I mean, I don't know if I would have carried it through or not, but I have a feeling that I that I was pretty much at the, at the end of my rope there. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I knew that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going to come, and I figured, I, I'm going to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Suddenly I felt that very sharp pain in my neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And the promise came back, and obviously I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Strange thing is, the following day, everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The following as we were working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , um, that overseer, that that fury came running and had a list in her hand, and asked the people who had the following numbers to come forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I, I, I think my mind must have been so muddled, I wasn't even thinking, um, and Ilsa's number was called, she was working with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">See, Ilsa was not working nights, uh, at that was sort of directed more against me or, or a few other people, and he called Ilsa's number, and nobody rai-raised their hands, and she said, "Well who has that number?" </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And Ilsa took my hand and she said, "She did." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I wasn't even aware of what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She obviously was substituting her number for mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">She wanted to save me from something. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I was led away, and Ilsa jumped out of -------, and she also started running, and as we came to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there stood the director of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span> , and uh, Ilsa literally threw herself at, at his feet, and she said, "I want to go with my sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So he said, "What is your number?" </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then she gave her correct number and mine, and he said, "Well you both are on the list." </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So he said, "You run and wash up you, you look like pigs," uh, and actually what was happening is they needed more people for weaving and he came to collect from this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which was not a <span class="BUILDING">weaving factory</span> , to an adjacent one called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshoot</span> , which was also under the auspices of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span> , and uh, again we were loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I couldn't wait for the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to open, to get out of that, I, I didn't know how to thank Ilsa for it, but I remember that I, I just said to her, "I'm glad I didn't jump." </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And she said, "What did you say?" </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I said, "I'll tell you someday." </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I never told her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  How did that Lager Feuhrer have it in for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Um, I, I can only surmise um I, I was cleaning some, some small component in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and, and he came up--he, he wasn't a lager fuehrer, he was, he was um, sort of a supervisor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And he said to me, "Um how, how would you like some hot soup or some bread?" </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You know, which was sort of, I said, well, I said to myself, "Why is he saying that to me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="349">If he wanted to help me, why doesn't he give me a piece of bread?" </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So, I sort of said, uh, "Well, I eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ," which I felt, you know, was, was stating the truth without accusing them that they're not giving us enough to eat, but, but not saying anything, and so I uh, I gathered that he had maybe a certain designs on me, or maybe just wanting to test me, I don't know, you know, they were, well, that, incidentally, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not much of a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There were a lot, uh, there were very few men around working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , were mostly old, and there were a lot of young pretty German girls there, so that was, that was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">In any event, I think, just the type of defiance that I showed, uh he decided to sort of break my spirit, maybe out of sport or, or just to show his ------------, and this is what I was picked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">For every type of, of hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But um, I think it's a terribly important lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">One should never ever, ever give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">No matter how difficult a thing is you know, uh, giving up 1s a final solution to a temporary problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Our problem wasn't so temporary. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Nevertheless, it would pass, but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life, and to hold on to it as long as possible, and to me, this was really the most important thing, and I would say that during that entire time that I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was a little, I mean, except for the beginning of the war when I really did not know, and only heard that the family had chosen that <span class="DLF">path</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">This was the only incident that I remember, through all the years, that I really came close to calling it quits. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">That's why I love to say to young people, never ever, ever give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The darker the night, the brighter the dawn, and it sure was bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And it sure was dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  I want to jump back to your 18th birthday, what your mother did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  My 18th birthday was literally a few weeks, my birthday is May 8th, and on the 29th, 28th and 29th of January, the 29th I left, I was separated from my mother on the 28th and my father, it was about 5 weeks before, so that was my last birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And uh, my mother decided to have a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">She invited a number of my friends and she somehow had gotten some oatmeal, and baked some cookies, which we all swore tasted marvelously well, like almonds, and um, my parents gave me an incredible present. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They gave me an orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I've always loved oranges. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And of course, then an orange in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was, was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I later learned that my mother had given a very treasured and very valuable ring for that orange, and that was the last present I got from my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Tell me about your brother-------------.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  My brother was almost two and a half years older than I, and he uh, he was really my hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">My brother was very good looking, and people used to say, uh, my mother was a very beautiful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">People used to say, "It's a shame she has such a beautiful mother, and that she looks like her father, but the boy looks so much like the mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So you know, I always sort of grew up in the shadow of my brother, who was extremely good-looking and very accomplished, and everything he touched he seemed to be able to do well, and we fought at times, but by and large, he was a wonderful brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He always protected me, and uh, and of course, he had his friends coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there were boys around you know, and I, I started to get interested in boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And a lot of my friends were seeking my friendship because of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And um, the first day when the Nazis came in there, rounded up people they would find, and put them in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and set the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on fire, that was really the first, the first deed, the first horror which was inflicted upon the citizens of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And it was shortly before my brother was taken away when he had to go to register at uh what was like the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> , which was not too far from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> had been destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And I went with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I don't remember if it was now on the way to where to register, or on the way back, I rather think it was on the way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We passed by the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and we climbed over the debris, and we were sitting there talking, and was sort of he, he talked to me very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">You know, usually he, he talked down to me a bit, but it was more like an equal, and uh, it was one uh, pillar of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> that stood on all the destruction, and he said to me, "Look at that one." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He said, "It survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We are going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They can't do it to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And then, he picked up a couple of little stones, which were charred, and he put one in his pocket and he gave me one, and he said, "I want you to carry it with you all the time, to remind you of, of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and our conversation." </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I, I carried it with me, but uh, later on, on that death march, I must have lost 1t someplace, I carried it in a little sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I had sewn a little sack, and I, I carried it on, on my neck with a string. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I, I lost it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  I don't remember where I finished at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Just start with the death march.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Sort of getting a little... Well...three years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became progressively worse as um, raw material was running out, and also as uh it seemed that the war was taking a different turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We sort of knew that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> should be victorious, our doom is going to be sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But if, for what we prayed for that, that we would be liberated, we were afraid that when things start turning uh bad for them, they are going to let uh their, their venom and their frustrations out on us, so that was really a no win situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It became pretty obvious in the winter of 1944 as it turned to 45, when um, uh there were fr-a frequent um we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming in and, and uh, uh production stopped, and things were, were getting bad, and then on the night of the 28th, rather the day of the 28th of January, 45, we did not go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Was a workday, and we did not go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We were told to stay incamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And toward evening we heard an enormous commotion, and uh, a transport of 2000 girls came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , mostly Hungarian girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They told us they had been marching, that um, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , uh the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> had moved closer, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was being liberated, and they were running away from the advancing Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And uh, we, we were going to join that march the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Was bitter cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Was in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And I was coughing terribly, I had a very bad cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And my 3 dearest friends, Susie Kuhns, Lizzy Schteburn, Ilsa Klein Zeller and I, we hurried together the four of us, and they, they were very concerned about me, they said, "You know, if you can only pull through with that terrible cold and the terrible cough," like the pneumonia or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And in the morning, very early, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, not to the type of freedom we had hoped, but it opened to an, an incredible picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">There was freshly fallen snow for as far as the eye could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And an enormous sort of it was a <span class="DLF">plateau</span> , and then it came up to, to a gentle <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and it was just, just covered with snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was grey, it was snowing, and uh we were told to uh assemble for a -----------, so of course, there was the four of us, and uh we held hands, and we took the first step, and I guess we all knew that this was going to be the first step to the end of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Either to liberation or to, to doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And in front of us stretched this incredible <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Well this was the very last phase of the war when we were on this death march, which started on the 29th of January in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenberg</span> , in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We sort of, our, our destination actually was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranenburg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranenburg</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">murder camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranenburg</span> fell into the hands of the Russians, and we were zig-zagging through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , ending in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in a tiny <span class="NPIP">place</span> called ------------, where the march came to a halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Um, Ilsa had died just a week before. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">It was evening, and um, one of the SS women came by and she mentioned to one of my friends to take my boots off, which sort of signaled you know the last thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">My friend, her name was Hanna Kudlidsky, Hanna Keller in those days, told me that, and she said, "Hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Don't let her see you." </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And um, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came, and she said to me, "You know, you better get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> so she shouldn't see you." </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I said, "You know I'm, I'm in no hurry." </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And I remember sitting there and, and really knowing that this was definitely the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> overhead, there was shooting, and the the German army was running away, there were people on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> with children with animals, tremendous chaos, and uh, I was sitting there and it, 1t was really a beautiful night, it was May, it suddenly got a little warmer, and uh, and I permitted myself the luxury of thinking of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , of my parents of my, my brother in a different sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I always thought of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but um, but somehow this was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> didn't come back for us, and they came, and there was this enormous <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we were sort of in front of it, and they it was in the they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and was told that they planted a time bomb to, to blow us up--won't fall into the hands of whoever were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">We didn't know if it would be the Russians or the Americans or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I uh, I must have been pretty sick during that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I um, uh, only isolated things which, which I remember, when I remember that we, we tried to break out of there, and we couldn't, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were really locked and, and chains were put around it and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And uh, it started to rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Torrential rain, which obviously somehow um, the bomb and -------- did not connect. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And then we are told that they're coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I remember crawling in into one of those long um <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , a cylinder that was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and a few of us crawled in there, and there was some shooting, I remember a bullet went by, and then it was quiet again, and then the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , must have been the following morning, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened, the Czech people called and said the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Uh, I, I didn't understand the reality of, of that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">My , uh, then there were some Americans that night before, but my two um impact of...of freedom and of it being over actually must have happened that following morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I do know that the SS had run away, and they had changed their uniforms into civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I did find um one of those great coats, from the army, and I wrapped, wrapped myself in it and, and tried to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I must have been quite feverish, I was already I think quite ill, and it was the following morning that it, I, as I said we met the Americans the night before, but I think, but all that some-somehow sinks into oblivion. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">My, my very clear um, view of ,of freedom and liberation came that morning when I stood in this <span class="DLF">doorway</span> of that abandoned <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coming around the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And the reality of that came when I saw the white star on its hood and not the swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">There were two men in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">One jumped out, came running toward me and asked if there was anyone who spoke English or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I told him I spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I remember that aura of him, of that awe, of, of disbelief, in daylight to really see someone who fought for our freedom, for my ideals, and uh, he looked like, like God to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I uh, I knew what I had to say, and I said to him, "We are Jewish, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="609">For a very long time, at least to me it seemed very long, he didn't answer me, and then his own voice betrayed his emotion, he was wearing dark glasses I couldn't see his eyes, he said, "So am I." And the impact of that to be liberated not only by an American, but by a fellow Jew, um, it, it, it just, so totally uh, I mean, um, I think this is when that that feeling of such an incredible joy which fills your, your whole, whole being. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It, it, it must have, just burst out, I, I, I remember I couldn't get a hold of myself then. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But then he said, asked a strange question. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">He said, "May I see the other ladies?" </span><span class="sentence" id="613">A form of address we hadn't heard for six years." </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I told him that most of the girls were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and were too ill to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He said to me, "Won't you come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I didn't know what he meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So he, he held the <span class="DLF">door</span> open for me and let me proceed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And that was the moment of restoration of, of humanity of humaneness, dignity and freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And this first young American of liberation day is now my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">He opened not only the <span class="DLF">door</span> for me, but the <span class="DLF">door</span> to my life and my future. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I took him to see my friends, but I was very sad because that morning I went to look for Susie, because Lies] said to me, "Susie went out to get some water, and she has not returned." </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So I went out to look for her, and I found her near the <span class="DLF">pond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I thought she had fainted, and I touched her, and she was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I wanted to tell her, "Susie," and I did tell her, I said, "Susie, we are liberated, we are free." </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We had made a bet more than three years earlier on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I said we will be liberated, and she said we would not. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I didn't tell Liesl. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I couldn't tell her. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Liesl was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We all were very sick, we were immediately taken to a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> in --------- before a <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We were very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I weighed 68 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">My hair was white, so I was going to be 21 the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I was told that Lies] had trouble with her legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">She had uh been injured, uh, she had been shot in the leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I asked to see her, and was told that I was too sick to, to go there and couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I kept asking and asking, and I sort of collapsed for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And finally I was told that she had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Of the four of us, I was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I was the one that had the cold and they were all concerned about me that I would not make it, and I was the only one who, who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The only one from my family, the only one of my dearest friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  Tell me about the numbers of the girls that started out and the number of girls who ------------.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  About 4,000 when we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">2,000 from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">2,000 that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">When they were on the way, there were certain divisions, we had stopped in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and a few of the girls had had run away, most of them who had run away, uh were caught and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">A few however managed to escape, and uh,-----------------. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I'm, I'm not sure of the exact number. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Uh, when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , we were about 120 of this entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Of those, quite a few still died. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">There is now a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volari</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czechoslovaki</span> where we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">There were 95 or 96, 96 <span class="DLF">graves</span> , but 95 of our girls were -------------------------. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I thought I made liberation such a happy story and I find it didn't turn out that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Change film, camera roll 10 1s up; Sync take 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Beep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  I want you to talk to me about the legacy, the goodness that you saw in ------------------------, and feel free to retell the raspberry story, or other examples that you've done before as though you hadn't told before. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Tell me when. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  Now? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Looking back now over almost half a century, it is half a century, um, I think one is struck by the nobility of the spirit which also lived in this darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">The act of kindness, the type of support, the selflessness and the love, which I think was the support system to be able to endure that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">A belief in something. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Not, uh the inhumanity of, of our um captors, but, but the humanity which existed in the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And there was a great deal of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">My friend Ilsa, who gave me that raspberry, she carried it in her pocket all day long on a hot incredible day, and derived joy of giving it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Um, the one time when we uh stood roll call for, for a long time, and a piece of bread sailed over the barbed wire into our group and one of the girls caught it, and we all knew whence it came and who had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And we were all questioned, we were all beaten, no one gave the person away. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">If someone which became much more difficult later when we were not with Mrs. Kigler any anymore, who had showed such humanity, but later on when really cruelty and bestiality was the reign, um, one helped the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">You know, if somebody couldn't work or was sick, you know, we, we all tried to, to help the other person, to pull them through. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Um, and, and that was taken absolutely for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Now I don't mean to say that that everyone there was, was angelic. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I mean uh, we were human, but by and large, and this is why, you know, when I wrote my first book, to me it was the most important thing to be able to put on that it 1s all based on truth, I used all names, all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and I whatever I have written, I always use my maiden name as well as my married name. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I want anyone to challenge the truth of that statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Unfortunately so few stories you know survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Um, so little has been said about that, you know because the overwhelming thing there of course was uh, was so horrible, and, and when one tries to um, to explain the holocaust, it uh, it is a horror which um, which has the upper hand because such horror has, has never, uh, never been done to, to, to people with so, that somehow what seems to escape are the little acts of kindness, the everyday thing, which, which really spurred the spark of hope that one had to have in order just to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And that was the, and I don't know of anyone who committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by barbed wire, which was electrically charged. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Not one person that I know of ever went and touched it. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So we certainly had enough reason to, to do it quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">No one did. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Everyone wanted to live with, with every fiber of one's being, and I think that was a defiance. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They wanted us dead, but we are going to live for as long as we possibly can. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And we did, and this is why it is so sad, that when one sees pictures of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , one sees those big vacant eyes over the barbed wire, people who look more like animals than as human beings and no one seems to know what was going on uh in the minds and hearts of the people, that they were looking at something beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I remember one time, a, a bird flew into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and it perched itself on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and started to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">No, no one ever had a more appreciative audience than that bird did, and how, how we watched its flight then to freedom over, over the barbed wire and ov-ov-over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and one time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenberg</span> , uh, where we also stood for hours roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Uh, one spring, in the corner of this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , the among the debris of the cement, a flower poked its head, and you could see hundreds of feet shuffling around it, nobody stepped on the flower. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was something incredible to see uh that a flower heralded sort of a new spring of, of, of ----------of beauty. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Now, you know, one should not need uh stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to appreciation of, of beauty, but, but it was an incredible moment to see that, that many things that one sees for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Um, there were beautiful things there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Unfortunately, and that is always the biggest pain, that so few lived to know the joy of freedom, and that is the most painful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And sometimes the difficulty to, to enjoy all the things, to know how many were deprived of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That's, that's the hardest thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But I think if one can somehow give the legacy of the nobility to the inheritance of this new spring and new generation of children and grandchildren, who have grown up in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">If they can understand it and, and value it, then, they have achieved a sort of immortality. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I think this is really why they have to understand something, because it is difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You know, millions, numbers have no meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It's the identification is one that counts, and if, if someone somehow today, and people who live in freedom can take the identity of just one who was deprived of it at all, and live their lives vicariously, and enjoy the things for which, which they have so hungered, I think that uh, that we will build a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I have hopes for the world in spite of everything.</span></p>
