<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  You were three years old now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012
QUESTION:  Almost three, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  And there was a, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> next to me there was a, well there was a British soldier, part of the British Expeditionary Forces that were stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> before the war started and the officer was looking up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> with binoculars. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Then I fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">When I woke up he was gone and I asked my mother where was is this soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And she told me that the soldiers were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And she seemed to be afraid at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Later I learned that the British soldiers were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> , which was just over the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  All right, let’s move ahead then to right before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">You said your mother came and got you from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially Mrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my mother showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She came and visited me occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my parents’ <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> which was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that looked like it was in a vacant <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I didn’t know why she wanted to come and pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von der Linden, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I went with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And at some point, at a stop, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> came by. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was being pulled by a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Apparently it had run out of gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And there was also a soldier lying on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with a heavy machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They looked very insecure. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They kept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Don’t forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  And you still have remembered it? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Very vividly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I have not forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So then we went, I thought we were going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the corner where there was a <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I didn’t know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> around the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> so she got a little panicky and she went into the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And once she was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , she was just standing there and the woman who ran this <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> told her come in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There were, in many <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">living area</span> , behind the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And above the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And my mother hesitated to go in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So the woman said that her husband was Jewish which was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so they became friends and their <span class="DLF">backyards</span> were connected cause they were at right angles to each other and there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> separating them but they made arrangements to go over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in case some danger would happen to one or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In several cases, my parents went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I don’t remember these peoples’ names, went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">One time I know it’s because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So they didn’t know that it was, 1t wasn’t for them, so they went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And as it was getting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that’s where my mother took me also. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I remember once I was standing in the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> and I saw, on the corner, I saw a group of men wearing khaki, but they weren’t soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I didn’t know who they were and they were carrying cases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to other men that came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I went back in the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> and I asked what’s going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Who are these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Then again shortly after that, I don’t know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">One morning my mother took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She said we’re going to go to, it was a <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I didn’t know exactly why we were going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And she said the English are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I’m not sure what she said actually but she said the English. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">She probably did but I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I didn’t know what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn’t my father coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And she tried to explain that he hadn’t been <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , except to go to the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> for two years and he was not ready to face people. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So we were walking along. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My mother was kind of in a hurry and we were on one <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we passed a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> that was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And I was fascinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don’t know if it was, I assume it was a <span class="BUILDING">German tent</span> , now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail had been thrown at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was burning on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I didn’t seen any soldiers, just fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I stopped to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My mother said let’s go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Everybody was rushing to this <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And when we arrived there, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> lined up in all the <span class="DLF">lanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was all very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was a soldier standing on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And we looked at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We looked at the soldier, he looked at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and — (crying) — he pulled me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And he held me in his arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I looked at my mother and she said, give him a kiss cause we didn’t have any way of communicating with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So I did and then I looked back down and she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I couldn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">That was all, this job that my mother was crying and she said it’s all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">After that, I don’t remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens like she had promised to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But there was another reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My brother and sister were by then they were living in the Ardennes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn’t easy because we had to go there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">municipal trams</span> maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But they weren’t running. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So and there was no communication so anyway I went back to the Von der Lindens and I didn’t really know how long I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Von der Lindens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French, Belgian. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There wasn’t a red flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And these flags, I know how people made them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were the size of double sheets hanging down in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And then one day I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no flags on the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She ran a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , sort of a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very anxious cause I didn’t know this at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was many years later that I figure out this was the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the Von der Lindens after the liberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The liberation was in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And so I was still with the Von der Lindens at the time of the Battle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Then after probably a short time after that, ’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My parents had found, rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where they lived was much too small for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And so they rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a nice little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 Her father was my mother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And her parents had been deported on the last transport from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Number, it was transport number 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They also had a son who had the same name as my brother Manfred, or Mani. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">At some point they were hidden together by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Father Joseph Andre who has been recognized by Yad Vashem and many other organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He placed the kids in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> or <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> or in private families. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But until he found the <span class="NPIP">places</span> they stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the Germans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So he had to go into hiding himself, the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And my brother went to live with a family that was not really -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the Ardennes. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But my cousin didn’t have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and so he went back to his parents’ <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they were denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My aunt is the only one that came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was hidden someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So my parents took in Lottie and she was living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We still didn’t know the fate of my mother’s brother and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">One day his wife came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I happened to be there alone one afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The doorbell rang and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was this strange woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Somebody I didn’t know and she also looked strange a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And she didn’t say anything for a long time and I didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I knew I wasn’t supposed to let in strangers in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she didn’t say anything and finally she, she said I’m your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn’t recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">First two years had gone by since we had gone into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But also she had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> during that time and on a death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the beginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And also at some point she pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was her number tattooed on her arm. (</span><span class="sentence" id="139">pause) I had started going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I, actually I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already when I was living with the Von der Lindens. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">At first when they were living out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it was a <span class="REGION">Flemish area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There was Flemish which I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So that didn’t help me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Then later when they moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I went to a <span class="BUILDING">French speaking school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But there were some gaps there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So when I moved in with my parents again I started https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I was a year behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And later I caught up. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood school</span> and the fourth, fifth and sixth grade were in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So I could hear and see what this, the class ahead of me was doing so by the end of the fifth year of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the teacher said I could go on to the seventh grade which was a, in like what do you call it here, <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So I caught up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">In 49, my brother got his visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Since my brother and sister and I were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but our parents were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we the kids got visas earlier because the quota was shorter for Germans than it was for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So my brother got his visa first. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My parents were not that interested in moving to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They got established again in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They were happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But my brother wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And shortly after that, that was in 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Shortly after that my sister got her visa and she joined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , Washington. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then in 1951 my parents got their visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They had, I guess I could have gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> before but I was only 11 when my brother left so they didn’t want me to go without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on the Queen Mary. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then —
QUESTION:  And before, we’ll come to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I just wanted to ask you some questions though. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Was your family a very religious family?</span></p>

QUESTION:  That was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I was talking about while you were still in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Yeah well I had my bar mitzvah in Europe, also in 54. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">No, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I would say they were, they were a little religious but not very. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My mother did keep kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">What was before, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My brother thinks that when they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they were a little more mainly a little more religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012

</span><span class="sentence" id="622">Harry Markowicz: For over two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I was working on my masters which I didn’t get. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I got into a program that they -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had set up between linguistics, psychology and French, literature, not French literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And so it involved almost three departments and there were a lot of infighting between the faculty. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So many of us didn’t get our degrees because each one tried to get very high level of requirements for their field. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And I was teaching French. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Then for some reason two people in the same week told me about this new <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in I forgot the — After that, sorry, after that I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">community college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tacoma</span> , <span class="REGION">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">It was called <span class="BUILDING">Tacoma Community College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I taught French there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Then these two friends told me about this new <span class="BUILDING">university</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Simon Frazer University</span> in <span class="REGION">British Columbia</span> near https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vancouver</span> and for some reason, both said this separately you'll fit in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So I didn’t know exactly what they meant but I called the chairman of the foreign language department, or maybe I’m sorry linguistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It was a combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I told him I was interested and he said ok come on up. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">This was 67. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And we can talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So after a few minutes he offered me a position as an instructor. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I didn’t have a transcript or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And then he introduced me to some of the people in the department and the French woman and she told me she was a graduate associate. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I knew what a graduate assistant was because I had been one but it’s a little higher level and more paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So I went back to the chairman of the department and said what is this graduate associate thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Can I do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Cause I don’t have a PhD and I'd like to work on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He said oh sure, you can do that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And so I, and they paid very well too. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So I became a graduate associate and taught French and I got my MA degree there. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Meanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I’ll make it very brief. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become popularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one could learn a language more easily if it had universals. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But everybody already knows a language so that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological Foundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> don’t know any language. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So I decided ah ha, that’s my, those are going to be my subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Just about this time there was a letter published in the Vancouver newspaper in response to an article which I had not seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But the writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And have a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a half, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Two sign sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">This was exciting because that’s what hearing children in whatever language they learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So I contacted the writer of the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He was a director of social welfare agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And we talked and I also met a deaf man there. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He introduced me to this deaf man he was writing about who I don’t remember how we talked, having a long conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And it became clear to me that if you’re deaf and you grow up in a deaf environment, namely <span class="BUILDING">deaf residential schools</span> , that it’s very similar to being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  Why do you say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012
ANSWER:  Because you are in a minority and you’re part of a larger society but you’re always a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of relationships you have among Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese may have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There’s a language aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There’s a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the community, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">deaf community</span> as an ethnic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Anyway this became very fascinating for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I got hooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn’t mention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it’s not a real language because it doesn’t have articles. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And it doesn’t have a passive voice which is pure nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">There are plenty of languages that don’t have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me about a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Gallaudet University</span> , William Stokoe who had worked on sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And suggested I contact him. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And immediately Stokoe sent me back books, several books that he had written on sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So I, with my masters papers on sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">This was in 1969, 70 at a time when sign language was not really accepted in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So I -- it was a cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">It was not my cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I couldn’t, I couldn’t fight for my cause, whatever that would be but I found that I wanted to take part in this fight for recognition of sign language and I could see eventually that it has to do with deaf civil rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So that’s what I did, get involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Eventually in what year was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">In 72 I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span> to work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And so I studied at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span> and then I started working at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gallaudet</span> in William Stokoe’s linguistic research lab where he did research on sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And it was funded by various grants, National Science Foundation and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">When the money started running out, I was no longer working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I worked there three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> during the summer of 75 with several colleagues from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gallaudet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">One in particular had a grant from maybe it was National Science, no it was National Endowment for the Humanities, a grant to study the historical foundation of American Sign Language, but its origins are from French sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So I was the French expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">My task was to go into the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the Humane school for the deaf in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and do research there on what was available on French sign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 There I met a sociologist who had some interest in deafness. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And then he knew the history of, this history of deafness, the controversy. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But he felt that all, he had been led to believe that with the new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And so we got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So he, next, the next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">It takes place every four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">He came here and then stayed afterwards with me and saw what we were doing in the <span class="BUILDING">linguistic research lab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And then he asked me if I would like to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , work with him, to get French sign language recognized in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So I took a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He got a grant there. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">That was 76. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Fall of 76. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And the year stretched to five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And in the meantime, after the first year I got married to my current wife Arlene who I knew already from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  And then you came back after the five years and did you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gallaudet</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  And then how long did you stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gallaudet</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Eventually, I got a position in the English department and I taught English 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I know the total number of years 1s 29 and, 29 years and nine months.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  That was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I know a lot of people who are volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">In 1985, I was one of the small group who were founders of an organization that Congress called, if I remember correctly, child survivors of the Holocaust in the <span class="REGION">Washington Baltimore area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It was Flora Singer who got us https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 together. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">First time was seven and we’ve been meeting ever since, once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And we also have, it’s become international and we have yearly international meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And so in this group a lot of people were volunteering.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  Is this the hidden child?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  And you signed those talks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  No, we had interpreters for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I mean there was a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Yeah but also instead of just having it as a class, I, we had this in an <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">It was open to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And somebody from the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> suggested to have a general who was one of the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I’ve forgotten now his name also. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But he was well known and he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So I had him come. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So and I selected people from my group who represented the whole scale of things from people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">The majority in our group were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But sharing their experiences, unique and everybody, there was somebody who came in a group of almost a thousand who were brought to the state, 44 and they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> and put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So there was a, and kindertransport and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So I knew I was going to do it but after I retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I don’t know why it took me a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I would ask who do I contact and oh, Pll let you know next time. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And then it wasn’t just their fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It https://collections.ushmm.org May 16, 2012 was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I could have just, I knew quite a few people already so, at the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I could have, but I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So —
