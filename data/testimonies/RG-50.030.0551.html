ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  In — I-I was born in 1940, so I assume like a year or so before, maybe two years before, because Jack was also born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And then, by the age of around two, we were put in hiding in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and I have absolutely no memory of that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And after I think about — well, I guess around 1945, we were brought by relatives to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I just today learned that we were in several <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but I only know of one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Taverne</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Taverne</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> , where I was until the age of [indecipherable] until 1948, when — November 7, 2008 where I then was adopted by American citizens, who were bo-both born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but they were both — they were both already American citizens, and we — I believe that happened in 1947, and it took about a year for the whole process to be finished, and I moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at the age of eight, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Do you — do you know anything about your birth parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Well, we have photographs of them, and I know that they were both sew — tailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I have photographs, but I — I dil — I don’t remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I rem — it’s all blocked out, basically, the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t know ti — a-anything, except what —
QUESTION:  Do you know their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Calpeak(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Rose and Joseph Calpeak(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  And do you — do you know — did they have any relatives that you were ever able to identify?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Not that we’ve been — yes, well, we had a — my father had a sister who also perished — or it was my mother, I think it was my mother’s sist — sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">You’ll have —I-—Ican’t—I have to verify, I— I—I don’t remember all these things, I forget them. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I mean, I — I put them out of my mind, pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They — and there was — there was another relation o — th-that — the daughters — the — the sister’s daughter is still alive — is alive in—1in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We’re in contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And there’s another cousin also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  So would this suggest that when your family left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it wasn’t just your immediate family, your father and your mother, but a larger group of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Perhaps, perhaps, but I have no — no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I t— I have never really delved into the details of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I know the fa — th-the minimal facts, and that’s —
QUESTION:  Have you been happy knowing just the minimal facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  It’s been —
QUESTION:  Maybe happy isn’t the right word, but —
ANSWER:  Well, yeah, no, I do — I don’t think it 1s the right word. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">For me it’s been — 1-it’s something that was, and I accepted, and I don’t feel that I can just delve on it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Or even to know if it — I don’t believe that it can help me personally in my life, so I just don’t bother. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I do — I go forward, not backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Do you know what happened, though, to your parents specifically? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Were you able to learn that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  That, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We — basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I know that my father was put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> much earlier, I don’t remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It’s not that I don’t know it, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And my mother, evidently — I keep hearing stories that she would cu — she had put us in hiding, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and she lived there as well, with the family and evidently there were other children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And she went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I — I believe and got caught and then sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  But you don’t know whi — where —
ANSWER:  Again, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It’s over and down, I just don’t remember these names, because they — they’re long and complicated things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  So you don’t — yeah, but you know, you — they’re not recognizable, you don’t know that it would have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> she was sent to —
ANSWER:  No, it’s not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">What’s your [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  [indecipherable] mental, it’s a mental block, so — which I — I accept that it’s there, and I — it doesn’t bother me too much, so —
QUESTION:  Well, you know, who’s to — who is anybody else to say how another person should deal with — with their stories and their lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Hm, right, right, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do — do you have an earliest memory in your mind, of anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  None, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The only — I-I used to — I used to have a memory or — or — of something like a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and we — I remember something — hearing — hearing people or children say something about Jews, and I never knew what that was about until I moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I would — any time I met French people, I would ask them if — because I only remember the tap — or the name, at that time, Taverne, the — the pla — the — where the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And, I would — any time I November 7, 2008 would meet French people, I would ask them if they knew of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And it happens that — actually the first job I had in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was with an architect, and one of the partners was an interior decorator, Frenchman, and he — he tur — his name was Josh Goldsta — is Josh Goldstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And he said yes, of cour — he of — he knows the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and it turns out that he and his wife both worked at this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , but once — after we’d already left there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  So, would —
ANSWER:  And so he described the — the setting, and that kind of made more sense, why that was stuck in my head, of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and —
QUESTION:  So, until you had that conversation with him, did you know that this 1s — you — could you place it in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> o — when you had this image of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , or you didn’t even know where that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  No, I didn't know where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I didn’t know where it was, because I never —
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was putting two and two together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Yeah, I never came across anyone — cause I — when — whenever I would ask if they kn — 1-it only started in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when I asked people where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Taverne</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And —
QUESTION:  What was your first language that you spoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  French. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  And was — how long was that the only language that you spoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Until the age of eight, and once we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , | think within about two months we learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I learned English perhaps faster than my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And, in fact I got very low grades in French when I studied, because I used to talk in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  — I’ve put that — I’ve also blocked that out, I mean, I — I know that, I — I accept it, I — now, 1-if I absolutely have to talk French, I might understand some. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I understand a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I don’t — I mean, I — in — in fact, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in Mitzpe Ramon there are a lot of French people, and I find the French very snobby about the language, so I don’t — I say, okay, I don’t talk French. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But [indecipherable] I can understand a little, because I studied a bit, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">When I wa — when I’m in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I — the few times that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I was able to talk to people in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but not to people that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Mental — good mental block. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But —
QUESTION:  Why do you think that mental block’s there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Probably there are things that I don’t want to remember, I mean, that’s quite clear, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  But it’s interesting, you know, when one has a mental block, when I think about it in my own life, there are har — there are some — there are some parts that have been hard, and if someone were to ask me to reconstruct them, it would not be easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I remember that they existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember, let’s say, a basic story about them, but not necessarily a specific within it, or certainly not a timeline. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But I know that they were there, you know, I — I was conscious when these events happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that’s what’s surprising for me 1s, when you’re not conscious, you don’t — you just don’t remember something. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Then the question 1s — 1s, is there a reason why you have no curiosity about it, or do you think you have no curiosity about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I’ve kind of never went too deeply into it because I just like my life, and I — I said, this is what happened, and I — you don’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You don’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You cannot solve — you’re right, you can find out, yes, your roots, and — and things like that, but I’m sure like there are reasons why I-I — I do —I do a lot of sewing so I can say, oh yeah, well, my parents were also —
QUESTION:  In that profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  — tailors, in that profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I do a lot of — I— I do artwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I don’t know whether there’s a connection there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But to me that’s just to go — you can’t go backwards, you can only go forwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So that’s why I don’t — I don’t s — November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  So, isn’t it difficult sometimes, being with people who — who have another need, the — the need to go backwards? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">How do you — how does that —
ANSWER:  That’s [indecipherable] had become difficult for me, that difficult perhaps for them, but not for — I don’t find it — that it’s difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I look at it, you know, it — these are facts that you can’t change, and I don’t — I don’t feel that knowing more about it — I learned now from — from my brother, who seems to know much — so much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But he’s a — for instance, he doesn’t remember me as part of — 1n his — in his life, and I don’t remember him in that wa —
QUESTION:  In that early life in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  — in -— yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So there’s —
QUESTION:  That was going to be one of my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yeah, so it’s — it’s —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  — I mean, that’s a —I say, okay, I mean, I’ve totally blocked it out, but — and he hasn’t, but there’s still a lot of things that he also doesn’t — hasn’t been able to relate to or to see clearly, or to understand clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And again, that for some — maybe because I live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and that’s — it’s a— my life 1s — 1s my life as it is, and without complications of my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">For me, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  When you got — what I guess I'd like to try and trace is, when you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or even if it was earlier, even though you were a child, a young child earlier, do you remember conversations coming up, about the war, about the Holocaust, about murders?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Did your paren — your adopted parents, what were they like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Oh, they were very good people, very nice people, very giving. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I don’t remember too much, if they talked very much about the war, but was — it was always a — it was not like — it wasn’t a hidden fact that we were adopted, we were — it was something that we were — we knew about. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It wasn’t sudden — suddenly we learned that we were adopted, and where we came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But I — I think I just kind of like, you know, fit in as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Like for instance, learning English. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I — I believe that within about two months I was talking English, I was fluent in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And do you have memories of your brother being able to, or having — struggling with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">How did your adoptive parents cross your <span class="DLF">path</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Do you remember —
ANSWER:  How did they what? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">November 7, 2008
QUESTION:  How did they cross your <span class="DLF">path</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Do you have memories of the first time you met them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Only through what they once — what they — my father told me — both of them, that when they came to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> — they came to visit your — 1n yo — they came to Europe and my father, who was very — an ardent Zionist, decided that the best way to find out what the situation was, was by going to an — a Jewish orphanage, and that’s how he — I-I don’t know exactly what the procedure was, but that’s how he came to that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and he always said that he — he saw me, and decided because they didn’t have children of their own, he decided to ad — to adopt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And my mother at the time didn’t want — my adopted mother didn’t want anything to do with it, because she was not feeling well at — at that — this was in °47. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And — but he — it was his decision, basically, and they said there’s also a brother. [</span><span class="sentence" id="114">indecipherable] said, okay, we’ll take both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But I don’t remember the situation, I don’t in — in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Aside from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , what would be other early memories that you can recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Only — yes —
QUESTION:  It doesn’t have to be Holocaust related, they could be about anything, just — just — what — what — what comes to your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">November 7, 2008
ANSWER:  Ah, there was — okay, there was one — as I said before, there was — hearing children yell out something about Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Was it a mean yelling out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Maybe — yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And, again this — this interior decorator said to me that we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , evidently, and in order to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we left the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and passed a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So, perhaps that kind of — so, for — at that point, that explained to me why I remember something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The details, nothing at all, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And there was one other thing of someone — and again, I’ve never delved into it, because it’s — I don’t think it’s a pleasant thing to remember, about — something about a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , and a — interestingly enough, I had a time when I di— I would paint a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And someone once decided that it wou — it showed that I — my — I hadn’t — that I didn’t have roots, and that was why I was drawing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I said, fine, that’s, you know, pretty clear, and understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But there was one thing that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mat</span> — someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name called <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> or zoe or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And this could have been a dream, or it could have been something in detail, that someone was hanging from a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , that’s all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I mean, that’s — it was never made — never clear, and I really don’t — I’m not all that interested to know too much about that. [</span><span class="sentence" id="130">indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Was it a shadow? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">November 7, 2008
ANSWER:  A shadow, or —
QUESTION:  A shadow of a person on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , was it — or —
ANSWER:  I can’t even say. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Just someone hanging on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , or hanging on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Like a —
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It doesn’t bring — it doesn’t bring up a — a — a pleasant image whatso — at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So, I put it out — I mean, I — it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When I was much younger, it would — it would — I would think about it now and then, but I — I pushed it out, and —
QUESTION:  Did you feel different than other children in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I think only in the — well, that’s — I think that’s why I se — I learned English very quickly, because kids in the s — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> would call me Frenchie, and I decided I didn’t — I wanted to be American, again, as quickly as I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  And did you feel different than other children because you were adopted, and you knew you were adopted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Maybe in the first few months, or the first year, because we did go to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then, when we went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , we would put — we were put back a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I never made up that year, whereas Jack did, because it wasn’t — because I’d become friends with — November 7, 2008 with kids that were — I was with, so, it was enough, I-I didn’t need to go — go ahead one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So no, I don’t think I felt too different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Can you describe to me a little bit about — I mean, I don’t know how to express this in a way that doesn’t sound much too — too many big words.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  But how does — how did you form your — I mean, most of the time children form their identity from all of these building blocks that are part of their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That doesn’t necessarily mean they stay there, but that’s what they have to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They have this <span class="DLF">building block</span> , this one, this one, this one, and then later they can say, well, I want part of this one, I want part of that one, I don’t want the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And little by little they start forming their identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">What formed yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">How did you form yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">What things did you choose to become who you are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  I think I was very influenced by the — by the Israeli — I think also — okay, we’re — when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I remember my father would — used to make records of us, he — he liked to sing and we — he made records of — of us talking 1n — and I remember one of the — even — no, even before I spoke English, I mensh — I thi — from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , we were ma — we were oriented to think about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I think that that was like — that was always my — my direction, 1s to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which I did, very — as soon as I-I finished at th — sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">When I ca — when I — in one November 7, 2008 of the tapes that we made, I said that I wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And this was like very early in —1n the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So I think that was always what pushed me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And because my parents, especially my father, was so much into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> himself, it always —
QUESTION:  It was natural.</span></p>
