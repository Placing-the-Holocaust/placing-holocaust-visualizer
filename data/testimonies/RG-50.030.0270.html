<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Did your family have a lot of information about what was happening so that your brother-in-law made this decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Nobody, we knew that Hitler wrote and the Germans used to tell us it's nothing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You're going to see what's waiting for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So, we knew that something 1s going on, but they didn't tell us what they're going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They used to say to everybody that they're sending us to work, to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but never they're going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she said you tell my family that I'm going to see , to be with because she found out that he is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">She didn't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">She was in a very bad shape, depression, and she finally she went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, my mother was heartbroken, but she didn't- we didn't want to believe that they killed right away, so my mother was sending us, where did they send the transport and if she can send packages, and they said of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, my mother was sending packages in the unknown and she had long been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Who knows, we don't know how she got killed and so that was less one. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Then they were moving us <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they took us out from our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they put us in like not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> yet, in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They just made our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> smaller and smaller and they put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Let me just go back a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When the war began in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , what are your first memories? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">How soon did the Germans come into your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Right in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They marched in and we didn't even know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They marched in about two weeks later, because at that time I forgot to tell you, my mother sent me for vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She said go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to your aunt's. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She wants you to have a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the war, they started about 5:00 in the morning they were calling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the war, the war, 5:00 in the morning, the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">A war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we didn't really know what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I said I'm going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I want to be with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My aunt, that was my father's sister, said no they're going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It's going to take a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You're better off to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> than to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I said, no I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So, she put me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that I was with the German soldiers in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the beginning because Polish soldiers were going one way and German soldiers were going the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We didn't even know what's going on because I was never in a war and how did I know how a war is going to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Finally I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my sister was not far, in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> living, my older sister with her husband and that child, and she had a maid, her name was Stasha and I went to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I started screaming Stasha, Stasha, early in the morning about 5:00, 6:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, she opened the big <span class="DLF">gate</span> , because it was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with <span class="DLF">gates</span> , and so she opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and she said quiet, everybody is asleep, but my sister heard and she said what are you doing here and I said, "It's a war." </span><span class="sentence" id="103">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they didn't know yet that it's a war, but in no time did soldiers start marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And it was a time that they were -- the Germans were grabbing older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They were shooting from the <span class="DLF">street</span> young people, and cripples and anybody they can find, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Like bearded Jews, you know with beards and with the Jewish you know, those curls by the ears, and so they were telling him to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , to lick the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with the tongue or they said, I don't have anything to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with, so they said wash it with your shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, anyway, it was a terrible thing, but we never knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Then they told us we have to move together, together in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but we for a little while we stayed in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my sister had a maid and she was part of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , standing and the Germans used to come and they asked if there were any Jews, and she couldn't speak German so she said, "No, Jews," so they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But we were in the <span class="DLF">window</span> watching what's going on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and we saw all our neighbors a lot of them came out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they told them to make a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and everybody was working hard to make the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and they laid around, they told them to stay around the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , to stand up, and that's what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">A very nice, I don't remember her name, a lady with a little girl, she was about five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">She was holding the baby with her and they told them to stay with the Germans with the backs and they were shooting from the back in the heads or whatever and they were falling into the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , into the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Was this right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Right in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They were falling and she was holding on to that little baby and she was killed and the baby, and after a while in full blocks and lots and lots of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I don't remember how many it was at that time, but a lot of people fell into that <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and that little baby came out after about five or ten minutes, from under the mother because they shoot her in the back of the head, so the little baby was she was holding on her so she wasn't hurt, and she came out from under the mother's body and she was begging them on the knees please don't kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I want to live, and they killed her just straight on her -- and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">This we all saw and my nephew said you see what they're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">At that time he was about five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He said, "I don't want to be killed like this." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And so, 1t was over and we cried and we said this is going to be our end. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">At that time, I worked already for the Germans, the SS, the German engineers, and I used to be Ruzia, but they called me Pauline. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They gave me the name Pauline that was easier for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Sometimes they called me Rozamunda or you know all kinds of names, but I worked for the Germans and my mother used to take my sister's children and we used to work; all of us, and my child and she used to babysit my mother, for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My mother at that time was about 45 or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I don't know what year my mother was born, and she was watching the children and we were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">One time I said I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they're killing people there, and the SS men said no you're not going because you'll only get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He was a very nice SS man and he wasn't in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He was a civilian SS, and my mother gave me the baby and said here you run away with the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He said take the baby, and I'm going to bring you milk for the baby, and he helped me and he was standing over me and he was crying and he said, "I have children, too, and I don't know what's going to happen when the war ends with my children." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They were afraid for themselves, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So, this passed by and they started moving us again, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  I'm just a little confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">When the Germans came in, you were sent to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had to have camp cards, like a passport, that we are working and we are registered to work, because if you're not registered, you didn't get bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So, you had to be registered, and we used to go all out to work.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="187">We met one nice and his name was Philip. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don't know the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He used to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He used to put when they say he used to come and say they are going to make a raid today, you know, like they're going to kill a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They are going to raid the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and so he said let me take you all go into the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , you know where the potatoes are high. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So, he put us in the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and he said I'm going to watch and I'm going to see where they are and I'm going to tell you when to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, the Germans were very smart and very clever, and they used to go around and looking for people like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They knew that everybody is trying to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So, he watched them, and he used to show us quietly don't get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Just stay there, and he was like a means he was the watcher, a watch guard for them, but he helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He helped us a lot in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They had a little more freedom to do that, the , and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They weren't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But, they were bad enough because we weren't used to a life like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But, you know from the worst they were the better ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So, they moved us again, and I moved out from my mother to a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They gave me a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her husband and child and another guy, another family lived next door and they made an . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Do you know what that is? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They told us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and they were cleaning up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so we all went to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , but the contribution of people, so many they can put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , that they had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They did the amount of people, it was over, so they sent some people back. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then when we came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , whoever they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So, we went into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we didn't even know who lived there, and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady, maybe 100 years old in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> crying that she doesn't have food, and that she doesn't know where her family is and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I was with my little baby at that time, yet still, and I was breast feeding her and I didn't have anything in my breast how to feed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We kept the baby quiet and my cousin was with me with her boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He was six years old and my cousin's husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Then the middle of the night, it was too dark, maybe 4 o'clock in the morning, we were going back quietly and we saw blood all over the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It was like a <span class="DLF">war field</span> with people who I knew were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> all over, and we saw a German on a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He was Gestapo or SS officer, a very high rank officer and he said "What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was quiet already, just, you know, once in a while we heard a shot someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So, he asked us what happened here and we said, "We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They killed us all." </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And he said, "Tell your people -- I never knew who he was -- "Tell your people that I am ashamed of our race." </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And he was a high rank German. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He told us tell the people so we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we said so what can you say. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so we had to lock the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and my cousin went to the next door neighbor for the <span class="DLF">gate</span> -- locking the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , it was a big like a piece of iron, you know to put an iron on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">In the meantime, he went in there and he called us all and he said, "Come in, come in, you're going to see something." </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Fourteen people were shot through the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">My two aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">One aunt was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She was looking something in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and she opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and she was with her head looking into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and she was shot, I suppose in the back of her head and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> was full of her blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">One of my aunts was sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the corner, with her tongue out, shot to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">That was my cousin's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">My mother's brother's wife, and so it was a full <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of dead people, fourteen people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">All of a sudden I hear somebody calling my name, and one girl was moaning because they shot her in an eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They said she's too pretty to shoot her so they just shoot her eye out, which she died a while later, but the woman who came out from under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , they were all standing or sitting or just so the woman was my neighbor and she came out from under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> dripping in blood, and she said, I run the first under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and they couldn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They just shot the next person who was after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I said, "Come out" my cousin said, "Come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You're going to be with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She said, "No, I'm afraid they're going to kill me." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she went back under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Finally, you know, we persuade her to come out and we said go and wash yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Look how you look. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She was soaking in blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So, that was then my mother knew what was someplace else and she sent the maid and she said to Anera (ph), she said go and see what's with my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">She came to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and it was I had a candle on because we were afraid to put the lights on and so she said she came back to my mother and she said I think in Ruzia's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there's a little candle so she must be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So, my father came with a blanket and he came for me and when he saw me he fainted because I looked like -- he couldn't recognize me because we went through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was not a night, it was a <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">What we saw, and that's always in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I never told my children anything about those things, and my father took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mother said you're not going anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You're staying with us until they move us further. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So, then I said no I'm going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Soon after my baby died, because I didn't give her milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I gave her water. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I didn't have anything to give her, and so we --

<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  You were still living in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes, but then I came back and it was '41, because they took the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> together and we marched, children, old and young, whatever was left, we marched to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">was never there in my life and we marched 21 kilometers with my sister at that time had a boy and he was eight years already and the little girl was two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">She had a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, when they told us to march, so we had a woman who washed our clothes for us and so she said send Sanrush (ph) to me and he said "No Mommy, I will not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I'm going with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And he said, "I don't want to be shot like all the children on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , because when you're not going to be here she's going to throw me out and we're going to wind up dead on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So, he went and he walked 21 kilometers, an eight year old boy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother, my father, my brother, my one sister, because one was already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, we walked and I helped carry

class="sentence" id="289">It was a dirty little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with -- it wasn't even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> like and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We went in with a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I don't know who that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In the same day, a German, an SS man, but I worked for him, he was- | worked in an logger, that means a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we were going there for

class="sentence" id="307">Maybe by you're going back to work for Robert, you can save us, and we're going to start hiding ourselves in here by the time maybe you can help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So, I didn't want to go and I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I said, "Mother, I don't want to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He said, "you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="311">My brother took me there and he said, "You go with Robert," and he was standing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and the other side of the cane, he always had a cane to hit somebody, so he pulled my neck to him and he said, "You come here," and he took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he said, "You're going back, because they needed 75 people back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to clean up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">My brother and my father and my mother and my sister and the children stayed in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So, my brother started going for those cards, for the passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, the Pollack who made that passport saw that the Germans are you know the bosses and he said -- and my brother paid him 3,000 slotas, that means like $3,000, and that time it was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So, he said, you better get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I don't have papers for you and I'm not going to make them. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I have the money and you go out, and if you're not going to get out, I'm going to call the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, my brother ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He ran away and he came down, and by that time, my mother and sister and children were hidden in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They found them there, I don't know, because I wasn't there anymore, because they took me back to my <span

class="sentence" id="329">I'm from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">He said I'm not going to kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I am not to kill you, I'm in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like you are, and I'm going to save you as much as I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He said I'm a Jew like you are and we're going to hide out together, and when he came out nobody was around anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">All of them are gone and I by the time I was in in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , working and my father was one of the workers, a Pollack, came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and said he wants to see me and I run to <span class="DLF">gate</span> and I said what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He said, your mother was killed.

know what the Germans were looking there for and I said I'm going, and they hid me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I went and my father and brother and my brother- in-law were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So, I brought them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don't know how, but I brought my brother- in-law and father back and my brother said I am going to wait maybe still he is going to give me the papers and he waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">A few days later my brother came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and he fainted by the

<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  Different, much, much different. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Hannah she was a very clean lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">She loved cleanliness and so am I and we were afraid that we were going to get like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They had malaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">They had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They had and that everything together and besides everything from the dirt we had sores from the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">If somebody didn't wash, they just died from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">They went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> with those sores, but Hannah, , used to wake me up in the middle of the night and she said you know what, I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that's called they wash clothes and water 1s dripping a little in the middle of the night we went out with her because we weren't allowed, but we sneaked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I'm always forgetting I always say <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we always sneaked out and we cleansed ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Thanks to her she gave me the courage she said come on, come on let's go because you like to be clean and so do I. So, we washed ourselves with that little drop of water, we shared it. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, that was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was a terrible, they gave us five minutes to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and we were sitting around and you know, number one, it wasn't a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with <span class="DLF">holes</span> and you could sit there for five minutes and they opened the water in the morning for five minutes you have to get to the water and wash your face and drink a little water and go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They start counting us going out to work we had to be all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They count us. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They separate us who is going where to what work to what <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and we had to march out by the music, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">The music was waiting for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  Who was playing the music?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  People from-- they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they asked them if they know how to play and they gave them instruments and they told them to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They cry and play because what else can you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  What were the actual physical conditions like? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">How did they differ from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidanek</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Was it more comfortable, less comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  Less, less, it was worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">First of all they made selections every few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They looked at you naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they looked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth, exactly like cows like cattle, they're buying cows to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So, they looked us through from the front and from the back and they went around us like you know looking all over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">This was selections, called selections, and they selected if you were still good to work they send you straight ahead and if not they took you out on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So, you knew that this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So one time in a selection like this, I had a friend from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and her name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I forgot her name and last night I was thinking and I said you know, I think I know the name, it's , and she was heavy, and I was a skinny girl and she was very, very heavy and she lost a lot of weight and she said but I'm still heavier than you. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You are bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">You see sometimes on television those thin boned people. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">We call them 5a is a piece of gold, nothing else, just bones or a musselman. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">A musselman is completely to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He couldn't walk any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">That was a musselman, and that she said to me I was going before her and she was behind me and she said, you know let's change <span class="NPIP">places</span> because when they look at you they are going to take you to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and I have here on my arm a wound and she said put the clothes because we should keep the clothes in our right hand, not the left and she said change it and you cover this because even with a little thing like this they took you to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">So, and she said I'm going to walk before you and you after. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They're going to look at me not you they're not going to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">She was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">A fat person when you lose weight your skin hangs, and she went through and they took her aside and they took down her number and I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">She went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , but she was working with us for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">They took down her number and every day they're going to call me now, they're going to call me today, and I said why did you do that for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="824">You could live and I could go, and she no, I wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You're going to stay here and she gave me her piece of bread and she said you take care of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So, anyway, after two weeks they called her name and she went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and I went through like they didn't see me, like she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And I always have her on my conscious that maybe she was saving me that maybe she went instead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I have that on my conscious many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So, I come out of there and she was calming me down, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I want to go, I want you to live and I wanted to go I have nothing to live for. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Maybe you'll find your father and your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Maybe you're still going to have anybody to live for. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So, she kissed me goodbye and she gave me the bread and she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">They used make a , they used to take all our clothes and put it, in the winter time, and like a big huge I don't know, it was like a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> with water, and they put something in it to kill the lice and all the insects. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So, they gave you back those clothes and you had to go to work, so you put them on wet until you walk out to work it as frozen on you, but this was our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">You asked me how different it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It was completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Then when we came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you smelled the flesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">You smelled burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">You walked out, you saw on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like each had a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We had Loger A, Loger B, Loger C. In one there were all gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">In the other one were children or Gentiles, not only Jews and then the third one was anybody who was a little crippled had you know a hunch back or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">That's a cripple. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So every time he came back from work another one was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">No more children, no more playing, no more singing and they didn't like homosexuals and they killed them all too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">QUESTION:  So, they would liquidate a <span class="DLF">block</span> at a time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Yes, all of a sudden you would see it's missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">It's not there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Then we saw the fire going. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I lived closed to a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">The smell was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">The screams were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">You heard them screaming going in, not because they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">They didn't tell them they were going to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They just told them that they were going to go for a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they were going to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But still, when they went in, one pushed the other the mother wants to go with the child, it was terrible screams.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  How did you learn what that was, the smoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  We knew who was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">You know when fresh transports came from freedom -- not really freedom, they were better off wherever they were like at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> or in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so they had a little flesh on them, so when the flesh was burning you saw only smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">You didn't see a fire, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">The flames you didn't see, only smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">When we were burning, like those musselmens, like what they didn't like, you saw flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So, we knew that those are the freedom people and those are our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We knew who was who, burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  How did you first learn what was going on in there at all, though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  The minute they brought you in and they send you to work and you saw before people were coming in to work it was just a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Or they brought them in not a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding spoons on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , bones, heads, we saw heads with hair to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We saw because I don't think they buried them very deep and they were buried -- you know we could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We were walking on bones and hair, on heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  Do you think these were things that didn't get burned properly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  No, they didn't have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> finished yet, so they just killed them and they just covered them with I think a very, they were not covered much and we found like spoons and forks and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We were lucky we found those. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">We had something to eat with because we ate with the fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It was not civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">It was, I think in the old ages, they had a better civilization that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Germans looked us over naked like pieces of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we weren't women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  How do you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  Because I worked later in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we were putting in -- it was very bitter what we put in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  What was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  I don't remember the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It was like a powder and you put that powder into the soup and we at that so a woman wasn't a woman and a man wasn't a man either, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  They didn't tell you what 1t was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  You just saw the results?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We didn't have periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We were young because how you know how we never being there we didn't think about if we're going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">We didn't know we were going to live through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">If we would live through it if we're going to be able to have children, to bear children. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Never never in life because we didn't even have -- I was married already. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I had a child already. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">There, is I said I have a child and I had a husband and they used to say I was nuts because I looked like a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We were bones, no breasts, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They took away our dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They took away everything you have in life, and we didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We just didn't want to suffer, but we didn't care, but we did suffer because they saw we used to go to work every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">At first you used to work in the outside commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So, we used to go out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">In the <span class="DLF">fields</span> we found a row of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">It was a jewel. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">In the outside commander we were in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">When we found a row of potatoes we ate it like it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">No water, no nothing, with the dirt and everything, so and it was so good that I used to say if I'm going to live ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">If I'm going to live, after a dinner if I'm going to have enough dinner that's going to be my desert. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">It was so delicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  What kind of work were you doing in the outside commando?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  In the outside commando I don't know what this is called in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">We called it . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">If you took that in your hand, your body burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">That's a reed, like a burning reed and from this they made soups in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so we used to pick those. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">A whole day with our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">We felt that our hands were so swollen after a day, and we brought that into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to cook the soups from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Sometimes we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamps</span> , because it was swampy. </span><span class="sentence" id="917"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was swampy and we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to the knees or higher and we were pulling those reeds from there and we are putting those reeds they gave us to fill after the day after we picked them, they gave us pieces of like socks and we put them for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">That's supposed to be our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> , but those reeds are very sharp on the ends and they cut our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We were bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">We were swollen, but that was our job and we wanted to live, or you couldn't kill yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">You didn't have any sources to kill yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">How, people were running to the electric wires or shot when you were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So, and I think we were chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We didn't have the guts to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">QUESTION:  There was a lot of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Lots of it because you didn't have the guts. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">You wanted to die but you didn't know how and so this 1s --
QUESTION:  You must have also wanted to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  Must be. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I remember why I wanted to live, because I knew that my father and brother are free and maybe some day we are going to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And I knew that I have a lot of uncles in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I never knew my uncles even my father didn't remember them and they were living in <span class="REGION">Cleveland Ohio</span> and they were in American and I thought maybe the American Army will come and they are going to bombard the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and some are going to get killed so it doesn't matter but at least somebody is going to get saved, you know be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">That's what we did in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Then they were selecting people all the time in the morning where to go and they selected me to . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Did you hear about and they selected me and Hannah and the same to work and that was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">We were you know <span class="NPIP">inside</span> closed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">We were segregating clothes, which ones were good, which were bad or finding gold and diamonds and had to put them in boxes because they were watching you like hawks.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  From all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Everybody who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We found, first of all we had to check all the seams in the dresses if there are not diamonds there. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">They were watching you what you're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We had to throw the diamonds in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We had everything put bundles made big, big bundles and put them together and put them up you know in bunches and right away people came in and took them to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they were transported, the good ones, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And the bad one we had to cut and tear into pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So, that's what we did in ;
QUESTION:  How did you get chosen for that?</span></p>

the waves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Fear teaches you everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">From fear you know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">There's not a thing that you don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">So, I start making her hair and she said I'm going to show my boyfriend my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">She's going to show if he likes it and he said it's wunderbar, it's wunderbar so that's all, so I became her private beautician and manicurist, but she said to me you are going to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , that means we didn't peel potatoes, we were only that was a machine that it was like scraping the potatoes with the dirt and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">In the beginning I didn't work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> so my girlfriend Hannah, no another girlfriend used to make pancakes, no potato pancakes threw them in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> there and with the sand and the dirt and everything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you couldn't chew them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">It was in the teeth, it was an awful feeling so we were swallowing them to fill the stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So, she cooked a little soup and she brought me up to eat a little soup, but when I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> so Hannah wasn't there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">They took from -- no Hannah was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We all were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Going out to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> she wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">So, then other girls start coming into from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , from wherever they took them, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the Russians came very close to there so they had to evacuate very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So the evacuation came very fast and they brought them 1n bunches to . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">So, Hannah came with the next transport with me and other girls and that Sarah Goldberg what I tell you she was there too, and I worked already in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">After a while

and I came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with a white, I was wearing a white uniform in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> cooked for the Germans too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So they picked me in the day time they took me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> where the Germans ate to be a waitress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">It was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So, I had to wear a white uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So, I came out when a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came in and I looked who was there and I saw who is from our girls who 1s from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and said Ruzia it's me and so I said it's good to see you and we hugged and I said who is with you and she said Sarah is with me and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">They are all with me and another Rushka is with me an I said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">That Sarah thought I was a nurse so she didn't even come close to me, but when she hears that I'm in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they said what are you doing here, what are you doing here, I said I am in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I am working as a cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So she wants to be my friend but I had ten girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">We are together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">We came all together and I said to Hannah, Bessie's mother, I said you are going to be the supervisor of the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">You're going to feed all ten girls that left after that terrible, terrible what happened to us and you know terrible deal that happened to us and we are alive and I will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">So, she said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I said put them together, tell me how many are there and I somehow I was going to steal the food from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I am going to feed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">In the meantime I was transferred to block one, because there whoever worked for the Germans had to be clean and that was the first block was for the clean people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And there I found a woman and a little boy. </span><span class="sentence"
