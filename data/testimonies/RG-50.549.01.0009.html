<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Do you have her name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Do you remember her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  | don’t, | remember her first name, Hannah, but | don’t think | ever knew her last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">| don’t think | ever knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">She was very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">She was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">She was more like a sister to me than a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So we left, with the idea to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> and she really thought that maybe her child is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">She wants to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Now | wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because the last thing that we said to each other Nesse Godin 9 December 14, 1995 Page 9 when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , we have to make a meeting point, back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So this | had back in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And | thought after all, we had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Maybe I'll find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So that was my plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So there we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">You couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , say | want to buy a ticket to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Didn't work that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">See you are very young, | don’t know if you understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That first it, it wasn't even, the war hadn't even ended yet, so a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military trucks</span> were going east and they were going west and they were going south. </span><span class="sentence" id="22"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trains</span> were going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The Russians were looting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and taking machinery back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So you hitchhiked. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You hitchhiked on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They said, “You want to go up to this and this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we'll take you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Then you have to wait for a next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And this is the way we arrived in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , like through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> while we were traveling people were telling us that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there is already <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Christian relief, Red Cross, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">All of a sudden we were called refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, we were very glad to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">When we came Nesse Godin 10 December 14, 1995 Page 10 there, there was a big shelter on 66. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">| remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , there were big billboards. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Posters like, and it was divided by <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and divided each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> more or less by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And you, if let’s say if you were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> and surrounding and surround <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , that’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was called and surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So | saw quite a few names there and | wrote down my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">That was in case somebody of your family comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That's how you got connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You see when | tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but this was the way you found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Your name and where you are staying, whether you are continuing, whether you are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And that particular, that shelter was, there was a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> with many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on, see in Europe, some people don't understand that especially in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , they used to have a whole <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> maybe six, seven <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And you had to go in through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and it was closed for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And so we were assigned in that same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Now all that night | thought to myself, why didn’t | write down my name within eyesight. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">| wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody's going to bend down and look for my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">| was 17, | wasn't too bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And | could hardly wait for the next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">| said, “I'll put it Nesse Godin 11 December 14, 1995 Page 11 on again, that’s alright, nobody's going to say why do you have it twice.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And, as | was writing my name, Nesa Galperin, that was my name N,E,S,A G,A,L,P,E,R,I,N. Galperin. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And a woman said to me, “What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galperin</span> , are you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="53">She was standing right next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And why did she ask that way? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Just if you come of European background, you can understand, they usually said, “| am Galperin, the, the doctor Galperin, the lawyer Galperin, the shoemaker.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My parents had a dairy business, | said, “| am Galperin from the dairy business from the , from the dairy business.” </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And the woman looked at me and she said, “No, Nesa, that’s you, you look so terrible, | would never recognize you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And, and she said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">| thought to myself, isn’t she crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Everybody looks terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And when | looked at her, | recognized the lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">She was a very nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But before the war, everybody called her the, the , the person that is not all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She had some mental problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And next thing out of that woman’s mouth was, “Oh, | was with your mother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She's in this and this <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> in this and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And | said, “You were with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My mother was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galepf</span> (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtoodruff</span> (ph).” </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She said, “Yes but then there was another selection and they took the people in the sixties away to the left,” and asked, she was maybe in her thirties and my mother was in the forty, she said, “They took us again and send us to labor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Now as young as | was, | thought can | believe a crazy woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Nesse Godin 12 December 14, 1995 Page 12 Always people said the crazy so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So | didn’t know but | thought, | said, “Well, maybe | should check it out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So | go up to the lady, to this Hannah, who is my, whose ward | am and | said to her, “We have to go back to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="74">She looked at me, she says, “Child you're crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Nobody goes back, everybody goes forward.” </span><span class="sentence" id="76">| said, “But somebody told me that my mother is there, near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">She said, “I love you but how can | go with you to your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">| want to go to my own child.” </span><span class="sentence" id="79">| said, “But you have to go with me, you have the document.” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So she took the piece of paper, she tore it to pieces, she said to me, “Go over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , tell them you're 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And you'll have your own document.” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So | went over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">| told them I’m 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">| need a, a document. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They gave me the document. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Now everybody’s traveling one way, I’m traveling the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Everybody’s going east, I’m going west. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Some Russian soldier felt sorry for me, gave me his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And it was May already. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">| remember being on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and hearing a lot of shooting and thinking that we are being bombed but that was the celebration of VE Day and | arrived at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , found the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , walk in there and | see women from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and | recognize them, some woman that had <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , another one that had a <span class="BUILDING">dry goods store</span> , another one that had, that sold buttons and thread and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And | look at with my eyes and they say, “Who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And | say again, Nesse Godin 13 December 14, 1995 Page 13 “?’</span><span class="sentence" id="94">m Galperin from the <span class="BUILDING">dairy business</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="95">Oh, Nesa, your mom heard that you were alive and she heard that you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and she went there to look for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So you can see, this isn’t just my story, how we survivors went looking for families back and forth, back and forth, hearing rumors, trying to find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It took me about maybe another two weeks or three weeks to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Nesse, tell me what you remember of your feelings when it was then confirmed that your mother was alive and you could trust these reports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Oh, my, it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">| just thought in my heart that maybe | was kind to, to some older person. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">When you are 17 and you think of somebody 46 or 47, it’s old. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| just thought maybe God helped to my prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Maybe God paid me back because | was kind to some older ladies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it, you, it just undescribable, undescribable, that | felt so grateful, so grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And those remember asking me was their child with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And unfortunately there wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">| was with some people not even from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , just a few from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> were with me in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And when | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> back, yeah, we human beings are really wonderful, a wonderful thing on the earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">When we came, when | came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> even out of the survivors there was a welcoming committee at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">| came down in the three weeks that | wasn’t there or four weeks, such a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">| didn’t have to ask where is the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There were Nesse Godin 14 December 14, 1995 Page 14 women saying already, “Where you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I’m going to help you, there’s a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And a woman with red hair, | don’t remember her name, came over, she said, “Nesa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="116">| said, “How do you know me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She says, “Ooh, | know, you were here, you went back, I'll take you to your mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And | just went with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">| figured even if she takes me to any mother, I'll just go. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And | don’t Know how | walked up three or four <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> because as | told you my feet were so raw, | could hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">| shuffled my feet and there | came up and the only thing | remember of that reunion is this woman knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, “Frau Galperin, Mrs. Galperin, | brought you your daughter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She didn’t even wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened up and there wasn’t any electricity, it was a candle burning, and there was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">She looked like my mother and she didn’t run to grab me and hug me. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She looked at me and | couldn’t understand, why this cold reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And she said to me, “Okay, take off your junk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="128">| had, my face was wrapped because this was still swollen and a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in there draining parts and no hair, | still had that little hair and that was wrapped with a rag. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">With that big . . . [</span><span class="sentence" id="130">end of side 1 of tape 1] My mother said to me, “Take off your, your junk, your wrappings, your like was saying, just take them off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So as | started to unwrap, there, there, the scarf and took off the coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And you see when | was a little child | had a tracheotomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">| had measles and | had some infection and when my mother saw this little thing here on my neck, on Nesse Godin 15 December 14, 1995 Page 15 my actually, right here in the middle of my neck, she grabbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She said, “My child, | didn't recognize you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You see she looked the same because she was 46, you don't change that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But me as a little girl growing up and looking different and, and all this, being so skinny and so ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Now for weeks and weeks | didn’t go down those <span class="DLF">steps</span> cause | couldn't walk them down and | always wondered how did | ever go up those <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Now we were very fortunate to find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">There we were, a mother and a daughter, not too many survivors at that point had already someone of their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Some did but not too many, especially a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Forty-six was considered old, not too many at that age survived the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Now we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> not knowing what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Nesse can! </span><span class="sentence" id="144">go back and...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Because it’s so moving, | imagine that what had kept you going was your, your wish to survive, to be with your mother and brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And | imagine it kept your mother going, the hope to be there for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I, | just wonder, did you hold each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Would you, would you sleep soundly holding onto each other at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  When, you see all through the Holocaust, it’s true the hope helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But to very sincere with you, there was no formula for surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Many times people will say to me, “Oh, Nesse, you're a strong lady, that’s why you survived the Holocaust.” </span><span class="sentence" id="152">| was Nesse Godin 16 December 14, 1995 Page 16 a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">| wasn’t, and somebody will say, “You must have been intelligent.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Now how intelligent was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">| was just a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It, | survived maybe by the grace of God, maybe by sheer luck, maybe by the kindness of women that held my hand and did give me hope or gave them their own bite of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Or maybe women that took straw and wrapped my body so | would keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">| didn’t understand that straw is a insulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">| really don’t know what made me survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">| really don’t know what made my mother survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">My mother always, when she died 27 years ago here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , she alway, at that time people didn’t take oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">| wished they would have had her oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">She was telling me how many times, even from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , she was selected to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And by some miracle she was left or she was overlooked or they decided that she can still work. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">At one point she said to me, “They told another woman to take off the shoes and give it to her and the woman went there and she, she, she was still alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we don’t know how but when we were reunited, we became really like one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We, | didn't even want my mother to leave that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">She used to have to go down to bring up some food or get in that shelter some food or, or food stamps or whatever we, like little nut foods, there was a little ticket to go to get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">| was always afraid that if she leaves me that | won’t see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And from the day of liberation, no from the day of reunion with my Nesse Godin 17 December 14, 1995 Page 17 mother, ‘til the day she died, we were not separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">She chose not, never to marry again, she lived with us, with my husband and | until the day she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And | cherished her, everybody knows | respected her. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">| cherished her and the day she died, | thanked God for giving me a gift of so many years after the Holocaust to have a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Many people thought | was crazy at her funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You see now | have a tear when | think of my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But at her funeral, | stood there when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> was being lowered and | said, people didn’t want me to watch how they lower the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They said you’re supposed to stay aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">| said, “No, | have to stay here because | was blessed as a survivor of the Holocaust to have a mother survive and die by a disease.” </span><span class="sentence" id="179">| know where she was laid, | know I'll put the stone over her <span class="DLF">grave</span> , | know I'll be able to come and visit her which | do very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">| go constantly for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">| don’t even know where his ashes are. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So you ask me that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We were inseparable and | was lucky that my husband Jack just adored my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He really was, he lost his whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He cannot even listen to me speak about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And he was very kind and glad to have her and we cherished her. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Anyway, to continue what happened afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So one day, my mother comes upstairs after going to look get some food or some clothing, | don't remember and she tells me that she ran into a gentleman that was with the Soviet Army by the name of Tabreeshock (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="189">My father’s younger sister, her Nesse Godin 18 December 14, 1995 Page 18 married name was Tabreeshock (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="190">This gentleman told my mother that he stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and his cousin who was my uncle by marriage and my aunt, my father’s sister succeeded to escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , just as the, before the Germans marched in to the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That they have returned back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and they hope as Polish citizens to, they had, there was a certain law, that you were allowed to live , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilner</span> (ph), that’s we Jewish people call , If youre a Polish citizen you were allowed to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And most people did not want to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had the dream at that time to, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So he told us that he knows that in a very short time, he doesn't Know it'll take a week or two weeks or three weeks that his cousin and, and, he’s, my aunt who's, he’s cousin to by marriage are going to try to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We shouldn't go nowhere, we'll be reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , my uncle, my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They had a boy that was twelve years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My uncle’s best friend, he’s my, his best friend’s brother and the brother's best friend, so there are three single men with my uncle and my aunt and that little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So we are already a family unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we Nesse Godin 19 December 14, 1995 Page 19 go? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Where should we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We get already messages that the men were liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We hear already that the men that were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtoodruff</span> (ph) that came with us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and the camps of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So we are waiting to hear maybe someone of the men survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Eventually come a few gentlemen that were liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that are from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">What they did, they decided to send out a few people to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , see if, and tell the women don't go back to the Soviet Union, don't go to Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Try to come to the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So and so they came with list telling who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">On that list was my brother's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we knew this, one of this gentleman and he said you, to my mother, “Your son said if | find you, try every which way to come to the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Why was the aim to go to the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">My mother had a sister that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> And if we would be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American Zone</span> , we would be able to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So here we are, all this group of people, not knowing what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So one day, my mother says to me, “You know, Nesa, we two women alone, we couldn't do all this traveling.” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We couldn't, you still had to go a little bit across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , there was no really regulations about the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But still you have to take a chance, you had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , you had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">She says, “We two women alone couldn't really manage all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">One of us have to get married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And | looked at my mother and | thought she has me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Why Nesse Godin 20 December 14, 1995 Page 20 does she want to get married? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But the next thing out of my mother’s mouth was, “My child, | had a wonderful husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But you, it’s true youre very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Maybe you should get married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So | looked at her, | said, “Where do | get a husband?” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And she said, “Look at those guys, three guys, single guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The friend of the uncle’s, his brother and his friend.” </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Well | looked at the three guys and | said, “Well this one is too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This one is too short and maybe this one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So my mother said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Now | don’t know how Jack and | got married, | really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and | never kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I’m his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And so, we were already like a, a threesome, a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But | really didn't, legally, | was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on we had the religious wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So here we are, trying to find out how can we get to the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So everybody says not a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">There is a, the Jewish agent, he’s helping out people to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Once you get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had four <span class="REGION">zones</span> : The <span class="REGION">Russian Zone</span> , the <span class="REGION">French Zone</span> , the <span class="REGION">English Zone</span> , the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So to go to the <span class="REGION">Russian Zone</span> was no problem because we were in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And we didn’t have any luggage, we didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So we took a walk and we were in the <span class="REGION">American Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And when we registered there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and eventually through the Jewish Agency, people came and helped you Nesse Godin 21 December 14, 1995 Page 21 to go to wherever you had family. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And my brother was already at that point in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And in October of 1945, we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">At that point, we had separated from the rest of the people because we were privileged to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> because my brother was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Would you tell me the name of this brother and which one...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  It was [talkover].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  That's my oldest brother, Yurhaskel (ph) and he was liberated in one of the camps of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> they were all put in the Feldafing Displaced Person Camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">When we arrived, they were already, | think they were liberated in May, maybe | don't know exactly whether May or June that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> was formed, but when we arrived in October, it was pretty much organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Now my aunt and my uncle, they were assigned to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> ‘cause <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> was pretty crowded at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But if you had family you were allowed to go and be reunited so this is why we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And we, we registered in the, as soon aS we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You have to register every, within the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , police. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It's funny because | still have the, found the little document where | registered that | came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And that’s how we wound up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Nesse Godin 22 December 14, 1995 Page 22
QUESTION:  And tell me about the reunion with your brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  The reunion with my brother was different than with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Because, because of us knowing that he was alive and because of him knowing that we were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And because of him trying to make arrangements for us to get us permission to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Although we didn't see each other, but by knowing that we were alive, it wasn't like when | walked in and there was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Naturally it was very emotional but not like you got surprised, you see somebody, you didn't know they were alive.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  Well | tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">| spoke to some survivors and they said to me, “How could you have a child after all that that happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Weren't you afraid that somebody will come and kill them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="826">| didn’t and | don’t know why | didn’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Maybe, | never thought that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">| was overprotective to my children, I'm still overprotective. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Now Nesse Godin 55 December 14, 1995 Page 55 you, you, it may be stupid to say on the tape but I'll say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">You see this stupid crocodile there? </span><span class="sentence" id="831">| always, when my kids go away on the beautiful vacation, | say watch out for the crocodiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And my daughter in law who’s a new daughter in law, she’s lovely woman, to, my son was married and divorced and remarried and she said, “There’s no crocodiles where we are going.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And | said to her, “It's not really the crocodiles, it's the memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">It’s the experience in life that | went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It’s the fears and anxieties and | call them crocodiles.” </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So she came back and brought me a crocodile there, so, this is very normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">If you experience something, whether a dog bites you or a disease, you're scared of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">You're scared of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And we survivors are all overprotective of, for our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Always thinking something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Don't go here, don't go there and in reverse, our children are super kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">They always are afraid to do wrong because they don’t want to hurt the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">When | was very young and talk with my son, he always said, “| never wanted you to cry, mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">| always thought if I'll be bad and you will cry, | will hurt you and you were hurt so much.” </span><span class="sentence" id="845">The most of the survivors are overprotective of the children and in turn, the children are super achievers because they want to do good to their parents because they suffered so much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  Because my aunt said she had enough pain losing two sisters and two brothers and she doesn't to diminish the joy of having a sister, a niece and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Now she was right too, but, again, people come to us, survivors and they will say, “How come you didn’t talk about your experiences?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Many of us were willing to talk but Nesse Godin 67 December 14, 1995 Page 67 no one would listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So after being there for two weeks, we came into our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was at 529 LaMont (ph) Street in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">one bedroom apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We were my mom, my husband, myself and the two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> that someone had given to us for Ed cause he was a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">My mom and my daughter Panina (ph) was three and half years old, slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">W were so glad to have two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> inside of the, cause in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> we still had to go to <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , we shared with other people a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , so this was really something special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And we just couldn't count enough our blessings, to be here but then reality came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Reality came that we are in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> without professions, without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We couldn't sit there although in the paper it said that my aunt is going to support us but we couldn't expect them to support us and we started to hunt for jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">We were really not skilled although | learned a little bit at sewing, | didn’t know, | didn’t know how to make a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Maybe | knew how to sew a hem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Poor Jack, he was involved in the, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> working in that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , managing that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But what would he do here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He knew less English than | Knew cause he was working already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> while | was going a little bit to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">So this was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Lucky my aunt and my uncle knew some people that had a glass business and they gave Jack a job to Nesse Godin 68 December 14, 1995 Page 68 carry crates of glass, carry them out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , labor work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Natural when we say now 7/5 cents an hour, it may seem very little but that was minimum wage at that time, 1950, ‘51. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">We will came here the end of '50, 51. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And with me, because my mother was with us and she could take care of the children, | could go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So through talking to some neighbors in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , | was asked to come for an interview in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on <span class="DLF">Connecticut Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">It was called the King Needlework Services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And to, the lady was very kind, very compassionate, her name was Mrs. King and she really did not worry too much that | didn’t know how to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">She was willing to give me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And that’s how we started to earn our living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And continue our life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> bit by bit with the hope that we can give to our children a better life than we had.</span></p>
