<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I am Ruth Krautwirth Meyerowitz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in 19290 — June 23, 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> — what became Slovakian during the Second World War; and he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when he was about two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And he was, I'm sorry to say, in the Austrian Army during World War I. And my parents were married in 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My father had just started a business, and he was in leather good business. </span><span class="sentence" id="7"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> 1s — the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> — many Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , were in the leather good business actually, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And then during the war, he had to leave the business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span> and move, to move the business into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Was behind in the, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">commercial district</span> , behind the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I have a younger brother, four years younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He is now — he now lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I live in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And in 1933 — I have memories from the events, the chaotic events that went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 19— from 1933, probably 1932 on. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But, of course, the — I understand, going back into history, that there was a lot of continuous up— unrest in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from the end of the war actually and through the Depression and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But actually on account of the inflation. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But I'm, of course, was too young to know of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I have memories from when I was about two, three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The first thing that I remember, was that there was sort of unrest and fear in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And one day, my parents went out and left me with help. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I was worried because everything seemed so insecure all at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So and we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> about on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> which is probably is.... And I went out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and looked for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And of course, when you're that age I don't think you have any depth perception. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And there was a banner slung between the two <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> and to me it seemed like it was a <span class="DLF">barrier</span> that no one would be able to cross anymore, and I was very fearful that my parents would not be able to come back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was a banner; it was political banner that was put up by the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I don't know what, I don't remember what it said. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But that was my very first memory of Nazi, the rise of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My uncle, my father's youngest brother, was a budding reporter as they would say in today's jargon, and he worked for a German newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Apparently had written something or maybe, I don't know, maybe his political views were not anything the Nazis liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Anyway, he was hunted, hunted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was taken to a — he was, at first he was working on the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And one day my father — and I was three years old — my father told, told me that, “If some men come and asked you where Uncle Julius is, you should tell them that you had just seen him this morning or the night before or some such.” </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Because he wanted to sort of cool his <span class="DLF">trail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">If he had left by then, he was fleeing from the Nazis and made his way to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and sure enough some men came, and I was really itching to tell them that my uncle wasn't here, but thank God they never asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They just spoke to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They wanted to know where my uncle was, and he ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and they never caught him until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He was working in western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> and when the Nazis came in, of course he tried to make his way east, away from them, and he went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> and had an accident, had a broken leg and brought him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And of course by then the occupying Nazi, Nazi forces — the German army, knew who he was and they took him out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and took him to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and he was shot there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So they did eventually catch up with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So these were my very earliest memories of living in a police state in Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">When, of course in the very beginning they — the Nazis did now allow any money to be paid out or whatever foreign money or any monies were in Jewish bank accounts was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Of course they had to open the accounts again especially since my brother was getting money from out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> foreign exchange with better interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Which they were anxious to get in because they needed it, so it seemed that for a very short time life might be fairly normal in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It wasn't in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">There was a lot of beating and harassment of Jews of all kinds, but in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , it didn't quite begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I didn't feel it until much later, but gradually they encroached on our liberties. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was walking with my family on the side of a <span class="DLF">park</span> once, and a young boy on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> knocked me over and went over my knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He didn't break anything, but my parents were even afraid to go to the police and report it, report it to anyone because it would only have meant problems for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So since I wasn't seriously hurt they took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and nursed my knee and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">When, sometime ago, my family — my sons, my husband and I — went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on a sort of very bittersweet tour, we — I wanted to show them the <span class="NPIP">Jewish places</span> and the rich Jewish history, if anything could be found — the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that I remembered and the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that made sense within Jewish history to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we were walking from the last <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we had lived, on the way to where my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">This <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , incidentally, was a rather well-known <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The educational process 1s still being studied today. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They were very progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It's Philantropin — I don't know if you've heard of it but it was a really well known <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And anyway, there was a few blocks walk to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from my first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we passed a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that has been left standing, and it brought back a terrible memory of something that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was a little girl in my brother's class. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She was four years younger, I mean he's four years younger than I, so she was, must have been the same age as my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And she was, I don't know, maybe at the time eight or seven or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Her father had done something that the Nazis didn't like, and so rather than punish him outright, they took this little girl and had her sterilized, and then returned to the father. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that is, I mean, a much more terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Now that I have grandchildren and I see my sons having their daughters almost that age, this is a most terrible thing that you can do to a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It's worse than taking and chopping a parent's hand off or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we passed this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I told them the story and it was absolutely — they were absolutely stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I mean they had heard and read every-everything about the Holocaust and about the persecutions and all, but standing 1n front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where this actually went — where this girl actually had lived, it was really quite mind-boggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And of course eventually, everyone was killed anyway, but this was one of the terrible things that went on as the war progressed and as the war against the Jews progressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Actually the war against Jews didn't really start in Europe in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It started in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It became a hot war in 1933, but I think German history 1s, is full of war against Jews, cold and hot and in between.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Let's get back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">How, what were you doing this years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Many of the teachers left. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Many of them committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were disillusioned with what was, and they were afraid of the future and when I've gone back to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and I've seen some of their <span class="DLF">graves</span> and they are all, they all fall in this in a certain time period. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It must have been at one point the realization that everybody would be killed and people preferred to die in their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and by their own choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And so I do go the cemeteries and I recognize some of the names and I put a stone and I remember what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But, I did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and many of my friends left. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And then more and more restrictions were placed on Jewish teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were allowed — I mean — I guess they couldn't control that we were learning Hebrew and the Bible and Jewish history and.... But we were not allowed to play Jewish music by Jewish composers and it was very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My — when the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> stopped, my brother and I took violin lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Pretty bad, we were pretty bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But anyway when — after we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, my mother wanted us — to keep us busy I guess, to keep practicing. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And we were playing together the Barcarole from Tales of Hoffman and for some reason some Nazis, Gestapo men, came up to see us for I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they heard us scratch away on the violin and they asked us what we were playing, and we were afraid to say that this was by a Jewish composer. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Of course, Offenbach’ was not allowed to be played. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Neither was Mendelssohn’ and all the other Jewish composers or even if they were remotely related to Jewish composers. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Because I guess they figured I couldn't — we couldn't do much harm with our playing so they didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But that was one of the many harassments that went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was finally combined with the — another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we — one of the two <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> that had existed from — for at least 100 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I mean students had left, and there were very few left behind, and then of course some were sent out on transports into — we didn't know, but it was ostensibly, of course, for repatriation into the east or for settlement in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And of course that was not true, but we were told that that's what it ‘J acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach * Felix Mendelssohn was. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They — when my good friend Irma was taken away — and many, many of our — of my friends and then the <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> was closed and we had classes for a very short time in the an old <span class="BUILDING">orphanage building</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And then of course, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was stopped completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And because my father was a Slovak citizen, and because he had — his business was taken over by a German Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He was a dentist, and he we think that he was an executioner because whenever the grapevine said that there had been some kind of shooting of German dissidents, he was away from the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And he walked around, with a gun, he had a gun in my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and whenever he called my father in for consultation, he would open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and they, the conversation would go on over a gun sitting in the middle of my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And so he wanted to keep my father because this man knew absolutely nothing about running the business, so he wanted to keep my father on. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My father had the choice of staying behind when we were supposed to be sent to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And he could have stayed behind and just had his family go but he didn't want to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He thought he could protect us if he would come with us, and ironically, very sadly, he is the one who did not survive the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My brother and my mother and I managed to scratch out of it and survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, because of that, we were among the last few full Jews — I mean there were a lot of mixed marriages, and there were a lot of off-spring you know who were half Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Those were — some of them were let sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> after we left — but we were among the full Jews the last few to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Now the reason we were not put into — and we were told we were not put into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with the gas going — was that we were such a small transport and it didn't pay for them to use up a whole lot of gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So, they figured they'd send us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we would be somehow dead within a short time anyway, so they just shipped us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were joined by a lot of Polish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But they were forced laborers, women, who were taken into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They were probably — maybe they said they didn't like the food or they objected to something, and they were then taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So as we were going along, and we were only riding during the day because at night the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Allied planes</span> flew overhead and they didn't, and of course the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> had no way of knowing who was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">If they thought that we carried ammunition they would bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So they made us stay at night in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and whatever along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we did the few hundred miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in, I think, something like seven days and no nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But wherever we went, we picked up several prisoners and they — non-Jewish prisoners — and they went to camp with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But we were the last Jews, were about 37 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And as far as I know, only my mother and my brother and I, and one other young boy survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I think that was a pretty high percentage because if we had been gassed of course no one would have been alive from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And at the — when you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — with all the pictures that you see of the SS men with the dogs and a beautiful bright day in April.... We were taken away on the 19th of April which was Hitler's birthday — or the 20", or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was the 20th wasn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">This was supposed to be a birthday present to the Fiihrer, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be Judenrein,’ and that was why they shipped, gathered us on the 19th of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And it took us about a week to get there, and it was a beautiful, bright, lovely day. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It seems almost impossible that something this horrible could go on in the world on a beautiful day like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We saw my father, from far away, and that was the last I ever saw of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Our clothes were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Our hair was shaved off. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My brother stayed with us for a very short time — was allowed to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then they decided that it wasn't moral for a young boy to live with all these women who would sometimes would be in the nude. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But of course it was very moral for them to have us to get undressed and to parade in front of an SS officer or a few SS officers anytime they wished and anytime a whimsy struck them you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But this was immoral and my brother was taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> , and he managed to live through it somehow and of course he survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  You told me a story about your mother at the Selektion.” </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Would you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  When she saved — when she pulled me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I— when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , a few months later, I think, almost everybody became very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My mother had malaria too, but she never had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I was the one who came down with typhus, and I have very little memory of what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But my mother dressed me every morning, took me out to this Zahlappell° — which is the equivalent of roll call — and dragged me to work so that I wouldn't be beaten or sent into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> — the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> which was, which was really a <span class="BUILDING">death barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So my mother dragged me around, but of course I looked terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And there was the Selektion for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> one time, and we were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and this SS man told me to go in one direction and my mother into another because I looked so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And of course I was just wasting the food — this 200 calories worth of food that they gave us everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So my mother pleaded with him and said that, well, I'm her child and she, can't she come with, can't I come with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And he said, “No, but if you're so concerned about your daughter, go with her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And she was just about to do this, and, and one of the women, who was working in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> — I think she swept <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and whatever and maybe cleaned the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> and whatever other menial work, but she had some kind of protected position, whatever that was worth — she sort of grabbed me under one arm and my mother grabbed my other arm, and we managed to walk away. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We were not even stopped, and it was some kind of miracle that the SS man didn't notice that or, or pretended not to notice us. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And just, and we just kept going and my life was saved that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was really the most amazing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I can't figure out. * </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Leader (German) * Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe <span class="REGION">areas</span> that had been completely purged of their Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">> Selection (German); term used for process of selecting prisoners for immediate liquidation or continued forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">° roll call count (German) Of course, I was sick and I don't know exactly what went on — the excitement of the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But my life was saved that day
QUESTION:  Tell me more about what you remember about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Well, of course the first day we arrived my hair was shaved and we were standing completely in the nude and I was frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was thirteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I called my mother, and she answered me and I turned around to look for her, but I didn't recognize her because, of course, she had no hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Was impossible to recognize her totally without clothes and without hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And then, we were tattooed and of course was nothing like the, the disinfectant or anything put on the ta— on the needles. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Everybody's tattoo became slightly infected but it — that stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And we were brought into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , at first into the “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">A” camp</span> and then later on into the “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B” camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">One of our first chores was — they had — the <span class="DLF">roads</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They were muddy and then the mud dried. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was full of ruts, so they had this big steamroller. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But 1t wasn't propelled by steam, it was pushed by prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was tremendous and they filled it up with sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You had to fill it with sand, so it would be heavy, and then someone had to go out and push it to even the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So, one of our first jobs was to fill this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamroller</span> and then later on — or whatever it was, 1t was a tremendous roller — and then later on to push it across the ruts to try and even out the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I don't think it was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And one of our next jobs was to even out the <span class="DLF">road</span> , to dig out wherever the <span class="DLF">road</span> was higher and to fill in where the <span class="DLF">road</span> was lower. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It really didn't make any sense because we dug parts of the <span class="DLF">road</span> out, filled in another <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And it seemed like this kind of work was designed to take our energy away and to make us weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I think that was the purpose, to demoralize us and to sap our strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Then we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we had this horrible food. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Where we had — they once — I don't know, a few times a week, maybe two or three times a week — we had a slice of salami which was about an inch thick and sometimes it was liverwurst. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And something that came out of rusty barrels — it was called “tea” — and sometimes they had soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They made soup out of bean — no some kind of turnips, that weren't even peeled and potato peels and the sand wasn't washed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And they just threw everything together, and even at times they emptied out bags that the people had brought food when they were taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and were — and it was — sometimes these bags of food managed to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But it wasn't assorted, they just emptied everything into this pot of soup that they were cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We found combs and compacts and things like that sometimes in the soup, because they never bothered to assort it. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And that was the food that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And it must have been just a few hundred calories a day because everybody was getting sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">One of the signs of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency is sores, and people had terrible sores which festered on their legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And that was one of the things that you could be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> for. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">As soon as someone had a sore like that, or the scratches from scabies that was a reason to be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Now I was very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I also had scabies at one time but somehow it didn't get into my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It stayed on my body, and there was a Selektion and they didn't, that day, make us take off our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So they didn't that I had scabies and that also saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Now scabies can be cured with a few pennies worth of sulfur cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But of course no one had it and they were not interested in saving anyone of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They were interested in having people get sick and having people die or be in such condition that they would take them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was just a few minutes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We could see the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> from wherever we were, and of course we could smell the gas when it was left, let out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And then we could smell the burning of the bodies, the human flesh burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Then they cleared the grates and we could hear the grates being cleaned and it's similar to what your own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> would be like when you move the grates around except in a much — it was much noisier that we could hear all the way in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And to this day when I clean my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , I am reminded of that noise of the cleaning of the grates in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Well, we lived through the — these times. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I made friends with a girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Her name was Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="198">She was about 18 at the time and her sister was a year or two younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I had not even realized that the Nazis were trying to eliminate even the Jews of as far south as <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I saw — I met people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in 1981 who were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> and they had done the same thing to the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , and I really wasn't aware that they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Well, anyway, the Greek girls were taken from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Most of them were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They were taken from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and of course their parents either had been killed or they were left behind and were taken out another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So I made friends with Nini Ben Mayoa. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">She was studying to be an opera singer, and to us at the time, when she sang, it was like the most beautiful thing you could ever hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Maybe she had a beautiful voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">To me it now sounds like she really, you know, she was like an angel singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And of course there were Jews from all over Europe and every language was spoken in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> except English. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And they didn't get as far to, to the English Jews yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So all the — they under-— they realized that everybody in order to communicate — and luckily they didn't stop that — would speak in the language that she would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Nini and I could communicate in English because I had studied English and so did she, and that was the only way — the only language that the two of us had in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Of course this was forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So because it was forbidden — I mean, you were 13 years old, you — in spite of 1t everything — you tried, you think you're very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And so we were speaking 1n English and, and she told then the story that she was taken and that she trying to be an opera singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And she — whenever there was a chance, Nini would sing for the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And of course we had so few mental escapes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We had so few anything that was nice that was happening, that you were really, we begged her all the time whenever she was being halfway in the mood to sing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Well, her sister died in the summer and after that all the spirit went out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She just lost all hope and of course she didn't sing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But shortly before that somehow this SS man, Taube’ — did you ever hear his name, Drechsler® and Taube? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">The woman's name was Drechsler and his name was Taube. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They were not officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They were — but they were the ones who kept order by beating in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Well, he had heard that Nini had a wonderful voice, and he proposed that she live in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , yes, and sing for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And Nini knew what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But you have to realize for the time that she would have been alive and of course you were hoping everyday that maybe through some miracle there would be some kind of release. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But for the time that she might have stalled and would have been alive, she might have lived in clean sheets and would have had a bath and would have had some fairly decent food. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And so the sacrifice that she made was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She refused him. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And among the next Selektions to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , her number was prominently mentioned and there was no way that anyone could have erased the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I mean he made sure that she was on that next transport to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And of course she was killed that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But I have been telling my sons about this and all their lives they've heard about Nini and how the heroic stand that this girl took and her bravery of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in 1980, ‘81, for the gathering, I was looking for people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> because I really had a very great rapport with most of them, I mean with all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They were really very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They were — you know, young girls who spoke several languages — they were very happy as far as it could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They were, were very talented. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They danced and they sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There was still a woman; her name was Stella, who did a lot of dancing and she entertained us. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I was told that she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after the war, that she and her daughter had some kind of nightclub act. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But I understand something sophisticated and everybody asked, “Well, if you're so interested, how come you didn't find out about her?” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I really never found out what became of Stella, but she did entertain us with some very beautiful dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But, so I went around looking for people who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and I didn't meet anyone that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But on the last night when President — Prime Minister Begin was speaking at the <span class="DLF">Wall</span> — I heard someone, a man in back of me say that he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And of course my ears stood up and I turned around and asked him some — if he knew any of my friends and I, in passing, mentioned that my friend had been Nini Ben Mayoa(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="246">No, it's not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But anyway, he said there was still a Mr. Ben Mayoa(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He's the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and I should get in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Well, of course, as soon as I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I tried to figure out a way of getting in touch with him and the only thing I knew how to go about getting a foreign address was get in touch with the Federation. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And within a half hour I had the address of the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> who then forwarded the letter to Mr. Ben Mayoa and Mr. Ben Mayoa 1s a cousin of Nini's. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">When they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> we had a very nice visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We met at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> because this is half-way between where he was staying and my — where my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was and a lot of reminiscences and of course we sort of corresponded for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was very interesting to be able to reminisce ’ Adolf Taube ® Margot Drechsler about all the thing with Nini. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">One of the things that Nini sang and I guess it must have been part of her training was Avé Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And of course I was — we always begged her to sing Avé Maria and to this day I am sometimes invited to Catholic weddings and I listen to Avé Maria and of course I start crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And everybody goes on look at this Jewish woman — how touched by Avé Maria, but they do not know the memories I have of Avé Maria and Nini. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that was one of real unforgettable friendships that I did form in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And my mother and I were together for the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">At first we worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they — it was called “Weberei,”” “the weaving place.” </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Radar was coming into prominence at that time, the British airforce used it against the Nazi airforce. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The Nazis tried to stop — they tried to interfere and cause static so they made us weave. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were told that what it was — I am not a hundred percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They made us weave plastic — braid plastic strips and they were going to drop this, hoping that that would interfere with the radar transmission. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were dropping this from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and we were forced to keep plaiting these things in the Weberei. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">This was one of the jobs in the <span class="BUILDING">Weberei</span> and we worked there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And somehow, through knowing someone, my mother and I were assigned to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanada</span> ,” where all the belongings that came into the camp that the prisoners took with them and — of course, everything was taken away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">All this was brought in and assorted and than packed and sent into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And even the word Kanada — spelled with “K” the German way, “KANADA” — it was a metaphor for all that is plentiful and available and just there because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I guess to them, meant a lot of riches. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And so that's what it was nicknamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My mother and I worked there, and we assorted mainly blankets and comforters that people had taken with them, hoping that they would be able to use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Of course most of them didn't even live to see what was happening with it, but even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they all had these raggedy old rags and for blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were full of lice and every so often they were cleaned and the straw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But when the things that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanada</span> were assorted and just sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and one time was a tremendously high pile of comforters, and we had a few minutes during lunch break, and I had found a book Nathan the wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Actually the play of Nathan the Wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">During lunchtime, I crawled up on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> hoping that no one would see me, and I was reading it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But of course when you come in came in from an angle at the, at the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you could see me up on top there. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And an SS woman came in and called me down and took the book and threw it away and really boxed my ears until I was dizzy for reading that. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So even this small attempt at culture of course was stopped of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I don't know if you realize that Nathan the Wise was written by a German"? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">in praise of a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But of course I don't know this, and probably she wasn't even aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It's just that she didn't want anything like this to be available as activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">7 <span class="BUILDING">Weaving mill</span> (German) '” <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> (German); term for the warehouse of looted goods at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; also used to refer to prisoners who where assigned to work in the warehouse facilities. ‘' </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Gotthold Ephraim Lessing While I'm — the belt? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Right, the belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">While I — while we were in — working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanada</span> we were not allowed to wear what was really — would be considered civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">While, the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , were not given these stripped clothes, not all of them, they were wearing stripped clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They were given the old rag clothes that were taken off the bodies, and given to them and they lasted until they really fell off and they were full of mud and filth and lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then every so often they, they would — the lice — the clothes were taken away and they were put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> to kill the lice, and then of course all the nits were dead but they were all sitting in the seams and were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And those were the clothes that the prisoners wore but because we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanada</span> , and we were not supposed to wear <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anything that was still wearable that they could ship to the Reich they — we were supposed to wear these long prison uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I was very — I was getting thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I had been sick and the dresses were very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The mud in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was just — it was clay and it stuck to the dresses, to the hem of the dresses, and when it dried it was very heavy and very difficult to remove. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And it dragged us down. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Of course, we didn't have much strength to drag ourselves around let alone a muddy dress, so most prisoners found some pieces of string, tied it together and pulled up their dresses and we were allowed to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I found a belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The Greek girls who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had brought in a lot of knitted dresses with beautiful rose designs knitted into the hem and into the top and when I saw the belt it had, it was blue felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It had yellow and red felt flowers sewn on. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I thought that it was a Greek handiwork, and of course being Greek you know, having been so fond of the Greek girls, I was felt very sentimental about the belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But later on when I showed it to someone, it turned out that the belt was not Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But whatever it was, I had the belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I used it to pull my dress up. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Of course we weren't allowed to wear anything that would be an adornment, so because I bloused the belt over the — bloused my dress over the belt, I was able to wear the belt and no one saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And my mother kept saying, “Oh Ruth, you know, look at how thin you're getting, my poor child. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Look, this starvation is terrible for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so I kept telling her, “But no, the belt isn't getting, isn't — I'm not getting thinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The belt is getting longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The belt is stretching.” </span><span class="sentence" id="309">That's how I tried to appease her. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And there was a button at one time on that belt and the button came off and then I ended up just using a safety pin that I found, a rusty old safety pin. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And the belt went with me even later on when we worked in — were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> , and I did have another different kind of skirt and I was able to use the belt just as an adornment, but no one paid any attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">This was towards the end of the war, and no one paid any attention to that anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And so I had the belt with me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And of course once I was in freedom, I wouldn't part with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I was very happy that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> could make use of it now because I felt that if anyone would go through my belongings and see this raggedy, dirty old faded belt they would say, “What is this woman saving this for?” </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And this way there is a whole story attached to it and I'm very happy that I can relate this story of the belt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  You were telling me earlier about your mother helping a woman who was in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Can you tell us that story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  Yes, my, my mother — when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">For a short time there was a — two sisters were brought in and I think they were from the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> and their names were Tesha and Nusha Unger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That was their maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">One of the ladies, as I understand the story — but I'm not sure about, of course, a hundred percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Nothing is a hundred percent sure of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">One of the ladies supposedly had given poison to her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">There was not enough for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I'm not sure now, if this is the story that I really — it was told to me in this kind of secret, or if this was really true. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She wanted to commit suicide at the first chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">She was very despondent and one time my mother saw her running out into, into — towards the moat that was out by the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And of course there were the soldiers on top shooting, and as soon as you crossed this little <span class="DLF">ditch</span> you would be shot but they — when they saw some one running towards the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they started shooting immediately too. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So my mother ran after her and I mean among all the bullets and amidst all the bullets she was able to pull the woman back. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">She came to visit us after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">She and her sister came to visit us after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Somehow I've lost touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I'm not sure if the story was that I was told was in the sequence and I hope it doesn't bring out a whole lot of pain to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We never mentioned it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But this is what I think my moth— this is what my mother told me had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And my mother had saved her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And of course there were many things that we witnessed that I'm not sure if anyone else has talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">At one time there was a young man working in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> supervised by a group of Nazi officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And inadvertently — they were shoveling the mud there — he started whistling the Internationale,'~ which is the Communist — yes, the Communist song and the anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And as of course, the Nazis were very much opposed to Communism — that's how they came to power — this was of course the ultimate in anything they would hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And immediately on the spot he shot this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My mother was telling me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">She was really upset her and ageravated over this when she told me, was very agitated, that she had seen this happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So those were the things that I remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Of course there are many, many more tales and one time I was working somewhere and my brother was still with us at the time, and my mother and my brother were being taken to a Selektion, and my brother was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Of course he was four years younger than me, about nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He was taken — the Nazi officer told them to go to, to the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That meant where they were being — that this group is being sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , to the — I'm sorry — to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And my mother and my brother suddenly were taken by a German soldier, pulled away and hidden behind a pile of coal in a different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And when my mother asked him why he had done this, he said while he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there he had witnessed a shooting of — actually mass shooting of people from a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were taken to a, they were taken to a <span class="DLF">pit</span> and everyone was shot and then thrown into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And sometimes they weren't even shot, they were still alive when they were shot into * Tnternational (German): Communist anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">the <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And one of the Nazi officers had said to this woman who was walking up towards the <span class="DLF">pit</span> with two children, one 1n each hand, that she can live if she picks one of the children to be sent into the — to be shot and fall into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And then she and the other child could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And the woman of course saw no hope so she firmly grabbed both children and jumped into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And this German soldier was so touched by what she had done that he swore to himself at the time that if he ever could save a mother and a child, he would make it his mission to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And he did that by saving my mother and my brother and hiding them for the day behind a pile of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I never knew who the man was, and my mother didn't know him either. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It was just a very strange and human gesture in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , or in a surrounding, of inhumanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And it was a very touching thing that something like that could happen, even the—there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And of course it was very, very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">When we first came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , my mother needed — had some medication at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And there was a German doctor, Doctor Wolpe(ph) and an SS man standing there, and I went up to him and very naively telling him that my mother needed this medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And he just laughed at me and walked away and it was — he was — there was this irony in his laughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Of course why was I bothering him with nonsense medication for my mother when she wouldn't be alive probably within a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So there was very little that was human — humane in the in anything that happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Of course I still picture the Dr. Mengele’” — the so- called Dr. Mengele — who stood at the Selektion and humming Mozart. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Sometimes when I — and I am very fond of Mozart — but sometimes when I happen to sing Mozart I catch myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I think. “</span><span class="sentence" id="373">Look, you're doing the same thing that Mengele did.” </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But no, he was doing the same thing I am doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He was using some kind of humanity that he had learned and he was.... When I introduced this once to some people where I speak on the Holocaust, and she was shocked that he was able to sing Mozart. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And she said she wondering how much of Mengele is in every one, in every person. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I don't believe that that 1s necessarily so. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I don't want to philosophize. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I don't know if — how these people were bred or conditioned to do this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But how can one — especially some one who might have known the history of — that the biography of Mozart was such an equal and you know and such a person who would really wanted to see it equality for all people — abuse the music. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Or maybe he wasn't even thinking or there was this veneer of culture that happened and — to them and yet was not used properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It's — sometimes I think back and I wonder, “Did this really happen to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Could really some one have done what really happened to other human beings?” </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They tell the story that Himmler'* once came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , long before I got there, and when he saw what went on, he went from somewhere and he vomited. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But from — maybe from the odor, or from whatever went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But that did not stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And of course the killing went on and he was of course was the most notorious of all the killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I'm going through — with now more than 40 years — I'm going through this in my mind over and over and I'm trying to figure out why — how inhumanity....

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Is there anything you want to add about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Any other story you want to add or tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, I've told you many stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">What is it in particular that you had in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  You talked about eating a piece of salami?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The salami they gave us something like this — probably about an inch or a little bit less than an inch slice, slab of salami or liverwurst once, or twice, or three times a week in addition to the little pieces of bread that we got daily and the tea that came out, out of the rusty barrels and this “wonderful” turnip soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And we, one time — the salami had a terrible odor. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They said it was made of horsemeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It had some kind of a flavor of urine. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And one time in the evening I was just given a piece of this salami and I looked out at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> going at full force and, or course, was at night, you could see the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">During the daytime you could only see the smoke coming out but at night you could see the flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Well, you know, some flames, but the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was fairly red. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I was thinking of the people that were destroyed there and I was thinking, “Oh my God, I hope the salami doesn't contain human flesh.” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I threw up from it and after that — this was towards the end that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — and after that I was never able to even catch a piece of the salami and whenever it was given to me, I traded it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Now some people would — who didn't have the same experiences, I did of course — didn't know and were anxious to trade it for this little piece of bread that I could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But I could never eat a piece of salami like that again and that was one of the more — well I think there were a lot of things that went on and if I go through it in my mind, more and more will come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Of course because I did have typhus, I did forget a lot of the incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And maybe in my own mind I try to push them aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I was never able to watch many of the programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Even when the Eichmann” trial — other people were able to watch on television and I just couldn't face up to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I it's only recently I have written on the Holocaust and have spoken about it at <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> on it, that I am able to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I still cannot get any kind, watch any kind of movie on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I sometimes think, “Oh I'm brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I'm going to do this now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And two minutes into the program, and it goes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I don't even go to any war pictures of any kind of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I think maybe one of the reasons I am so anxious to talk about it is that I think that this kind of cruelty can be prevented and can be stopped before it gets out of hand ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Maybe that's my small contribution I can make to this.

QUESTION:  Can you tell us about the shoes you wore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Oh gosh, the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Everyone was given shoes in regulation, these clogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They were just, you know, wooden soles and little canvas strips to hold, to put the feet in. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The earth in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was very muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It had been I understand no <span class="REGION">man's land</span> between the wars and there were fish hatcheries and it was very wet and humid. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And we were given those shoes and then when it rained the shoes were stuck in the mud and we had to force our feet to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Of course we had no strength to pull ourselves out, and those shoes were in there and you know when you are walking in it, if the shoes were stuck and you tried to pick them up and you weren't fast enough, you got a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The SS made us walk to the back with this and when the weather was dry the — it wasn't the — 1t was very difficult to walk in those ruts too, because the earth had dried so uneven. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So these shoes were really the least desirable of what you can get and when we were able to find an old pair of shoes we tried to exchange and to adapt it as best we could to our own use. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So I think it must have been in <span class="COUNTRY">Kanada</span> that I found a pair of shoes and it was something that was fashionable at the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It had long points and they were boots that you buckled up and they were very elegant. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The elegant ladies wore it at the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And but they were much too small for me and this was one of the things that would not be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because no one would be able to wear those shoes and they had been out of style. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But they were also very, very uncomfortable and they were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They were much too small for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And so I wore them with my foot in the leather side, the heel of my foot coming out on the <span class="REGION">leather side</span> , rather than fitting over the heel, so that the heel stuck out on the side and I was walking on the, the leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This was of course preferable to the clogs, those, those wooden clogs but not much preferable. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It killed my feet and one of the first things that I did after the war — I mean when we were walking, we were walking from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> for eight days, and finally somewhere in <span class="BUILDING">German farmhouse</span> I found a pair of shoes — and this was the first thing that I threw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Of course I'm sorry now that I didn't save the shoes, but I hated them so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I mean they really did terrible things to my feet, but they would have been a very poignant memento for the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But unfortunately I don't have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But they were terrible boots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Under what circumstances did you finally leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Well, we were told, and it turned out to be true, that the German war machines were suffering because there wasn't enough labor and they needed some laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And one time we were told that within a day or so we would be leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and to prepare whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The things we had were nothing — maybe a kerchief where we could carry our bread in. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And on November 1, 1944, we were loaded on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that brought people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was so-called freedom, the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we were sitting on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for a while and we didn't know which way it was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We were hoping that it was true that we were really being taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to for labor, but it could have been just the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We could have gone up to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> after we'd been going. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Well, finally the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved out and we were indeed taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> because all this is in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , very close to the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">We were taken there and we were kept in a very large <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , something like a <span class="BUILDING">circus tent</span> , for several days without food and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was the, without the water, I mean we were sort of used to starvation, but without water which is something awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It rained and we had these spoons, and we were trying to put our spoon <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> to try and collect a few drops of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But of course we didn't have the patience to wait for the spoon to fill up, so as soon as we had a few drops of water, we would anxiously drink it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But a few days later we were taken to an actually <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> and then — I'm sorry, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> — and then taken again, shipped by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , somewhere near the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , somewhere near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span> — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Where the German soldiers finally surrendered and where the four armies of the Allies eventually met. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But— [TECHNICAL CONVERSATION] TAPE #2 [TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]
QUESTION:  Let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You were telling me the story what happened at Christmastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Would you tell the story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  Yes, this is Christmas Day, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> celebrates two days of Christmas This is the last day of Christmas and so it had to be December 25th in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It's very much in my memory, one of the few things that I really remember very, very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In the summer before, a woman had, a Jewish woman had been brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">She had been a young married woman, and what wasn't obvious at the time was that she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And when she — as she went along of course, she was losing weight because she was getting emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And these prison clothes, these ill-fitting clothes whatever it was, was hiding her condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And when we went out to roll call, we were five deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So the prisoners sort of always put her in between where it couldn't be noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I mean, it was like an unwritten order that we had among ourselves that we just obeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">At the same time there were also non- Jewish laborers, and some of them were in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">There was one particular woman I remember, Pani Wandzia(ph), a very tall aristocratic woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And we — I was told that she came from some very aristocratic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">She was allowed — the Polish prisoners somehow I think were allowed to have two times a year packages mailed from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">She had one at Christmas time. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And then there were these three Polish slave labor women who worked outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but stayed 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I don't think they got any Christmas — there was no one to send them any packages too. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And so they worked outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> somewhere and they were treated almost as badly as Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">The only exception was — got the same food, got the same everything, except non-Jewish prisoners were never taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selektion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">If they died, they died, but nothing was done really to help them, nothing was done by the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But that was the only difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Of course it made a large difference but they were treated the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And so they worked somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Now came Christmas time. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Somehow they managed to pluck from somewhere this tiny little branch of a pine <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , probably about this tall, and they made a base out of chewed bread and stuck this Christmas tree in. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And it so happened that this woman who was pregnant, went into labor that night, and had a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Now the next morning there was no roll call and that that was the only free time that I remember while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , when there was no Zahlappell in the morning or in the evening, one, one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I think it was only because the SS were out late reveling at night and they didn't expect to get up very early, so they figured well they weren't going to do it that one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And the next morning my mother and I walked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in some strange quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">There was an awe about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It seemed almost like pink cotton was enveloping the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — strange light. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And between a little Jewish boy being born the night before, and being Christmas time and this strange light in the — around us, these Polish women kept saying that a miracle has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And this must be the miracle when we would be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And this would be the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And when you're so desperate — even though I am Jewish and didn't think that could happen to me, I wasn't brought up to believe in it — we somehow decided to believe, “Well, maybe you hang on to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Maybe there is some truth to the story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And this went on almost all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Now — and everyone was beginning to be a little bit, to talk, to begin to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I mean we really didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We were too realistic and too many things had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Somehow we felt that maybe something could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Well, by five o'clock of course the spell was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Was around five o'clock, towards evening, when this spell was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We heard the familiar sound of four, three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">People were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> — open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , with prisoners being taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And it was preceded by an German, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">command car</span> that the couple of German officers rode in, and in back of it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with the Red Cross on it that, whoever would observe it would think there's some kind of Red Cross, some kind of charitable or humane—humanitarian project going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But of course that was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that held the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And they, we of course recognized the noise of the approaching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">At that point when the they drove between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> which was separated by high wires, electrically-charged wires, and they had to go around the bend and get to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , to the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> which we saw, and we didn't see the actual compound from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but we saw the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Of course they were very tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So they approached the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and as they — the prisoners in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came within the sight of the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> — they started singing the Hatikvah.'</span><span class="sentence" id="520">° And then the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> started in and then the third and fourth — if there was four. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I am not a hundred percent sure how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And of course they were driven into the compound of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and as they were driven in, the first voice stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and then the second and then the third, and we had the, the familiar noises of the steam going and the smell and the noises of the gra—grates of the of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , and the next morning, this roll call again. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And of course no miracle had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But as we were standing roll call, there was — the body of the baby washed out into the into the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> that I don't know where it went because actually the Germans probably would have seen that there was a baby, would have seen the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I don't know where it ended, but maybe they didn't even pay attention or maybe it went somewhere underground, and that was the end of the miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And it took another two years or so before we were really liberated, and a year and a half before we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">As a matter of fact bodies of babies — speaking of that, when we were 1n working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanada</span> , there was a baby found, smothered in the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It seems that either in the rush the baby was taken away from the mother and pushed in with the blankets, or maybe the mother tried to save the baby by putting it in with the belongings that she had, hoping that someone would pick up the baby, somewhat like Moses or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But of course nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And the baby was found dead rolled in some of these blankets and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So lives of children were very cheap and very expendable. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was, it's a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I think over 1,000.000 or so of the 6,000,000 that died were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You don't know all the potential that was killed at the time with such.... And that '® Hope (Hebrew); Jewish national anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">was one of the things — another one of the things that went on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And you know, when you speak about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , everyone has the same story of lice and rats and filthy clothes and beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">My mother — there was a time when a woman, Mala, '’ the —you might have heard this famous — she was a page or like an errand run—runner, between the Germans — between the Nazis and different groups of Nazis, and sometimes to the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">She had some friends and they managed to get Nazi clothes and they escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And a few days later she was caught and brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and she was hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They had a moat like, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">A few days after afterwards, they had to drag her and one of the things that everyone was saying was so amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">According to the Geneva Conference, you are supposed to — that was the story I was told — according to the Geneva Agreement, you're supposed to cure prisoners — a prisoner before you execute him. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And this is — and we were amazed that, of course, what did they pay attention to about Geneva conventions? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They dragged this poor woman with broken legs to the to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallows</span> and hanged her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And around the same time they had, they wanted to check up and make sure that we had all the — that anyone was there, that no one escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So they had extra roll call, this extra Zahlappell every hour, every hour of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And of course when you were standing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zahlappell</span> — it had to be like this — and you weren't allowed to move at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">This SS woman Drechsler came to take the Zahlappell, and my mother stood perfectly still but she followed her with her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">She saw the eyes moving, so she pulled my mother out of the ranks and slapped her and my mother fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Luckily she didn't shoot her right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But my mother had an ear ailment, she damaged her ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Until my mother died four years ago, this never cleared up completely and it was from that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But Mala's story has been written up. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">It is written in — I just recently read it again in a book Anus Mundi, by a Polish man.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He wrote about this extensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And this was one of the other things that went on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Every day was the same and for everyone, but not — and yet everyone has an individual story of his individual tragedy, their individual story of hopeless and whatever happened to them, so yes, it was all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We were all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We didn't even have a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We had a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We had our hair shaved, which was lucky because lice were by the billions. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But we also had individual things that we can remember and talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Is there anything that you want to add about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Well, there's probably so much and I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">When this happened with — in the Christmas.... After Christmas, my mother dreamt — now I don't know how much of her conscious went into this dream — that my father told her that now is the time to say Kaddish.'” </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And we have kept that day well as a memorial to my father, because it's the only day that we can really — that's tangible. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It is as valid as any other day, so we are using that day as memorial to my father — my brother and I. Well, we were taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> — from '’ Mala Zimetbaum '® Wieslaw Kielar " Holy One (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to honor the dead, especially close family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="570"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> was — had been, originally, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> equipped to have about 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But by the time we came in there were several thousand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But 1t was amazing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There were actual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">There was a real <span class="DLF">water fountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , which was two to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> instead of six, with actual blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And there were <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboards</span> to put your clothes in, little somethings. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And of course we didn't have anything to put in, but we — they were there and they were signs of civilization, something that.... It's amazing that how much, we had lived among civilized things with the equipment of civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I was — nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and everything, and yet when we saw these crude <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> we were amazed that this was civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And that there was something other than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And so we lived with in the in the camp with this and we were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , to a labor to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , this became a — but it became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> really because the SS officers went. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Some of them came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with us and some were picked up in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We were taken in the morning and marched for about several miles to something that looked like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were sparse they planted artificial <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and there were nets with leaves overhead to camouflage the, the things that were going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Then there was a <span class="DLF">sand hill</span> with some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> coming out of It, and on the side was a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Once you walked into this <span class="DLF">door</span> it was like a very modern looking <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> or some very clean <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was actually an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , very well camouflaged from attack from over-fly — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">overhead planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And we were — actually the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was honey-combed underneath with all these different <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">One group I know was making hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Our group was making bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And for being such a very modern <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and very cleverly designed <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , there was really the equip— the way we made the bullets was very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There was a board with little holes in it that I think there were 24 or whatever the number, tiny little small holes, and there was a— we — there was a half a capsule of a bullet put in — that we put 1t in—into each one of the <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Then we filled a certain amount of gunpowder into it, and then the other half of this board closed over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Something like a waffle iron, on that idea, or a hamburger press. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And the other half of the capsule of the bullet was pushed down and that made a bullet that would be used I guess in a regular gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">At both ends of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> — these were long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> we were sitting at and must have been about 20 or 30 prisoners on each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> — and on each end was a SS woman making sure that we did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Well, it was very difficult but I tried to not line up the top with the bottom part of this board as much as I could without being detected because I really didn't want to be hit or killed or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But I tried to sort of squeeze it in a crooked way so that it would close but not quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I was hoping that these bullets would misfire and I was hoping that in this way it would be my part of the war effort against the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Well, we worked in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and after the first of the year <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was — I think in the beginning of January, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was emptied and they brought a lot of prisoners from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> , I guess, and different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Most of the prisoners who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Of course you know, the Gypsies had been in a camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they were killed by families, just the way the Jews were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Because, in this hierarchy of “superman’’ that the Germans established, the Gypsies were just about one rank higher than the Jews and, of course, they had to be eliminated because they were a “lower people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And so we saw the Gypsies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were first brought in the end of — the middle of 1944, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They might have been there before but I became aware of them at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And then they were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> and they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They were happy- go-lucky people. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And maybe because they knew that the end of the Nazi era was coming — we weren't aware of it as much but they had been walking from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> which 1s I don't know how many miles, hundreds of miles — and they had seen what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They had taken meat of the dead horses and they brought it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they barbecued it and they shared it with who ever came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was exceedingly nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I mean they — I really have very, very good memories of the Gypsy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">The only thing that they did is that they were looking for wood to barbecue the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They took apart the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go any more, so we had to squat just over a <span class="DLF">hole</span> rather than over this little bit of wooden frame that was made for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But the Gypsies were very nice when they were brought in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And you know, I do speak about I do speak on the Holocaust very often, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , and I do want to mention the Gypsies because until recently no one set up a memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">No one did anything for them and the poor Gypsies are — I mean so many died unnamed that something — someone should remember that there were these people at one time and they were a kind and gentle people. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Throughout the history of Europe they were really denounced and, and feared and everything and they were very, very nice and gentle and very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But the — and they were in a camp with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> then when more and more people came in and eventually they could not take us to the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> anymore, and we stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The <span class="DLF">roads</span> became clogged with eastern Europeans trying to get back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and Russian — I'm sorry — German soldiers trying to run away from the Russian armies going, west and refugees — German refugees who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and were afraid of what would then happen to them were trying to make it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And most of the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were clogged with this and you couldn't get — you couldn't go to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And of course everything was breaking down and we — nothing was happening any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So — but what happened when in the last few days before the war ended was they also didn't give us any food any more and there were food riots because we were actually starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> were full of — well, they were not full, but there was bread in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and the prisoners were — didn't get anything so we rioted to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And my one — think a day or two, we were liberated — we were made to walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> march out of the camp on May 1, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">A day or two before there were these food riots and some—sometimes the Nazis from outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> this German officer would see the riots so they would shoot at the prisoners, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And once in a while someone was hurt from the shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Sometimes they shot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But they couldn't stop us. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I mean we knew that things were already happening and we really lost more and more of our fear you know, to some degree anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And so we went — we were rioting and my mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I was out and she was told that someone had been shot and of course she immediately imagined that 1t was me, but it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We stormed the food <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and that afternoon — that must have been the day before we were leaving — the food that the Nazis were eating — these Nazi officers in their <span class="INT_SPACE">mess hall</span> — was left on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , untouched like some of the fairy tales. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You know, the stuff is sitting there and the people are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And we were starved, but we ignored it and we were looking for the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> where they would keep all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So, we came to the <span class="BUILDING">storage place</span> , and there was something that looked like noodles to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Now, you have to realize I haven't had — I didn't have anything decent to eat you know in these years and noodles, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I took the noodles hoping that we would be able to at some point cook them and eat them, but I didn't know how, what to do, how to carry these. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Well, we already had been given regulation underwear, gray flannel. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It was tied with a string and that was it, but among the things that I wasn't supposed to wear was somewhere that I had found a pair of pink silk underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So I had that underneath the gray flannel. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I took off the gray flannels, pulled out the string, tied 1t on the bottom and made a bag and put these noodles in. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We then were told to line up to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">At that point the Swedish Red Cross had sent packages for the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And the first few prisoners, each one got a package, and then it was two to a package and because they were running out of packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Then it was five to a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And then by the time it came to us it was five to a package, which was a lucky thing because these packages contained cocoa and sardines and butter and our stomachs were not used to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">My mother became deadly ill from just eating something oily. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I think sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You know, we fell over it and actually she ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> — in a <span class="BUILDING">British army hospital</span> , for a few days because she was so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The right thing to — would have been probably to have some cereal a few times a day cooked in water and gradually bring our stomachs back to normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But that of course didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So we were given these packages and gradually everyone along the way had diarrhea and we were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the SS went with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">A few disappeared as we were marched along. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">At one time we were taken over a make-shift <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The <span class="DLF">bridge</span> had been destroyed but we had to get over a small part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and they took, there was a <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span> on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> below — above the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was below and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was all the way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So they took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and tied the legs together and made a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and we could only go over like two or three people at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Was a beautiful sunset I remember and we were walking over this. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And then we got to another <span class="NPIP">part</span> and I'm carrying this bag of noodles, what I thought was noodles, with me right along. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then on the way wherever we went, we managed to find — it was I guess harvest time or whatever, we found potatoes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and we managed to make a bonfire and bake the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They were most of the time just charred on the top and the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They tasted horrible but we managed to at least eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I carried this bag with noodles with me, waiting for an opportunity to cook it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Gradually the SS did disappear and sometimes they put on clothes to make them look like they were part of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We knew who they were, and of course they did have a tattoo under their arm to identify them as SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But of course we didn't see that and they thought well maybe no one would know about it and they would get away, you know, by just mixing with the population and pretending that they had — were nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So at one time we were brought into what had been a <span class="BUILDING">sugar factory</span> , was completely empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I guess there was no more sugar available. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And an SS woman saw me pass by and she called me into a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she was cleaning her guns there. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And she said to me, “I guess you'll be free soon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I was afraid to say, “Oh, how wonderful! </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I'm glad my time 1s finally coming.” </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So, I was saying. “</span><span class="sentence" id="676">Oh well, maybe it won't be so fast yet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I was trying to tell her something, and I think it might have saved my life, knowing full well that, of course, liberation was just a few days away. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But I was afraid to antagonize her yet, and that was actually my last encounter with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They really sort of disappeared and when they finally — when we finally did see them again, they were checked for this tattoo under their arm pits, by — I think the British part of the army that we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Well, anyway coming back to my noodles and these horrible potatoes that we were broiling — baking on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Finally, my mother found a rusty can of some sort and we went up — we were right along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , and my mother went and got some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And she went to see that we finally would cook these potatoes, these noodles, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Well the thing grew and grew and grew, and what I had dragged from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> were dehydrated potatoes when all we had was potatoes and I had dragged this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was one of my real disappointments of — you know, of having this. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But it was part of the life that went on in that was part of, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> —a part of my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">When of course when my mother and I walked on, we were near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> and we — the first thing we know, we saw was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> with different insignias on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">It was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American army tank</span> saluting us and we went one way and they went the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And then it — within a few hours, occupation forces changed, because all the different forces were meeting at in that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> — so at one time the French and British and Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And we ended up in a British, in a <span class="REGION">British zone</span> in — at the time in a <span class="REGION">zone</span> — I don't know what it finally became. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And we were there in a like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> which was during the summer, which was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We were in one section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> where there were Italian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">It seems that when Mussolini was hanged he was — the soldiers in the Italian army had a choice of either joining the German army or becoming prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">These soldiers that were on the other side of the camp had been the prisoners of war, and they were now being repatriated to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The only thing was I mean the transportation was destroyed and communications were hardly working. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So the they were sitting in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> waiting for things to normalize so they were in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Then when it was — when summer was coming to an end, the British army had to see — you know, they couldn't keep us out in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And they made some kind of travel arrangements for us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , rail, whatever was available to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They asked us where we wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Now we had agreed with my father and everyone — you know, my brother and my mother — that whoever would live would try to make his way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and so we could be united as a family and then see where we would go from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , sometime in the Fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We came back, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was practically destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Almost everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Even my mother who had no great love for anything German that had happened, after what had happened to us, really was like shocked when she saw this, saw this horrible destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And we stayed overnight in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> near the near the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where all kinds of people met. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And everybody exchanged experiences and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">At one point in that evening an American soldier came 1n and he had looked at the lists that the UNRRA” and the HIAS”' had printed of survivors and — as much information as they could, the origin and birthplace of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So, he had seen that we were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and he was looking for a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">He had left before the war and been in the American Army and was now looking for relatives, hoping that someone could tell them what had happened to him — to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And in the conversation — we didn't know anything about his relatives — but in the conversation, he mentioned that while he was doing the same thing in — while he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> he had read about a young boy who was also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So he went to ask him about his relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And the young boy fit the description of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So we said, "How do I write to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">How do I — can I get in touch with him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So he, he gave us an Army post number, and we wrote to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And somehow, the letter did get to my brother and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baury(ph</span> ) at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He had been liberated near the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He had remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> until the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And in January of 1945, they emptied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were burning all the bodies and all the evidence that was around, as much as they could, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">By then they were scared stiff for their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They thought that everything that happened, that they had done to other people, would happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And they should have been scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">My brother was telling me that he looked out at the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and he knew that they were packing up people to go, to go on this big march. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And they were.... He was looking out, and an SS man approached him and said, "Hah! </span><span class="sentence" id="725">You can go there, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Or, “You're going to be sent there, too." </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And my brother said, "You know, I don't care anymore what happens to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So much has happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I don't care what you do to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He said, "Because you said that, go out and join the march." </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And he walked until he was, somewhere, liberated near <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And he was taken — he met up with the British contingent of — actually, the Israeli contingent of the British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">They had an army, and they were anxious to get my brother into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Because he was a minor, and he was only one of — you know, minors were — the British allowed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And they felt, well, in a few more years he'll be old enough to go into the Israeli Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And they knew there would be, there would be a war, and there would — he would be needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And this indeed what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But we wrote to him, and he was already embarking to — by the time the mail got to him, he was already going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And eventually — he had been hurt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He didn't tell us that he had a problem with his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And they did surgery on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And because he could not lift his arm for any — he had a very serious infection, he couldn't lift his arm past just his shoulder height — the Israeli army then discharged him. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And so he was able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> very young, and he came to the *° United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration *! </span><span class="sentence" id="745">United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society. </span><span class="sentence" id="746"><span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But we’re always up and back with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And that was — we stayed around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , hoping — even though we knew better — that my father somehow could have made his way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to his birthplace, thinking that maybe somehow he would have ended up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Maybe he was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Maybe he was somewhere in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">But, of course, all this hope disappeared soon and on the last day that our visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was still good, was when we finally embarked and, and gave up all hope that my father was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But I still didn't give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Even when I came here I kept thinking, “Oh well, maybe somewhere, somehow I will hear that he is someplace else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But of course, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  Tell us about your early years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">When I sometimes think that the war against the Jews didn't just start in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It started much earlier — ended up in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">One of my first memories was probably before the Hitler election in 1932 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">We — I lived, we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> — <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , and the, there was a, a propaganda banner for the Socialist — National Socialist, Nazis — strung between — across the <span class="DLF">streets</span> down between the two <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And there was a lot of agitation in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I mean a lot of agra— they were really trying to get to the Jewish people, and to, to convince the non-Jews that they should vote for the Nazis because Jews were their enemy — and also against Communists, against anything that they wanted to be against. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And so this banner was across — was strung across and I looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">My parents had gone out, left me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I had — I saw the banner and I looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And but you know when you're three years old you don't have depth perception, and I don't think — and to me it seemed like it was a <span class="DLF">barrier</span> and my parents would never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And from that time on I did — I think I've told you this — and from that time on I knew that, you know, everything was topsy-turvy. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We — this — I think I have very many bad memories of people being killed, of relatives being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">My Aunt Selma volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Her, her fiancé was — my Aunt Selma could have stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Her fiancé was taken to the — to be selected to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , ostensibly, “resettlement in the east” as 1t was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And she just volunteered to go with him, and we never heard of or saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And that was, that was life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  After the war, you are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">How did you get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  Oh, very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I mean there were organizations that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">The HIAS, the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had their own groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we were told that we — was some form of Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Of course there was a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeilsheim</span> which was out on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hochst</span> , which 1s on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And you — you know, you listened to everything through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> and we were told we should sign up — go to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> and get our papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And then, of course, we waited, because of my — because we thought of my father and we waited until the last day to get to, to embark. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But that is what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And of course in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we were met by ladies from the HIAS and the UNRRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And HIAS were actually in the — and we were put for a few nights into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> on off-Broadway. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I think it was on <span class="DLF">103rd Street</span> and off-Broadway, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And then my mother took a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Clifton</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and we stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  How — you were telling me earlier, the way people reacted to you in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Can you talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Iam not happy to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It seems that we were not treated as having had the experiences that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">We were not treated as equal human beings, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We were told to take work as laborers, as domestics and this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And even though now my husband had been an American soldier — and to him I was someone who had survived a camp and had been brave enough and human enough to survive and be treated as a human being — his mother didn't go along with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">To her everything that was European — and she was born in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> — everything that was European was lowly and despised — despic—despicable, and shouldn't be.... She wanted to stay away from this and she didn't want to have anything to do with it and so this was wasn't good enough for her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I did have a lot of problems with her, and I found, in general, that a lot of people had this sort of reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I was active in the Memorial Committee —the Holocaust Memorial which is usually sometimes in April — and the people — the men who had worked on this before I became active in it, told me that they had a lot of resistance to making a memorial service and to even speaking about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And they had difficulty getting a stage to do the memorial service and it has only become fashionable to — I don't know, in the last 20 or so years — to speak about it, and to not consider it a badge of shame which — of course, which it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But I think we as surviv— as prisoners of the Nazis were told that we were “Untermenschen, ~” sub—sub-humans. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">That we were not up to par. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And I think it was so drilled into us that we kept actually believing that it still was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And what we really should have had, was a lot of counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">But, of course, organizations were more — they found the immediate need for clothing us, and feeding us, and finding shelter that that was really secondary. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It would have been just as important as any of the other things, because a lot of people floundered, have terrible traumatic lives since then because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And this 1s one of the — I think — things that have been learned that now most people do get counseling after hostage situations or after prison situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And immediately they do get counseling and it's very, ** Sub-humans (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial theory. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">It's one of the things that can't be stressed enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So life was very, very difficult for people arriving from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , without a family, with their whole background destroyed, without any means of support. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And those who did not want to be a burden to — and consider whatever the HIAS is doing — I mean, I considered it as charity; and I wanted to get away from it as quick as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">But to the people who did that, they really had to struggle from the bottom up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  How did you meet your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Well I was moping around and my mother was working and I did a lot of reading and all I wanted to do was read and I was very anxious to improve my English. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I did a lot of reading, and my mother didn't like the idea of my being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by myself all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So she told some young woman that she knew that she should take me out with her when—whenever. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And there was a dance in the <span class="BUILDING">Y</span> , and she — we went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">She somehow disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I was left up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And my husband asked me to dance, but I didn't really — I wasn't really thinking of dating and I really didn't want to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">So, “Well, I'll just dance for the evening, and then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And he wanted to walk with me, and I didn't let him. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And then there was the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> — this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paterson</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And I was walking along one <span class="DLF">street</span> ; he was walking along another <span class="DLF">street</span> , trying to catch up with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And he met me at the <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And after that, he started dating me. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That’s what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  Well, I'm sure there are a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And it's like taking an exam — when you, you know, later on you walk out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">That's what always happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I did work my way through <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I did work my way through <span class="BUILDING">grad school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I have a degree in a Bachelor's Degree in History, and a Master's Degree in Literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I know when I walked out of and into the <span class="DLF">parking lot</span> , I remembered all the correct answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So — and I'm sure that I'll say — as soon as I walk away from here, I'll think, "Oh, I should have mentioned this. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And I should have mentioned that." </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So maybe I'll have a chance to talk to you again, and you can put it on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And if there's anything you want to ask me, of course, I'll be glad to tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  Thank you for coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  Glad I can do something that will keep this in front of the public, so that eventually people will know that it really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Perhaps it can be a warning to the people, to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We're trying in our little way, I think all of us, all the survivors, are trying in a little way to say, “This is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Beware, don't fall into this sort of inhumanity."
