<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My maiden was Lederman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , September 4, 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother's name was Else Citroen Citon, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had come from -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon Sileppe. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Her name was Sileppe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And so that is how the Dutch family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because that's where they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They were three children, the old— four children actually, the oldest died very -- at 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child, and she had a brain tumor and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he has never seen his mother in anything but black ever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So I saw her in other clothes, but he never saw her in anything but black as he grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">At least that's how he sees it. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">People sees things in different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively happy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Didn't pay attention to anything but painting and art. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a brother, Hans who also survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Each of them had their own story, but they all survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and I had a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And we -- my father was a lawyer, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hisberg</span> , Silesian, over Silesian, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verslomberland</span> , later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> for his Ph.D. in law. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And he had a good practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And he was quite old really. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He was 35 when he married my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My mother was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That was done that way, that way, in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as being wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was -- my father loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and we went all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as soon as I could walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And he showed me absolutely everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Every little comer, and he liked history and music and we went to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and I still remember where the Rembrandt hung in this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in Ber-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because he loved it so. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Casovillan trains</span> , and the stories he told me about how Casovillan used to have big dinners in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Nobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was served and everybody had to leave very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">This was one of my father's story, stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We always went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And in 1933, when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on vacation, one of my many cousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> said to my mother he felt that she should not go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">This was 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And Uncle Biet had, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to cover a trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And nobody in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> paid in attention to this trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, "Why are you making such a fuss?" </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And he said, "You pay attention to this trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">This is going to end up being something quite awful and better everybody pay attention.” </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was Hitler's trial in 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Took 10 years til things really heated up. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So my mother, who always listened to my father because my father was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, "I think we shouldn't go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And my father said, "What does a lawyer do in a <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And she said, "Well, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">You'll find something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It's -- I really think we should not go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so father said, "Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I mean he had -- I think he graduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I mean it was -- it was practically impossible for him to start over. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he went into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and there were his secretaries and his assistants and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he could only have Jewish clients. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish clients. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But he had things like the Mid- European Watch Industry, a ___, Swiss Watch industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He had big companies that were his clients, and now he could not represent them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He packed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And we could still- I mean he could ship as much as he wanted to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we had two grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> , and he sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> big enough to hold grand pianos so there was a big change in our standard of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and French and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , of course, we had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My father had to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He worked for a Dutch ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He worked for a Dutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He handled the clients who were very much like him who had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and, you know, he couldn't practice along because he didn't have the Dutch degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So he went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and I think he was now -- how old was he in ‘34, °35? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He graduated in three years in a foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I was -- we were very proud of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He also worked at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">There was a big party and everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I got to my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in my class was a girl named Margo Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And they lived right behind us on the ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We lived at the _____——_—w which was the back of the same kind of development that they lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And we -- we always played at ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That's how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the same year and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of course, the kids played. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Without her, I would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was -- wanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So without her saying, "Today, we study," I wouldn't have been able to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So here we are in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He would've like me to become a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I was more the way my mother's family was. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">More playful and -- and liked imaginary games and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Let's see, where shall we go now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Did you meet Ann Frank too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, of course, we all played together, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And Ann came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a lot and we went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same kind of thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You -- you go around to the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and you work together for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and you do various things and My sister was a lot more serious than Ann was. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Anne liked games the way I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And she liked to play and have imagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My sister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Ann was a very difficult child, an extremely difficult child. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And not just for her family, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she went to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a Montessori kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And she did very well there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if you ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her was very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Margaret was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Had great big brown eyes -- a very serious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She would have made a real mark in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Just like my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My sister -- .I can't even imagine how wonderful she would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close to me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She wanted to see what I was doing and later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very -- a lot of good advice for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was just -- and she was so sensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was amazing! </span><span class="sentence" id="116">One of the letters I gave you 1s from her, and there you will see all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It's a very good letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Very, very young girl! </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Anyway, we had a normal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter and a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or Dutch because he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter and had a very happy life in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I have two very close relatives about my same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is the daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she 1s in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And now why was I telling you all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Family and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Family and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Can we go back a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I would like to go back just cause it has some relevance to your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There was a group of friends with you and Ann Frank and Margo. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">You had talked Hanna. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You had talked about Tummi. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And there's a picture all of you playing at the party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Well
QUESTION:  Tell us about that circle and tell us about that party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a lot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">By the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was entirely mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Wasn't all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Was a completely mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it came to it..you know when things got tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I personally have never -- have never experienced that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young people who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German? -- </span><span class="sentence" id="145">at that point I realize it was all German. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but it was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a German Jewish circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This was when we were trying to save ourselves, you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and was very good relationships between everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank, who by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had any kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And, of course, I was half Dutch anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , while the Germans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed -- we had a great curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We were not allowed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And my grandparents and my neighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and everything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not -- not as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food except very limited periods of time during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It was the first time that I realized that "Hey. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Hey. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I'm really German. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I'm not really Dutch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even aware of it, except when I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I was in the -- I was in the 3rd Grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I was put into the 3rd Grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I was eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I had to write what they calledin____———sw which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">That was -- you know, there I realized, you know, that it..that 1t was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And my clothes were all wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was very -- we were very elegant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I had fur coats and a hat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the kids were pretty much more still more ____, more plain, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So at some point there, I said to my mother, "This is 1t.

</span><span class="sentence" id="403">And then there was -- I mean a period there where people it wasn't one or two -- that's what I want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It was heaps of people killed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And then my parents told me it's because they're Jews and -- and Hitler, you know, doesn't like Jews and it was the first time I was really aware of -- We're weren't religious so we'd never had any kind of -- or very little connection with it, although my grandparents, I think, were. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> with my grandfather when he was still alive and in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He died in early -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while we still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I remember it being a happy experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He put me on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">It was the -- I -- what -- what is the day when when they finish reading the Torah and they start over. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Which one? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And he put me on his back and they danced around, you know, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I -- it was pretty wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And I remember him laying the Tefillin and I never knew what it meant and and we had Christmas at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I remember the Christmas tree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was great, with the real candles and the applies and the ___ and the nuts and the the gifts for..for the maids and for everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Everybody had gifts and presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Took my mother two months to get ready for Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I don't remember Hanukkah in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I don't remember it really until the Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Then that year -- and I think it was the Frank's also -- I think we -- we joined for the first time a reformed <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I remember the Rabbi’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">His name was Malhe, and that was spelled with a E, not an A. And I remember him so -- so clearly, and I even learned to read a little bit of Hebrew which I have entirely forgotten because it only lasted a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And my sister also went there, and I think Margaret and Ann and -- and quite a lot of..of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That was the occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I mean once the Hitler didn't shove us back into the old mold of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And 1t made a big difference in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  What was your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  You're doing just fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Just tell us what happened now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="432"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we had a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And much too outspoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I mean nobody knew what to do and how to behave in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">There was one group who knew a little bit and that was the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But I didn't -- didn't know anything about communists, but they were the ones who knew already a little bit because they had had some people who had escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in German, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">That was possible to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I mean at the very beginning in 1940, ‘41, people could escape from camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And these -- these communists had already been picked up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and they had come through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and they had told a little bit of what they had seen and what they had heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And so they informed their Dutch friends -- the Dutch communists, a little bit about things -- what things were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So the communists were a little bit prepared, but nobody else was prepared in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And
QUESTION:  What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You started to say --
ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big speech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Anyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody, of course, told on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They were fascists in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And then one started to hear about fascists right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out to be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Boy, they're lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I mean things like that, you know, which you'd never -- I'd never thought they were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I -- you know, I mean, they're know different from us, and weird things -- weird things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">As far as the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was concerned, I think we could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a little while, but then, again, there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and go to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and have be separated from the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I went to my parents and -- and I said, "I don't want to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I'm not going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I will not go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to go to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You know, I can just see the shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I -- it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I was really impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">My sister did. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And it was very frightening because what the Germans started to do 1s to isolate the Jews into various groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I mean they -- at a later date, not right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids 1n the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and that was the end of that you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Some people were then sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again if their parents had good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But I was -- every time I heard that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the Dutch Nazi, and anaspears. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They were called then anaspears marching toward the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, I would run to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to me, "The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere 1s not go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You know, I mean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know, about how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You had to be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">You have to learn to be scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I was not that scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You know, I was dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I was plain old dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But it was very frightening to have my sister in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> separated in the eastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We lived in the south and they had to go to_Oster, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ost . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Most of my friends did do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Most of my friends that were Jewish did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Some of them were picked up, and their parents and them shipped off. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Others, somehow, survived, you know, just like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You never know what's going to happen to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  What did you do during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  I went -- I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I wanted -- I told you I wanted to be a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And there was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ran by Alice Kayser in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , in___. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And she had a <span class="BUILDING">dancing school</span> as well, where you learned other things as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So it was -- it was recognized as a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And my Uncle Paul came and talked my parents into into letting me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He was always my savior in that respect because he had -- .my father was just adamant I was going to go to a <span class="BUILDING">academic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He didn't understand what was going on at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I don't know if it was a wish dream, if it was something he didn't want to understand, or whether it was just incomprehensible to him because he had been raised in a human -- humanitarian fashion and the Germans he knew were like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He knew many, many good Germans, and, of course, there were many, many good Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">What -- but they -- they didn't have any power. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So my father had trouble to understand and to -- he had great trouble to go along and make wise decisions in regard to the situation which -- which deteriorated from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">the first thing that happened was that the Germans took the German passport that my father had, so he had no nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He was stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We had applied for Dutch citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">You had to be there five years or I forget how many years before you could apply for Dutch citizenship and it's going to be granted in May of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And the Germans got there just a bit too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It -- this is very bad for me later on, because the Dutch -- dear Dutch after the war when, you know, my parents were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I was alone and they would not give me the Dutch citizenship, because they said your father applied, not you -- that your father applied. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Now at the time, I was under 16 and if you were under 16 the whole family was all naturalized at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But after the war, you know, I was nearly 20 and I was so called a grown-up and I had to apply for myself and they -- even though, you know, I went through all this S-H-I-T, and they would not give me that citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They sent me back the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">My father had paid 200 Gilden, and they sent it back I mean the bureaucracy was just so incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">There were many other things which I'll tell when we get to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Let's get back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So anyway, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was -- I went to Alice Kayser, and I went there for -- as long as my parents were there and could pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I went to Alice Kayser. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">In the end she was also taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And then that part of my life was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">My grandmother -- and I don't know the exact date now -- it was 19 -- it must be ‘42 my grandmother had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for elderly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">These were old people who brought their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and their own things. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They were -- and she had nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It was like -- what would you call it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">A <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the elderly I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">and she ran it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It was her. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I mean she set it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">She -- she had to make -- to earn money and and this is what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">She had help, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And one day they came and took everybody including her. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They had just emptied out the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The Germans they had came. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And my mother was beside herself -- beside herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">What to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We had to get her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Now the youngest brother, my mother's youngest brother was -- lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and if you want to, I can tell that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The older brother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , near The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gosmer</span> and had no funds, you know, whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So my mother went and took our jewelry to a jeweler. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">She got in touch with a guy named Putcomer, who was known to mediate between Germans and other people and -- to get people free. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he said to her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Well, my mother went and gave to____ Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry and said, "I need industrial diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Just see what you can do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And Nave came back and said there are no more industrial -- you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was closed up and -- there were other people besides us that were looking for that -- industrial diamonds and -- and he didn't have any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So Putcomer told the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The Germans came back and said we will take gold bullion -- gold bars, thick gold bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So my mother said to Nave, "It's gold bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Get us gold bars.” </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And then Nave managed to make or get or somehow gold bars, using my mother's jewelry as payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I remember that one day after my <span class="BUILDING">class</span> at -- was it after <span class="BUILDING">class</span> -- I think -- well, whenever I was told to go on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and pick up a package from Nave. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I had -- I had two bags, you know, these -- these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch bicycles</span> -- these black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> with a -- with the saddle bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">In one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was my books and the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was -- was -- the gold bouillon. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And Nave just handled them to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I think he wrapped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I brought them to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And my mother gave them to Mr. Putcomer and Mr. Putcomer gave them to the Germans and my grandmother got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And she then, of course, she couldn't live in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because that was -- they closed the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So she came and lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I mean, for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was extremely hard to have another mouth to feed. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It was very -- it started -- you had to start buying on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was starting to be very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I don't know if we already had ration coupons at this time or not but any case and my mother was so worried about my grandmother -- that she would be sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">She was in pretty good shape, but she was a tyrannical old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I can just see my poor mother between my father, who was so scared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids calm and trying to run the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and trying to get the food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we -- it must have been -- and she started to get very, very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I mean my mother got very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And I -- I was very busy with myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I was discovering boys and I was 16 and, you know, I..and but I even noticed she was getting very, very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I -- I loved her to distraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I mean she was my one solid -- my, you know, and -- and so was my father except I started to see he was scared and that was very scary. </span><span class="sentence"

I took courses as well as organizing the classes for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And in one of the courses and, of course, on ___very necessary for people who were going to get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And in a course on ___ I met -- there were two fellows actually that I liked, and one of them was Monfred. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And Monfred and I started going out vaguely if there was such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I mean he walked me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, you know, picked me up and we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">There was no transportation so we walked to __. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And he said to me about this remark of my father's -- Germans wouldn't do a thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">He said, "But your father doesn't know these Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">These are not the Germans your father knows -- knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">These are different Germans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He said to me, "Look at the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">That's the kind of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Look at the Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Don't look at the kind of Germans -- the lawyers and doctors and the kind of people that your father knew in the voluntary organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Look at who is running this <span class="NPIP">place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he tried to educate me, you know, to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It was hard because I believed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">You know, I mean he was my everything and I -- I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But I told my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And my mother said, "Mon might very well be right." </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And she said, "Bring him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I brought Monfred <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he and my mother and my sister became fast friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I mean they believed in Monfred, more than I believed in Monfred because I had something to protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And so -- but he -- he -- he was everything they said he was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He was the rock of the ages, and at 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He came from a different kind of family also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And he was political from a very, very early age, and so was his- his sister was less political, but very conscious of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And anyway Monfred told me that I would be murdered if I -- "If you get called up," he said to me, "you do not go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And I said, "That is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I mean what would happen to my parents if I don't go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And Monfred said to me, "Nothing that wouldn't happen otherwise," he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I mean I said, "What do you mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And he said, "Everyone who goes and gets into their hands will be killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He said, "They are all going to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And I wouldn't believe it and I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So he took me to a party -- one of those parties with the kids and everybody was sitting around saying we're going tomorrow and rah rah -- and Monfred said to me, "You see this guy over there, Leo Vials?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="707">Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="708">He says, "He's not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I said, "That's impossible.” </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He's saying he's going. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He said, "That's what you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Nobody has to know that he's not going, but he's part of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And he is not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And then it took him about three hours to explain to me how anybody could not go, and what you'd do if you don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And -- and how you survive, and where do you get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And where do you get money and -- And this was my first acquaintance with the possibility, you know, of not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a <span class="BUILDING">dance class</span> -- I met a fellow named ___ and he had a friend who he told me could get me false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Ike came to me and he said, "It is time for you to start thinking.” </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Now he was Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">He was not Jewish -- and he said to me, "It is time for you to start thinking about doing something about not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I said, "Where do you go come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Where do you take it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="723">He said, "I have a friend who told me all about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He said, "You need paper.” </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And he said, "It'll be 300 gilden.” </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">300 gilden. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">That was a lot of money you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said to my Mother that I needed the money and she said, "What for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And I said, "For the papers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And she said, "Tomorrow, when you go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you'll have it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And those were my first false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And they were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But they saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And on the papers -- in -- in those days, at the early days, the -- the false papers were people who died or people who had happened to have really lost them or various ways that you could get papers and what they would do 1s they would take out the picture of the person -- the original person, and insert your -- your picture and your fingerprint and whatever else they had to change -- to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And, of course, these were not papers that had a J on it, which those were identify papers without a J. They looked very authentic. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Now mine was of a 22 year old girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">| was 17 maybe and I looked like 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Pigtails, little. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So they were unlikely papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">If anybody really stood there and looked as it said, this girl is 22 years old you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So those were my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And I had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And then one night -- oh, he also, Monfred also -- then I told Monfred I had the papers and he looked at them and he said, "They're not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They're not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">They're very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Keep them where you can get to them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And then we went to another party, and there he had organized that one of the escaped communists from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was there and he took off his shirt and it was, you know, he had welts and -- and x-cuts and I mean it was pretty bad to look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And he -- and this guy told us that, you know, that he'd gotten that in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you know, and he had -- I think Bergen-Belsen. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">He had escaped and he was, he was telling us about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And he was telling us about the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> and he was telling us about all sorts of things, you know, that and when we were through with that, Monfred said to me, "Do you believe me now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I believed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I believed him! </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said to my father -- I told my father I had the papers, my false papers and I said to him, "I'm not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Whenever they call me, "I said, "I'm not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And my father said, "You have to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="757">He said, "What will happen to us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And there came this beautiful guilt was put on me like a hood you know, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">If you try to save yourself, that's what it meant, you know, we will all die. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Because in that -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> , they had various kinds of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for -- the normal <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for people were picked up normally, and they had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that had a big S on it for Straasburger, and in those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were the people who had been bad, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And that would -- would be them. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And those people would go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They would -- in during the selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and some survived just as much I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody else, which in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn't good. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and say, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I can't kill my family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And my father, he felt he had calmed me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And then one night we were sitting on our big <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and we were looking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It was -- already it was curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">There were curfews at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And all of a sudden, we see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Long rows of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And they're starting at the ____ at the -- at the high rise that you saw in the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">On the _____—s not on the ____ on ______ where we lived -- and they were coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I -- I mean I couldn't believe what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">They were pick -- going into every -- the way this -- and the <span class="DLF">street</span> is set up that they were -- every <span class="DLF">entrance</span> had <span class="DLF">steps</span> going up to a <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and then a wide <span class="DLF">staircase</span> going up to another <span class="DLF">platform</span> and on that <span class="DLF">platform</span> were six <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I think there were six. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And they would -- at that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They -- they came with lists and they picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked up old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But they picked up his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And she could hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">She was a very old lady, and I -- my stomach -- they were good friends of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">My stomach just turned. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They picked up all the people I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And they stopped about two <span class="DLF">stoops</span> before ours -- two -- you know, two <span class="DLF">platforms</span> before ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And, however, Monfred always knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And he knew -- he lived in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And he knew that they were doing our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And he sent this Leo Vial that I mentioned -- the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He had good false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">He was a German civilian -- German soldier of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He had -- wore a long leather coat and he was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor bike</span> and had hood on. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I mean you can imagine he looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And right in the middle of all this going on, the <span class="DLF">door</span> bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought they were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">You know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> aren't this far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They aren't at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">How come? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">What's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Monfred had sent him to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Right in the middle of all this thing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">This curfew and everything! </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So I put my false papers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I took it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I said to my father, "Goodbye.” </span><span class="sentence" id="809">He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and Leo drove off and told Monfred, "I can't get her. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">She -- they won't let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I can't make a fuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">If I make a fuss, I get arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So I can't, you know, make a fuss.” </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So he left and I was left there and, of course, that -- as I said, they stopped two <span class="DLF">platforms</span> before us so nothing happened to us that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But that was -- after the next getting together I went to____ and I talked to all the people there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and everything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, "Hide her if you can.” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Monfred's father had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they made cosmetics, I think, and soap bottles and all this little stuff, and the first night I spent -- I was hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And it was right close to <span class="BUILDING">Ann Frank</span> were -- the <span class="BUILDING">Ann Frank house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I mean it was on the same kind of a <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I don't know if it was on the Frank's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but it was on one of the <span class="DLF">canals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It was the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the same situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And I stayed there, but they weren't planning for me to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">They couldn't have people stay in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so some how Monfred had arranged for me to go to a paisson where the woman didn't know anything about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">She got my false papers and she thought I was that person and she registered me with the police under that name and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And I lived there and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They were taken in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at that paisson. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">That was -- that was my first <span class="NPIP">underground place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And I even got mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get suspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And she got my coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I went to <span class="BUILDING">ballet class</span> , a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course, not -- because Alice Kayser had already been picked up, so I went to a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I will tell you about that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I was no more hungry than anybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And Monfred and I became very good friends and, you know, I couldn't go to _____ anymore, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I was finished with that part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I was underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">My parents were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">You know, I forgot -- let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">My parents were picked up twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And the first time it might have been before I finally left, but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Maybe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It might have been before I finally left. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">That was when Ike said, "Now you need papers.” ___ </span><span class="sentence" id="846">said -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Yes it was before I finally left. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Again, I was sitting -- and was up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> with a girl from next door who was half Jewish, and we heard all that noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And there was this during the day and the green police were picking up everybody in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , everybody who was Jewish on that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And what they hadn't done -- they hadn't stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> and they hadn't stopped the trollies. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They hadn't stopped every -- anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">It was during the day and everything was going on normally and they were just having themselves a little rautsey_ there. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I -- the girl next door went over the <span class="DLF">roof</span> to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I went down and my father wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because it was a working day, you know, and I took off the J and I took my false papers and I went -- no, I didn't have false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I had nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And I went down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and again with the pig tail, you know, the whole works. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I came on the <span class="DLF">lower platform</span> and two German soldiers jumped up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And I was standing there in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Little German girl in pig tails. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Little bag that said <span class="BUILDING">gym class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And they said to me, "Get the Hell out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">We've got work to do" or some kind of thing. __ </span><span class="sentence" id="865">That's what they said.___. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And it -- and I went and then I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> and I went -- I went to -- to Ike __ <span class="BUILDING">mother house</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">mother's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And he -- they hid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And then when he said, "You need false papers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="871">That's how it was -- coming back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">That's when I got my first false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And his mother hid me for three days and during those three days I kept calling <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and finally, of course, I didn't get an answer because they had taken my sister and my -- and my mother, and my father, of course, went there -- there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They had taken them in some <span class="INT_SPACE">gym room</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> where they assembled them. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And at that time my father's paper which said that he was working for the Yotserat and had -- had given him a freedom a permit and he -- and they let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They let my family out. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And that was -- that was the first time they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Now, here I'm now going back to where I was in this paission. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">My mother at that time -- she had given some things to some Gentile neighbors below us. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">She had given silver, some clothes, some valuables -- things that she wanted to keep that she thought might be safer with them in case of an emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">She had given things to one of my uncles, Yohan ___, who later became the head -- the director of the big <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">paintings and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Anyway, I'm in this _paission and I'm going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And I hadn't seen my parents for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">We talked over the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I -- I'm very homesick, very homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And they are -- they want to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And it's -- it's going to be a holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">It's something we call ___, which I think is ____ but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It was about June 18th that I went there or June 19th, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And I -- Monfred says to me, "You are crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">You should not do such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">You never know what's going to happen, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I mean nothing has been announced. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He hasn't heard through his sources that anything's going to happen, but you just don't know and it's better not and why should you. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">You know, I had to put up a star and -- and a J to go to my -- to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I mean if the neighbors would see me without, you know, I mean, they would know that I was -- it was ___ It was terribly dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">It was stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">It was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And I did it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I -- I went to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , sewed on the J, lightly but I sewed it on, and I went to see my parents and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And, of course, there was a lot of crying and there was a lot of happiness that we were still there and we were still together and it's now 1943, June 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And everything goes fine that first evening and then the next morning at six, six o'clock -- in the letter that I wrote later, I write the right time a woman we used to call Cassandra came -- comes up and said, "I just heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">This whole <span class="REGION">area</span> is closed off and we're all -- this 1s the big deal for this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">All the Jews are going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">This is not a little rautsey by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">This is not by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">This is everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Everybody!" </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I was there! </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I was caught! </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I was -- I couldn't -- I mean it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">At the same time, you know, I was with my family and if anything happened to them, it would happen to me and this was it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And my mother said to my father, "Frans, _____,"" which means Frans, she goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">She has to leave, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I had my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I had my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Couldn't take a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">My father says to me, "Bless you. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Go. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">This is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I think this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">This really is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">This is the last time. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">This is it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="928">He said, "You go. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">You go. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Doesn't matter anymore, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Just try it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I didn't even think how fantastic that was, you know, that I had his -- at least at the last moment that he said I agree with you, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And not that it lessens the guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Really, it doesn't lessen the guilt of not being with them, you know, not participating in that thing that happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We had a hiding place in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> where there were two nice <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and there was a double wall and we had suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They used to be called elephants. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They were more like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> with a rounded top and they were grey, and that's why they're called elephants and on the back of one of those, my mother had made a handle, and she had made a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and you know, Susie -- she promised me she would put Susie in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I said to her, we will come and get her, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And you can go in there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">She had papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Monfred had gotten her papers, and had gotten Susie and -- and my father papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">He said, Monfred had said to me, "You father will never use them, but I don't want to have it on my conscious that he can't if he needs to, you know," and so as I left, you know, I said to them, "Put Susannah in -- in there, you know, in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Give her her papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Make her pull the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And you to___, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="947">All of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Go in there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And -- and, of course, they didn't, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They didn't even use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They didn't use the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They didn't use -- they didn't go in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Anyway, I went down -- down and it was a beautiful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It was like this morning except cooler you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Sunny, warm, June day in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Little clouds and -- It's so easy to close a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> off in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> because there are water everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Right! </span><span class="sentence" id="960">All you have to do 1s stand on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Just stand on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">You can stop anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I didn't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I had no where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I didn't know the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were closed off, so I went to the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And I went to the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and I saw there was somebody standing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And then I remembered that there were people from ____ where I had worked who had good <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , who were communists, you know, and who would certainly hide a little blonde girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And man, they were so angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">They told me I'm stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I was endangering them. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">How would I dare come to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, people might be watching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I'm coming into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- nobody else is on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and here's this kid walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and it's coming to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they have to be saved because they later on want to save <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="976">After the war, they want to make into a great communist country. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Or anyway they want to change <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into something good, and I was endangering them. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And away with me! </span><span class="sentence" id="979">That was the end of my communisms if I ever had any. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I'm telling you I didn't know what it was, but I -- right there, I knew that, you know, these people were no different from anybody else and it's dog eat dog and save yourself and, you know, I didn't think all of that right then. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I just knew I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">All of a sudden, loud speakers all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="983">All Jews had to prepare themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Gentiles are not allowed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Loud and clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">All over. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And I'm in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">The only person in the <span class="DLF">street</span> except for those damn people on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="990">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> going yet, because they gave them an hour or something to get ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So I was the only one on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Of course, there were people in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and they saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Right?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1115">For what she wanted! </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">She saw an ad in a paper for the upstairs of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the Valarstraat with a family of Anespairs -- actually Dutch fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And she went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And she said, "We would like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">We would very much like that and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and there will be various number of people because all of us travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you know, speaking German very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And this was a Dutch woman who could not speak German very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Her husband was an Anespair and -- and she and her son were living down <span class="DLF">stairs</span> while the guy worked for the Germans somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And that's how they got that first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So it was a pretty safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work -- live if you didn't give it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">If not something, you know, you couldn't have assemblies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">You couldn't -- you know, you had to take into account what kind of <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was, but all of us, nearly all of us -- of this particular group were not hidden away like Ann Frank was where you couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I mean we all were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">It was dangerous, very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I mean I was well known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">My family was well known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">It's not like now, millions of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">You -- you were very well known in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And I wasn't in the exact same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> south, but it was the old south, rather than the new south. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And I was not as well known there, except by a few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So the way they made your papers, your false papers -- they gave you the same first name that you really had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So if somebody would suddenly see you and yell, "Hey, Barbara," 1t would be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">You don't call each by the last name so you know -- so-- That's my paper -- my name always was Barbara, which was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">So that was why I went to see Monfred that night when we after -- or that morning after my parents were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Anyway, I heard that they were all taken away, and they -- again, they tried to get free with these papers, but the papers were now null and void. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">It was pass the period that these papers would do anything for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> , which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">In the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span> was already my cousin Heinz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I've told you about him and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">My cousin Heintz was hidden through the Dutch underground -- some kind of channel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The way -- the way it seemed to have happened was all through individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">There wasn't a great big organization where people all knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">It was one person knew another knew another knew another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">The less you knew the better, because if you get caught you can give away maybe one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Maybe! </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">If you were not tough as nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And this is what happened with my aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">They -- rather my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">They were hidden by a -- a Dutch family, and it so happened that the son of that Dutch family also did other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Most people who hid people were not allowed to do anything else, but they, of course, didn't know about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .planes that flew low, you know, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And he he was given away by somebody and they came to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took -- they took the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Just the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Not my cousin, my cousin Ava. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They didn't take her or the wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And Ava was immediately put somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">But Heinz was caught and he was then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">The -- This other person- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out in somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Let's come back to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  To me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> , and he, of course, he saw his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He saw my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">He saw my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He saw my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">He saw my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">All going through there! </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And Heintz did survive the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">There were very, very few people who did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">There were -- I think there were 300 at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And he was one of them who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And they actually kept him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his German business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> , which happened a heck of a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were trying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">What about me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">During the war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Because of the way I looked I could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And we had -- we hid a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And that really was -- after reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help themselves and each other staying alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that the underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but not with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">QUESTION:  Tell us about you!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  About me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">QUESTION:  I'm not interested 1n the book right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I want to know about you and what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I also did a few other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I was -- as -- as I say, they had to be careful with me because I was pretty stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And I -- they put me to work -- they put me -- I was a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And there was a ballet company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdan</span> run by Evan Geeorg1,- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans tn into the Dutch large state theater to run the ballet company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I went into her <span class="BUILDING">ballet school</span> and took classes and I was then asked to join the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I asked if -- the underground, "Was it alright?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Oh, Yes!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And that way I could help shift people from one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were underground -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And let me tell you how this was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">There were no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And there were very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , because there was no gasoline for them to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">So what they had was people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> pulling, you know, like in <span class="REGION">third world countries</span> , they would pull little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Some of them were covered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, people wouldn't get wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And others were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">All sorts of various ways of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And the few people that I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">With them being the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on top on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with make-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police stuck their head in there and saying, "What is this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Curfew is on -- you could -- I would have a smile and papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And I shifted a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">That way! </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">You know, from one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And I did little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Also, Monfred would distribute the ___ which was the communist newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, "You bring this to a certain little <span class="DLF">portal</span> with and just somebody will come and get it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I didn't know who was going to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I didn't know when they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">If they were there before me or after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I -- you know, I would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I would watch the <span class="DLF">portal</span> and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and not ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right people, I would walk up with the bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And if they took it, they were the right people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">If they didn't, I would walk on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly short of money of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">That was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And Monfred in his letter to me just now said that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry that was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">It was sold to Dutch people who, you know, wanted it as an investment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And the money was used for us to eat and -- and live, rent and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">We tried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work in those <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , not particularly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , just in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> while their own people went to the various <span class="NPIP">fronts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And we would mix-up these. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">We would have Frenchmen in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the French would say, "We were sent here to work in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and for the Dutch -- for the German industry," And the Dutchman in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would say, "But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the French industry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I mean it was a total mix-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Some people also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> if one would be able to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">But our Leo only took them to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Well, on his way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he would often bring suitcases full of lipsticks and , you know, all these wonderful French things that you couldn't get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And perfumes and other things that the French and that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And then me, I would be sent to sell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And I would go to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them downtown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And people would buy them like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I mean I didn't -- I sold them wholesale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I sold the whole suitcase full all at once, and we would eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And one time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I saw the Dutch police all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , watching -- in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Well, I knew enough, Thank God, not to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and -- and they had made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Of course, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I don't know what Monfred did, but he got rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments, you know, where you think, "Now, this 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">This is it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And also one time I drove -- rode my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> up a one-way <span class="DLF">street</span> the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I..I was really confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> and there was a lot of traffic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And I got stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And, of course, they looked at my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">By that time, I had much better papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told Evan that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but she knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Never! </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">She called -- did call me in and she said, "It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on further trips.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">She put that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">She never said, you know, "I put you into this company because you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">She said exactly what I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">She said, "A little more training would be good for you, so just go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">So that she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And the strange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Was a different group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">It was Maria Austria and her friend, ___—_—, who are all in the book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't want me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And I wouldn't listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And so that's how they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">They went and they told Yvonne Geoorgi about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorg1 which she had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I never did believe that was really a fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as much character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I -- who's going to throw the first stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">She didn't kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">She was good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's the big festival after we were liberated -- liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I was not allowed to march because I had worked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever said: But she did it because of the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">The underground didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Monfred didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Nobody -- I mean, Monfred probably didn't think it was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I thought it was terrible! </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this is after war stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was -- was, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Now we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">You were going to tell us a little more about your underground activities, particularly in smuggling packages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  I didn't smuggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I sent them by mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">The Germans would let you send packages to people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> , and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed to send a lot of packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Actually, we had mail from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Regular mail -- .regular mail from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And the mail I guess was read, but it was sent on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And they received everything I sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Nothing was dis -- had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew that they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I didn't know where they had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I heard they had been sent on, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And it now appears that it was in January of ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And it was -- it was a terrible shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">It was just really incredible shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And I also want to say that I think I survived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">It's the sort and it was exciting, you know, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and- Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">You know, since I couldn't be in the ballet anymore, I had to be good for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And besides standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I mean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply food, you know, get food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Was the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , the 91, you know, where we had been before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">This was now an 86. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of 80 -- number 86 in the Valarastratt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were right there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And then a very difficult time started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Very difficult! </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">First of all, we went into the hunger winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">You know the time that the south was liberated, south being <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braba</span> -- north Braba, and all those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And that only did <span class="REGION">provinces</span> around were still occupied and ____s was coming up along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and we were stuck in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Not only us, but also the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">They couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And this was the first time that they also had less food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They started to be hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And we started -- they started to be scared of the underground who had all the weapons -- had so many weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And they had weapons, but they were mostly old men and kids, you know, and it was just a very, very scary situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And during that time I had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had big <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And I met the neighbors from across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they were telling me that the people downstairs would go upstairs to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when we were out and steal the food out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Well, that was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">But we also were hiding people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And that was another thing! </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And the -- imagine them running into these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">So we had <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">You know, we had closets- what used to be <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> , was now papered over and there was an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> via the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and there was a rug that went up to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And, of course, the people we hid knew how to get into these <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Of course, the Germans weren't stupid either and if something was going in -- on, you know, if they did have a rautsea,, if they did have a check into various <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , they would stick their bayonets into the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and into the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and, you know, looking for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I lived with Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And he would give lectures in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very scary, and I started to be very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to Mon, "You know, I do not want this anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">This is my apart -- you know, I hired under my name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And these people, they will tell on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">We have to have him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">He also had to have his wife on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">So she was hidden somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">RIght? </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But on weekends, she came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> were told that the Germans were going to check into <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and in several in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So we had to move him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">We had to move him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And we moved him at night some -- to another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And then we had to clean up to see that they didn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women living in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">So we started -- we went into his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he had left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Cigars! </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">First of all, how did he have cigars? </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Nobody had cigars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Apples! </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Foods! </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Cheese! </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">We didn't give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">How did he get it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And when -- finally when all this was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when it was all over, I said to my friend, "I do not want this guy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">It's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I mean he was a hoarder, somebody who hoarded things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">We were supposed to share everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">This was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And he was a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">He should know how to share. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">Anyway, he -- I told Monfred, "he has to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And Monfred got very, very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">They beat up on me because they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, "Well, what can you do to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">You can't do anything anything to us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I said, "Yes, I can go to the police.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Can you believe it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I was just impossibly stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">I mean I was so desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">You know I thought we're all going to be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">You know, we're all -- and -- and I'll never forget that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">It was awful, and his red headed wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">So anyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course, the Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know, from -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would come flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">They were full of bombs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he might have a bomb left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And they would drop a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">So sometimes the Germans got one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and we got somebody to hide -- English, American, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">New Year's Eve, the American went on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and shot off his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">I mean I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Ohhhh! </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got to the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And they let the Red Cross drop food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> -- in and around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And the Red Cross -- we had flat roofs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">You know, the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> behind the decorations are flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">So they dropped cases of food on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> or in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> or in open <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , and the Germans were so scared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And the underground and -- I -- the food was distributed evenly, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your <span class="DLF">roof</span> , you know, you better take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And we were all starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We were really -- the bread was- had gone sour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And then the -- we heard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">I haven't told you about Akmier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1417">QUESTION:  I'd like you to go back and tell us about Akmier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1418">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And Monfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should, perhaps, if it was alright -- it was my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- right? -- </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Akmier should come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">Well, Akmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">Well we also arranged a girl for him to come that he might like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">We didn't want him to get into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to stay where he was he felt for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And the underground came to him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monfred</span> and said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is where he is now, we might have to send him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or anyway he'll be in deep trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And so they sent me to get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And I went over there I said you have to come and stay us and you have to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">You have to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">So Akmier came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And then I heard his whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">He -- he was a German -- was involved in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> story where the six people were hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an assembly in -- of <span class="BUILDING">Munich University</span> full of anti-Hitler propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And in one -- of course, they all got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">So -- so in one of their books was his name? -- </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name, and somehow they managed to get him out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">He had just finished his medical studies and he was sent to <span class="BUILDING">Villemina Hot Towers</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">mental institution</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and he was supposed to study further psychiatry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">He wanted to go into psychiatry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">So he studied there and worked there, and he started working with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">He got us a piece of soap once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">He he helped people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">He moved people from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to -- he did a whole lot probably that I don't even know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And then the Germans shifted him to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because there were big battles going on in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and they needed psychiatrists -- some people to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and once -- once he got there, the situation was so disastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers 1t was worthwhile fighting for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">It was worthwhile fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">It was ridiculous to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for him -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely lost his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">He just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">That was not his nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">He couldn't stand -- stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And so toward V-J day, he had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat</span> -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one person like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">He got to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ___ and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on -- on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you know, why should I have a mark like that on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And he went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he washed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> being shot, one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">Deserters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">Shooting the deserters! </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">He didn't have a zero on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and he made to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , he called the underground and the underground -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> had broken down so he had to walk a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> the -- the underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and hid him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much then because he could -- what could he do, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">He was, himself, endangered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And -- and then after the wa, Akmier stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">He got this -- you know, the Queen said he was a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">He didn't -- he worked as a psychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know, "Don't you share with others? </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?" “</span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Uh- huh.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">Just sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">And
QUESTION:  You and Akmier became involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1478">ANSWER:  We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">No, I -- I wanted children and Akmier did not want children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">He said, "This is not a world" -- this is one of the things that was done to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I mean, what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">He couldn't get passed it, shall we say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">He said this is not a world for -- for any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And he ended up marrying a woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">I mean he really looked for somebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood disease that she couldn't have any more children then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">He -- he -- it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">It really was so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">And he -- he had such talent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">You know, he played the violin, and he was very well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">His father was an incredible person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">His father -- there were three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">Now let me just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans. ______ </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">His father was the headmaster of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father called his three sons and he said, "There's only one God.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">They were all Catholic. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1495">There's only one God and he 1s not on this earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And there is only one law, and it's God's law.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">That's what his father said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">And all the boys were terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">I mean two of them did go to the front, but they all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">But I mean there are people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And he lost his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">The father was thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">But they needed teachers so bad, he ended up teaching, just plain old teaching then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">QUESTION:  Come back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">The war's end is approaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1507">ANSWER:  The war's ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">The war's ending, and people are showing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">People come popping out of the woodwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">My cousin, Ava comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">She says, "Here I am.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">And she told me they were all -- my cousins -- you know, I started learning who was alive and who was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1513">QUESTION:  Tell us -- tell us about the day of liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1514">ANSWER:  Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to absolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you know, or -- or blow up some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">But they had all these weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and they really wanted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were coming and -- and everybody went downtown to the Dom, which 1s the big place in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">And on the <span class="DLF">Dam</span> also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of the Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little <span class="DLF">street</span> apart, maybe 10 feet, 12 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">There was the German Officers Club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">And who was in this club? </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">Old guys and boys of 15! </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody had a big shotgun tn -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Palace</span> -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many people standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many Germans died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I mean it was totally useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">It was one of those things that happened in total confusion and fear on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , fear and loathing on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and just a horrible, stupid, awful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">You knew you could already go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">You knew you didn't have to be as afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">And they were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And they did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">They came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And I remember looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> coming and full of these healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">I -- I thought our -- our guys were great looking, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">I'd never seen so much flesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I mean it was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And, of course, we went out there and screamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">We just screamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And all my dance buddies, you know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">They all got boyfriends, and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">I, of course, had a friend and I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I had always been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any kind of soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">It was -- I mean it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">It was heavenly, and it was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Very, very scary! </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Because I didn't really know where I belonged then, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn because I got into the ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">The ballet 1945 was started right then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">It had already been started for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the Ballet 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">Then later we came to the States, Ballet Company, ________ grew out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And then they had a festival, a wonderful festival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And, of course, there were no lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">There was not yet any electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">By that time we had to go down and get water to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water in buckets and we were pretty starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">I mean during that we ate from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fox kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">We ate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> came up with, that's what we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">You know, you had three little pots and one of you had to go and get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained much more than the people who formerly had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">It was very, very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">And the articles in the paper were a riot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">But hunger was not funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And we would go up and get up in the morning and have -- have a ship's cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things, and we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">I was always cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">I can stand hunger better than cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">It was terribly cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- we would go all in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and put everybody's blankets and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on top of us and we still were cold, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only cold water to wash with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat -- heat the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , which by the way was the only thing to cook on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">Remember gas wasn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and -- and we brought -- we had a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> full of peat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And we used the peat to -- to cook on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> which was just a little heating, which also heated the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">And that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And one night I caught 84 fleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">I killed 84 fleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">I mean we were covered, and actually we didn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">I mean I don't think there even. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">I mean it was just in total disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">We were hungry, cold, and full of fleas by the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">It was outrageous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">And then there was this wonderful festival where they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at night we had lights and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> were laid across the <span class="DLF">canals</span> and you could walk from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> from one __ to the other just over -- over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">I was in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">It was the most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">And I didn't think -- I didn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">And then afterwards, I said, "Now what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">Now what?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">They are lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">Well, Monfred said to me then, "Don't believe it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">And I -- I already hated him with a passion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Because he had done all these horrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">And he said, "Don't believe it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">And I said, "I'm going to believe it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">We then knew -- we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">In ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">So I started going to the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">And, of course, I stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">When I had the time, I stood there and I stood there and I stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">I asked -- and when I see these films, you know, they are films made by the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">They were wonderful French films, but and -- and they're these people going to -- other people coming out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you know, and they have their shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and you ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so? </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Did you know so and son? </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's name to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">I'm sure of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">And recently somebody showed up with my sister's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">I mean there was nobody to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I had girlfriends who met Americans and who married them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And I was waving goodbye to them because they were marrying American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">What do the American soldiers know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">They know nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">And if they had known, what would it have mattered? </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">They were in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">You know, such 1s human nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1626">QUESTION:  We need to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Can you tell me just tell me what, very briefly, what you did now and -- .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1628">ANSWER:  Well, after the war, of course, I -- I worked for two years in the <span class="BUILDING">Ballet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">I danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">That's how I make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">And I started to realize that every time I got a job, they had to ask for a work permit because I was not a Dutch citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And it was a lot of work for them and bless them, they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">I mean I did not -- I thought I wouldn't have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">I can get another girl, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">But I always had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">And Akmier, of course, was working by that time, and so we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski, also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> who was -- 1S quite a well known psychiatrist here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> I think -- .[ </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">went for shock treatments and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">And Lotta was looking for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">I had gone to my older <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- our -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I lived with my family and had told the woman there where I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me look in the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> that we had around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">And, of course, she'd found the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">There was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">And then the woman below us, who was a fascist during the war, she said, "I saw you got on -- you know, it was dangerous for her -- dangerous period for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">She might have been shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or killed by the where all the Dutch wanted to take revenge on their people -- and she said, "I didn't give you away when you ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">You helped me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">And I said, "You were helped enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">Because she had a lot of our stuff, and I didn't get anything back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">So I -- I said, "I won't give you away, just like you didn't give me away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">And that was all I ever did for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">I didn't give her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">I said, "If they catch on to you, that's not my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">I don't -- you know, it's your.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">Anyway, I got a -- I got a lot of mail from all over the world, from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , from -- all -- all over the world where people had managed to escape to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">And one of the letters I got was from the Kanaski's and they asked me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">At the time I was in the Ballet and I was with Akmier and I thought Akmier would get over the fact that he didn't want to have children, which I knew I had to have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">So I said to Kanaski, let's wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">Let's wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">He said, "I'll give you an affidavit and you come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">And he kept coming by because he -- he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">He helped set up the free university of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as psychiatry -- department of psychiatry there, and giving lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">So he came every year two or three times and he said, 'Now you must come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And made -- he sent me the affidavit and made me sign it, and by that time I thought it would be better and that's how I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">He was very -- they were very good to me -- very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">And I also have other family here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">They were also good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">So -- and I worked as a ballet -- as a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And that's it! </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1669">QUESTION:  I want to thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">Very much!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1671">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">You don't want to know I have four children.</span></p>
