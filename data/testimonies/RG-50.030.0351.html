</span><span class="sentence" id="1318">What would you do if somebody — something like that happens to your wife or your sister or mother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">So they let her go.

id="1331">But after a while, the law came that you cannot steal or take anything anymore, so what we did — there was no food, no <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go shopping, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The only great thing was you had freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">You could breathe, and I thought that's best in the world what you can get after — that we are alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So I went to see that man [Tibor] who was that friend who was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">My Christian lady [landlady] took me to him, and I was happy that he's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">We didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And he took over an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> because he had two years of medicine already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And he said it's horrible, no drugs, and he had to take the bombs — the shrapnel out of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Cold freezing <span

class="sentence" id="1342">So while he was going to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , curing the people, and if he saw somebody's very sick even before, he took his identifications away and gave it to someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I was waiting for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Kitchens on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">But from the morning to the night I could wait for a cup of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">But after a while, we decided we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeged</span> , plenty food, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — a <span class="BUILDING">doctors’ university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I wouldn't be hungry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">But they didn't put me in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">You know, they just took away my blackmail — or <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">There it was already food plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Plenty food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeged</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I didn't want to dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I still — I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> overnight, three weeks on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And Red Cross occasionally stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and gave us soup or something, so in three weeks I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> traveling on the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Soldiers went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">The soldiers didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">They

class="sentence" id="1363">So then they went back on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> what I went on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, of course, there 1s — we owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , and my mother still owed money on that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">So I stayed till I could make — pay off the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">So I was dreaming, I wasn't believe it that somebody's coming back, they should have at least a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">So I went in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they hit me, why I didn't stay with the — why I didn't die with the Nazis, because the Christian woman took over. </span><span
