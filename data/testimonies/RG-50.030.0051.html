<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I'm Alice Lok Cahana.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarvar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That's not far from the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What year were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  1929, February 7th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Would you tell me about your family and your very early childhood 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarvar</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  It was a very community-oriented family. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My grandfather was a very interesting, self-made industrialist; and he...the community really loved him, and he was elected every year to be the community leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And it was a very caring family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The rabbi used to come in, lunch time, and...and discuss with him the public affairs; and Grandfather was always available. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He was, for me, a very, very beautiful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He used to tell me stories, and ask me to write stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I had...I just really, really loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And when Grandmother died in 1939, I felt such a special compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I must take somehow care of Grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And always asked him, "Let me do something for you for Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Let me do...." And he says, "I'm all dressed." </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When I looked down and I said, "But I think your shoe needs some shining." </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And he said, "No, you are too big for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I, I couldn't permit you." </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I said, "Please, Grandfather! </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I just...let me do just something for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Grandfather was so very special for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And a very compassionate, wonderful man who took care of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Who took care of the orphans of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Anybody who would get married and didn't had family, Grandfather was taking care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So it was an open <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the community, in a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">What were they like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Father was a very elegant, very kind, wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Mother had a great big responsibility to take care of the four children, because Father was travelling a lot to business. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Actually every week, went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And so Mother had a hard responsibility to raising the children; and she was, I think, very stern, very demanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had to know always who we are, and there were a lot of restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And, you know, when you're young and...and separate so tragically as we separated, you really don't have a good picture at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You don't...you have a very distorted picture, of your mother particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh, you didn't came to terms about how you was accepted, or...or...so that it's very hard for me to give any kind of picture of Mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I just remember one of my rebellious natures about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">On Mother's Day, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was asked always to...children were in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> asked to perform; and I remember the last Mother's Day, I got a poem about a very soft, gentle, loving mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I felt, "It's a mockery. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">This is not my mother, and I will not read this poem!" </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I chose a poem about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that are cut so suddenly down, and it's a very beautiful poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Until today I remember, because I didn't told my teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I didn't told anybody that I will change the script, and I will just say this poem about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that are cut down so terribly harshly, and what is their sin. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Almost like I would speak about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that was taken away so suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> almost replaced this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But, of course, we did not know anything nearer to it before, what will happen to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But the poem was so interestingly prophetic about this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that it will be erad...eradicated; and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> will all gone and the...and the birds will not sing anymore, and what is the sin of this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So you can imagine the surprise of my mother, the surprise of my teacher, when I'm coming and talking about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So you... you see, I wasn't clear, really, about the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">If I could fashion her that time, probably I would made her extremely tender, extremely soft; but later I knew how important it was that she was firm and stern, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And it was almost her sternness, her demands were almost an education in survival, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I don't know how to tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But in very early stage of...of the tragic upheaval in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , a drunk man came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and says, "You know, you will all be taken out, and you will be all...all be burning up, and so....". </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He said some horrible words. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I got so frightened, I pretended that I faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I just was...it was...just fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And Mother--instead of taking care of this man, taking him out from <span class="BUILDING">household</span> --she came over first and slapped my face, and said, "In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we don't faint." </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Well, that was good education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we didn't fainted either. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And so maybe in that respect, if I...1 should apologize to my wonderful mother who really gave me a little survival instincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Tell me about your.... Here's a kleenex. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Tell me about your brothers and sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I had an older sister, who was two and a half year older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Her name was (clearing throat) Edith. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Edith was brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">She was very, very intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Edith wrote poetry, and Edith helped already in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ; and she was very self-sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I was meek and shy and afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Edith was brave and not afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And she was always my shield, my strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And Edith already earned a salary in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and her first purchase was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And she was so proud of her purchase; and the first thing that the Germans, when they came in, took away were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and the radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And it was very, very hurting. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was so tangible; because we...we just were not prepared for anything so brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That somebody comes into your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and takes out items, and says, "That you cannot have. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That's not yours anymore, no matter how precious that is for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And in the beginning it was really just items, but later it was life, [you know? (</span><span class="sentence" id="83">ph)] We didn't knew it in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So for the whole tragedy, there wasn't much preparation in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">If there was any voices from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was pretty much shielded. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Our family was even more protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Our children...we did not know that anything horrible can happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">For me, it felt that our family lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Everybody knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Everybody knew who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We knew where our <span class="NPIP">place</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So there was an order that I never felt could be broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Summers we would go to summer vacations, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balaton</span> [a <span class="REGION">resort area</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> in <span class="REGION">western Hungary</span> , 55 miles southwest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ]; and in...1t was an industrious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was a productive family. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Even if we were wealthy, it wasn't...that was not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Everybody kind of had to do a task or that task, and be helpful in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Your brother, too? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You had a brother...
ANSWER:  And we had two...I had two little brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, because Mother had this task, I have decided I will be the the mother of my little brother; the younger one. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The older one was too close to me, and I didn't have any jurisdiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But the little one, I could be the mother; and I adored that little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">His name...my older brother's name is Ocsi, and the younger was Imi. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And Imi was three and a half year old when we went to the (cough)...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and he was so adorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I used to pretend that I'd play <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and...and he's really my...my baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I will shield him, and I will play mother all the time; and be that mother that I wanted my mother really should be: very tender, very loving, very caring. (</span><span class="sentence" id="106">Clearing throat) All four of us one day found ourself in a calamity we could not imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was reading a book--Stefan Zweig's book, The... The Restless Heart-- and I thought, "Oh, they say that they will take us to a journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I will save this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It's a wonderful romance. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I will read it on the journey." </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Because when you travel, you take a book and you read. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Not knowing where they take us, how they take us; and that uh they really will reduce us, slowly, to animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And everything came in degrees; steps, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And you always said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Really, it's not happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It can't happen in the 20th century." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">First telling you that you have to leave your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You are going, and they say the word, a very strange word. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was nothing in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They're taking you to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Uh let's go back just a little bit, alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Uh, because I want to know really how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When did things...before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when did things begin to change? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What was it like when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But it came gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Degrees, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And to a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it came slower than to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where you had radios all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And...and we knew the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We knew that there were refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh, poor people always came. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Almost every day we had some visitor who sat at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and told stories what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Sometimes we didn't believe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Sometimes we felt they're just telling us story to get, maybe, the meal or something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Then...and now we couldn't have help any more in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And we...we got a Jewish girl, who was a refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ; and she used to tell me stories that she had to go flee in the middle of the night, and she couldn't find her boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she just found one boot and she went with one boot, crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> over into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I couldn't imagine such a horrible thing; that somebody in the winter who... who walking in one boots to cross the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But we always felt so very protected; and Grandfather would say, "Look, maybe it happens in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is civilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We are very good taxpayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They need us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It will not happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And then one day, they say that you pack up twenty-five kilo. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">What is twenty-five kilo? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">What do you take? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Your pots and pans? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Your photographs? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Your...food? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I remember that day, that Mother send me to somebody, to a neighbor, to get a recipe about uh certain--like toll house cookies, that you just spoke about a few minutes ago--because for the trip that would keep longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I thought to myself, "Gee, I don't even like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Why would we take...? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I would never eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I mean, it's just so dry." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So I went and got the recipe; and so Mother and the help and all, they're baking up these toll house cookies or whatever, they.... It was some some kind of a bread kind of thing (cough) for the journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Prior to that, there was talks about rumors that maybe they're taking us to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And so quickly Mother enrolled to a class, baking class. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I don't know from where they...some of the women got the information that they ...that they need to be bakers, or maybe they.... I don't know what was the logic. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Anyhow, somebody gave a class on baking...a baking class. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And the class was held at the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I used to transcribe the recipes for Mother, for all this fancy, wonderful bakers...bake...baking goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So those are the recollections that I have, that we knew that something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But really nobody, nobody had imagination; and then (clearing throat) to...to really believe the extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then because of Grandfather position, they arranged a special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a couple of people...uh, where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was, opposite the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I had a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I will show it a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And...and so it was the <span class="BUILDING">school-house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we were in the <span class="BUILDING">schoolhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Some people in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ...the way they divided the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they build a <span class="DLF">wooden wall</span> one end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the other end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="172">Clearing throat) And it was a (cough) kind of a narrow passage with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi's house</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and uh two more <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And um...the Jewish butcher who...who lived behind the...the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So this was one ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that they divised was in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , that the rest of the community went. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And we had some permissions to go out twice a week to the market-- that was probably ten minutes away--to buy some food in the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But it wasn't any warm water; so when we were there for about a week, I had an idea--I always loved children very much--to gather all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There were about ten...ten, twelve children--and take them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ritual bath</span> ; because it wasn't any warm water to wash them for "Shabbat." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But I didn't dare to ask my mother, because she wouldn't let me and we couldn't go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> only with permission and she wouldn't let me to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I mean, 1t was not in my position to go and speak to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But the soldier who was watching us was a little bit bored; and I went over to him and said, "Look at the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Look how dirty they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">What do you think, I will take them out; and I promise you, I promise you I'll bring them back in half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Just wash them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ritual bath</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And to my great amazement, he permitted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And so, without Mother's knowledge, I assembled the children and took them out; and sure enough, we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And Mother didn't found out, so I felt very, very lucky; because you can imagine the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And then I had another idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Why don't I take the children into the <span class="DLF">garden</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> --that was just secluded--and I and Edith will be the kindergarten teacher, and we'll teach them songs and play with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So Edith was wonderful, because she right away felt this is a very good idea; and also said, "Let us not say it to Mother, because she will not let us. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She will not let us do it, because she will say, ‘It's too much work, or, 'Something may happen to the children or to you.' </span><span class="sentence" id="193">She will not agree. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It's...it's our...." So in a way, we started to be very independent and kind of rebellious, and continued to do that even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And...and sure enough, we had the children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And one day the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens as we are singing and the children are in a circle, and Mother comes in with a bowl of cherries. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">She went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They let her out, and she brought the bowl of cherries to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So she knew all the time what we are doing; and those were the most wonderful cherries I ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I never, never had anything so wonderful since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And so, Mother knew Edith and I were the kindergarten teachers of these children; and it was now Official that we took care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So one day they say that (cough)...now, that special ...special permission is not granted anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We also going over to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And we went over, and...for one night, and we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> ; and the next morning they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Marching through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like a scene out of the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">From ancient time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I could not tell you the humiliation I felt; carrying our baggage, passing our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , looking into our <span class="DLF">window</span> , seeing the people who occupied our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looking at us, and nobody stopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They marched us to the railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Nobody says, "Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">You cannot do it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="211">On a June day, 1944, 20th century men cannot be just taken from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , from their belonging, marched into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , seventy people. (</span><span class="sentence" id="212">Cough) Before they marched us all in, they took the men to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So when Father found out that they're taking the men to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , one morning he got up and said hastily goodbye to us; and said, "Just don't forget who you are," and, "Escape." </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Those are the two words I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And he went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ;

but we, the family, (clearing throat) were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> in the hottest day with one sanitary bucket for seventy people--seventy to seventy-five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Our bundled (cough) luggage piled on top of each other; realizing that we have not even <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> , or very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I tried to be close to the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I remember I was standing all the time; because it was almost just maybe room for squatting down where you were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But really no <span class="NPIP">sitting place</span> ; and Edith next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">At the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I asked the soldier if he would let us go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He said, "There's no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> here, but you can go behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I remember that it was (clearing throat) very funny feeling to be moment free, and look at the <span class="DLF">sky</span> ;

at [Vecsés (ph)], and we suddenly understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I could see through the blinds that some people--three people--jumped down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And, of course, the SS right away after them; and I think they caught two of them with the...and shot them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So even if the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> could not see--the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> inside--I saw all what happened, because I was so...you couldn't move away from your <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Wherever you was positioned, you was like plastered; and it was a little plank there open, and I could see through and also a little bit through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I saw how they dragged this man that they caught with their dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I witnessed first time that savage brutality that really was the lead in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped again, we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">This horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Everybody in strange uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I told Edith, "It looks that they took us to the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Somehow, somebody will come and apologize. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Somebody will say it's totally wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You don't belong here. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">This looks like an <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">People are shaved heads and striped clothes." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So since we couldn't comb our hair and Mother was so very "Pedant" [German word meaning a person who is meticulous or precise], Mother said, "Put a handkerchief over your head, you know, and come down from the...from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I had my little brother, who couldn't find his shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I was trying to tell him that he has to be more orderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">A three and a half year old must find his shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was no time to look for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Just had to go down, line up in five. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And fast, and rapid. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And anybody who couldn't go was just hit by the stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was like madness. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I (cough) lined up;

and Edith came and brought over the can of food, or brought back the empty can of food--the empty can (cough) that went over before with the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And so Edith and I were reunited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was such a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I just knew that I never want to be without her ever, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And we cling to each other; but 1t was very risky because it was started to be selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And the man who selected me into life, I found out later, was Mengele; because he came often to select. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Sometimes he looked at people with small hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Sometimes he looked for blue-eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Sometimes he looked children who were tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Sometimes children who were short. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was always an upheaval when Mengele came. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He was so elegant, and he looked so good;

(snapping fingers)..."life"..."death." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He just with his hand motioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">One day Edith said, "You know, I don't feel good anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I don't feel good." </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And our little friend, Ibi got very delirious from the same bad <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plank bed</span> ; was the plank board that we shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And Ibi started to talk words I couldn't understand, and was...she had terrible high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And anybody who was sick or had any kind of rash or something was selected in the morning out. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Sometimes they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Sometimes they took them somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">This morning they took Ibi. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And then the next morning, Edith says, "I...I feel sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You must let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I must go into the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I begged her, "Edith, you can't! </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They will take you!" </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But somehow they saw her, that she was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">She couldn't stand up for the counting. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And they took her to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> ; but by now I was veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I knew when is the best time to go away from group, when I can go in and see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So every morning I would go in to Edith and see her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">See Ibi, my friend, totally in delirium; and see Edith getting higher and higher fever every... every day.

<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  Of course we didn't know, you see; because they told us that it's a shower, that we go for disinfection, that we'll get warm clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I checked out this story very carefully later. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I met two of my friends who survived from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ; and I told them my story about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And one of them told, "I was there, too!" </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, I know only that it was dark, that the Germans were terribly nervous, that when we came out they were very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They throwed some clothes, not our own clothes, back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Nothing was, of course, disinfected or warm or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We were...we couldn't understand the chaos, their anger, their bewilderness, their shouting--"That never happened before!"--and marching us angrily back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But very soon after, we knew where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The fabric of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> started to slowly break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">The order. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The closer the Allies got, more chaos came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">The food was not distributed anymore in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">The...the nervousness of the...the SS was just very felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I remember Irma Grese. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Irma Grese was the SS--the supervisor, the most beautiful woman, like a statue--who would come and count us. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">She was a pair with Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">When the two of them appeared, it was terror and fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It was... always meant death. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And Irma Grese would...her blond hair, beautifully coiffeured, and her beautiful shirt--blue shirt, starched and clean and crisp--and her...and the way she walked, made us even more feel that we are less than animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We are not human beings anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We don't have individuality. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We don't have...we don't have nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And the chaos was bigger and bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Mengele didn't came anymore, and Irma Grese didn't came, and...came anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they say that selections...and the selections went on and on, and fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And one night, (sniffle... cough) we were Selected. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It...I told Edith, "Wherever you will be selected, I will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I will go." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I am...I was younger, and I can't... could..."I somehow will go after, don't worry." </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And we found somewhere...somebody gave us a little red bead, tiny red bead. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We used to put on our cheeks to look a little healthier; and the red bead went around in that...you know, in that circle, so everybody used it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I don't know how much it helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We didn't have a mirror. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We didn't hardly look. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But anyhow, the selection was very swift and very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">It was an SS woman selecting. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I saw that Edith was selected to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And we were so emaciated, so skinny by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And I had an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I said to the German woman, I came in front of her, "It's my birthday today." </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And she put her hand one way, and then shifted to the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And it was like (snapping fingers)... like a moment; and I was motioned toward Edith. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And that selection was a very good selection, because they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guben</span> [a subcamp of Grofi Rosen, located in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> (<span class="REGION">Brandenburg Province</span> )]. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We traveled through the night, and arrived to in [Darseose (ph);

<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  It was a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We had to go early in the morning to work in an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We worked until late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We got some food, and could go to...to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Uh... was again with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We were again together with children; and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were much smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It was a...i1t was a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Anything...you can compare nothing to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It looked to me that it's a safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> , even if we had to work very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And it was very difficult with the big machines, but it wasn't so harsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Except the weather that you had to march to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But one day close to Christmas times, the SS came in and told us that we have to decorate the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And anyone who will decorate it the best, any <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> who...who will look the best, will get a prize. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So we were children and we wanted the prize so much; but we looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">There was no paper, no pencil. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Nothing to decorate with. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I told Edith, "I have a great idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I know how we decorate the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We will choreograph ourselves as candelabra; and when the SS comes in to...to count us, or to see the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , we will be the candelabra and we will be the art." </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So Edith said, "Well, it's not the best idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But I think.... We...we will talk to others also." </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So we talked to all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And we had one broom to clean out that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; and I took the broom and I gave everybody a piece of the broom to hold up. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And we choreographed ourselves as a living candelabra. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We were the recipient of the award for the decorated <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And guess what was the reward: a tiny little can of snails. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But Edith was so intelligent and so smart; and she said, "You know, this is so wonderful; because only the most enlightened people eat this kind of very elegant food. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I mean, you wouldn't know what this is, of course, but this is just a delicacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We will not eat it now, but we will eat it on your birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">When you have in February your birthday, we will open the can. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The magic can." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">In February,’ we were already on the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">The death march was going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the middle of the winter in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , without underwear, without socks, without coat; just a blanket what we had to wrap around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Somebody maybe had a coat, but a very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And this is how they...we had to march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">At night, whenever the cattles....the cattles were taken out from the...from the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , we were housed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And next moring and we would have to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Once we arrived to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It was not covered with snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It was a <span class="DLF">field</span> , and I remember they let us for a minute sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And the grass were eaten up in a matter of seconds. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We were that hungry, that the ...that little grass that was ' Probably February 1945.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And (cough) one day the chief doctor came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and said, "If I will bring you the best news of your life, will you promise me you will be alright?" </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I was so weak, he didn't wanted to tell me any kind of news. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I promised him. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And says, "I have a telegram from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangier</span> , where your relatives lived, that your father is alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I was so weak that he was..he came by himself; because he was so worried that the good news may just finish me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But it was such an incredible news, because, you know, that it had to be shared with all the girls in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">With...with everyone, because so few of...of us had anybody who came back who was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So in a minute the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> knew that my father is alive; and I ran around, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I got up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I was...I felt like I'm healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I[...1 can walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And the doctor said, "Just take it easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Don't...don't...don't dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Don't run around. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Don't..." It...1t was just unbelievable that somebody from the family is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">It was such an incredible mixed feeling, because actually the death--you didn't accept it totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You always hoped that Mother is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You always hoped that (cough) you will find your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">You always hoped that...that somehow something about your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I mean, forever played games with your brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But when something so concrete as a telegram came.... So I started to get first a letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangier</span> ...from the relative, Mrs. [Renée] Reichman. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And...and then later, from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And so Father wrote that he would like I should come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> as soon as the doctor lets me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I could barely wait to...to...for that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The Swedish people were incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They were so gentle and good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I felt like I...1 woke up in...1n <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">After this brutality, after...after this horror, after this inhumanity, to come to a civilized <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that three hundred years didn't have any war. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Who...who.... Volunteers come into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They bring us a magazine, and we should show them from the magazine-- because we couldn't speak Swedish--what food we want to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I mean, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , what incredible people! </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was like angels gliding. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They would organize concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I would hear music. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They didn't know how to make our lives whole again. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Such magical, wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">This family connected--the family that sent the telegram connected also us to a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , who had a representative in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> who wasn't Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And this representative got a telegram that there is a, that there is a...this little girl here in one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> ; and please look him up, it's part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And this wonderful Swede, instead of sending his secretary or sending a letter, he got in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But you know, we were so sick that...that we were taken from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They couldn't figure out; we had every illness there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So they always sorted out us--children with tuberculosis, people with tuberculosis went to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So when he arrived to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I was already in another <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; and he kind of repeated two, three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">When he catched up with me, he said, "You know, ..." Um, the nurse came in and said that there's somebody from my family here. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I said, "I don't have family. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I have nobody." </span><span class="sentence" id="604">She said, "No, you have to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">You...you.... Somebody is waiting for you <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I was so...still so frightened; to be taken out from the group meant total insecurity, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">You are sick...only if you are in a group, if you are nobody.... And so anyhow, the nurse coaxed me out; and she said, "This is this gentleman, and he says he's related to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And he explained that that he's not related, but he's the representative of my relatives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I guess that nurse and that...that the uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> asked this gentleman to look after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And this gentleman--who was so humane, so incredible, magnificent, wasn't a Jewish man--instead of sending letters or trying through the telephone, he went and and he...he found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And he said, "Look, I have a daughter just like you, your age. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">You come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and get to know her." </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I said, "No, I'm still sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">The doctor won't let me go." </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And he says, "Just come in then for a weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Get to know Mary. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">She's a very good girl." </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I thanked him very much; but I didn't wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And it took me a little while, after that he left, to see what a gentle, wonderful man this was, who came and with such gentleness tried to coax me back to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And... and then when the doctor permitted, and when I was a certain weight and...and I could really go, the doctor permitted and I visited them. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And I met Mary. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And it was so magical this summer, because I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and I met Mary again and we recalled this unbelievable time. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">How his [her] father brought me back and reconnected me with everything that was humane in the most gentle, most wonderful fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And I told Mary the story of the hat....
QUESTION:  Look at me if you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  I met...I was several times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> after that, and this wonderful Mr. [Gustaf] Haggberg-- Haggberg was his name--would take me to the opera, would take me to the most beautiful <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Would show me the word "freedom," how civilized man behaved, show me how to be without prejudiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And I made a vow: "If I ever grow up, I will be like Mr. Haggberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I will not hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I will not be prejudiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I will learn to love the world again, and all people." </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And one day after a correspondence with my father, we decided that I should come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> to say goodbye to Mr. Haggberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And Mr. Haggberg looks at me and says, "Alice, do you have a hat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You know, I don't have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I don't have a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I am nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I...my hair barely grows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I have one dress. "</span><span class="sentence" id="639">A hat? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">No, I don't have a hat." </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He said, "Alice, you cannot travel through Europe without a hat! </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You have to have a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You are a young lady now." </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And he rings the bell and rings Vera, the secretary; comes in and says, "Vera, you must go right now and buy a hat for Alice. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">She cannot travel through Europe without a hat!" </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And so we went into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the first little "chapeau" that came--a brown little "chapeau" that came to my hand--I put it on and...and bashfully said, "That's perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Thank you." </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And that little hat was my dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He gave back my dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and I met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And was an incredible reunion on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And very soon he told me that he really is getting married the next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And it was for me a very difficult...difficult moment, to realize that Mother is really not coming back, that Father's life must go on the way he wants it to, to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And that perhaps I shouldn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I decided very soon after that I should really not live in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , that I really should go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It was no "altyah." </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It was no possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I went up to one of the the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It was B'nai Akiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I told them that I must go, illegal or what; and anyway, I must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I must go away from here, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And they say that there is a Brichah, there is a group of people that will go in a certain time; but I have to have a lot of documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I have to have a lot of...because they are totally illegal, and they go from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And that they are...that this group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is not responsible if we will arrive to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or no. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But that's my only chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So I had to find all the documents; and they were very difficult, because Father.... I didn't want that Father should know yet that I am going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because he wouldn't hear of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He just wouldn't hear of it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="670">Cough) And I know that I have no future, that I must go away; that if...1f there is anything left for me in life, then it's not...not there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I must find my way. (</span><span class="sentence" id="672">Cough) And I went up to this group of people; and I told them very strongly that if they don't help me to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , then I don't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I just don't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And the young man who sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> was very sweet and very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He says, "Don't do anything drastic things here. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">At least not here." </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So he was smiling, and he says, "I will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But it will be very difficult for you, because your father has to sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">You are a minor yet, and he has to sign for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And we have to make you a false passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So you have to get all the papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So I have to...had to go to all the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And one day two men came up and told my father to sign; and Father was still under the spell of the Germans, in fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">He signed before he read what he's signing; and he was signing that I can go on "altyah" illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And, of course, when he realized he was very, very sad; and said, "Look, you can't leave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">You are my only child." </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And I told him that he had to start his life the way he started, and I must now chart my life the way I have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And my future 1s in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And he must...he must let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And so very tearfully we went in to the notary; and he was crying, and I was crying, and he signed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I got a telegram in the middle of the night that eight o'clock in the morning I should be at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and just find so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and a mother was running after me and says, "Please take care of my child." </span><span class="sentence" id="694">You know, I was always tall and always looked older than what I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And so I said, "Your child? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Where is your child?" </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And here was a girl. "</span><span class="sentence" id="698">My gosh, she's older than I am! </span><span class="sentence" id="699">She's eighteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I'm not eighteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">She should take care of me, maybe." </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And the mother said, "No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">You just take care of her." </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I said, "OK, I do." </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And so we got up on that on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and was a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">You know, it was a lot of people who went with; they're supposed to be together, but they were not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , where one of...a tiny baby died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So we had to bury the baby under the wheels of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And her death already was such a tragic mood that all of us who were there...we just...we just couldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">In the middle of the night we boarded The Exodus; and we got on the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bakar</span> [a small <span class="DLF">port</span> five miles east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijeka</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And it was terribly scary because it...several kilometers we had to walk 'til the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , in the dark of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Just a lamp pointed the direction, a hand lamp, because we were illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">It was still under...I[srael was not...<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was still not <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and we were right away selected out to...to...to guard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And, you know, selection was always scary; but this time I really wanted it...to guard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I had no idea what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And they gave me a gun, and I said, "Did you ever had a gun before? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I don't even know what to do with this!" </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I says, "Never before. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And we are guarding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , you and I?" </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I couldn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exodus</span> was a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and still in terrible danger of being attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">You know, The Exodus went several times back and forth to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="724">Cough) And so the second day on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , somebody tells me, "There is a girl who went crazy on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and cries that she will be thrown into the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So I went to see the girl; and this is the girl whose mother told me to take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So you can imagine what I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So I said, "There must be a doctor on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I went up to the doctor; and again, in German, trying to explain to him that there's a girl whom I'm in charge of who has to be taken care because... because she's sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And um doctor said, "You don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">This is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that will be attacked very soon on the open <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and we have no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for anybody who 1s insane." </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And shortly...the, the...the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> , you know; maybe for four or five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Says, "There's no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> here for anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So I have to keep this...and I said, "No, I give the promise for this mother, and I will do.... I will not leave until you promise me to take care of this girl." </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He says, "Well, if you bring her up...." After, you know, it was negotiating back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">After a while, he said, "If you bring her up, I will take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Let's see what I can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I pulled that poor girl screaming, screaming and hollering--she was sure I will throw her into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , you know--she didn't wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And we went up; and I told the doctor that I'd stay with her until until we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="739">I will be her private nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">You don't have to go worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Give me the medicine, and I will stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And then after a while, the captain of The Exodus came; and he looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He says, "I hear that you are giving orders on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I said, "No, I'm not giving orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But this was a mother...I, I made a vow to this mother that I would take care of her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And here it is, and I'm staying with her until we arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So nobody has to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I'm taking care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I'm here from morning to evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I just go down to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I'm with her all the time, so you don't worry." </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So the captain went away, and he was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Every day he came back, and every day he told me a little story about The Exodus. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So I found out that this was the youngest captain ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And that...that the...the run before us, the English came up to look for him, for the captain; and he was so young and he was so very good humored. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And he put on the captain's uh hat, and he said, "Do you think maybe I am the captain? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I don't know...we don't know where the captain is. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We didn't saw the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Maybe I am the captain." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So the English kind of dismissed him, and never thought that he could be the captain of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And they never found him; and he told me this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And so....
QUESTION:  Time 1s...time is a little short. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">The tape is.... Tell us about arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So anyhow, we arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And you can imagine to arrive into the promised land, and how are the feelings; but here I have this girl, and what will happen to her now? </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And the captain said to me, "Now leave your luggage here. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">You go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">You and the girl go. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And she's going to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and you take her to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there." </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I'm arriving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and that...with the shrieking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> up on the top of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mt. Carmel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And this doctor asked me, "What's her name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I have no name. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I don't know her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I don't know who she is. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I thought this will be one of those stories like my sister, who got lost...no name. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And I just broke down and I cried; and I had no idea what I will do, because I couldn't give any information about the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But then a couple of weeks later in front of a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> , I met the girl reunited with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And this is probably the most beautiful story I can tell how we took care of our refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Because a girl who didn't had any name, who didn't belonged, here was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to be reunited--found family and united with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> gave her, everyone an incredible hope, an incredible future; and because of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> there never will be another Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  We can just stop and change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">We're almost done. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I just want to ask about the art. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">TAPE #3
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Now. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Alice, how long roughly were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  I was about two...two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Actually, what I wanted to do very much, when I met my wonderful husband--wonderful, wonderful man--who understood totally what was, and who encouraged me and gave me really the freedom to live again. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And I told him I must share one experience with him, and that's <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ; that we have to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , that he must know what my ideal is in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">What kind of person I want to be, how I want my children should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">The tolerance, the goodness of the Swedish people--what I experienced as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And he was wonderful, and he accepted a position in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ; and he kept telling me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , "But don't be disappointed, because you were a child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">You now are a grown person. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And people are people. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They're not angels." </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But, you know, we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and I right away called this wonderful gentleman, this Mr. Haggberg's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And Vera, the secretary, answered; and she said, "You know, Mr. Haggberg is not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He lives already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">But he's exactly here for the dentist, and I phone him right now to the dentist." </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And do you know that in ten minutes, Mr. Haggberg was in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we were, embracing us and meeting my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And so I knew that I am back with this wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">It was not a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">It was a reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And we will...we were instrumental helping the settlement of the refugees who came like I came into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , who remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And...and uh my husband opened <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> in ...1n small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> ; and it was hard work because we were newly-wed, and he would travel every day to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I would open <span class="BUILDING">Sunday schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And...but then our...the miracle happened that I had a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And can you imagine, where I got life several years before, I gave life now to this wonderful little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I mean, there was nobody like this...first-born, and in this total ...1n this beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , where the people are really angels. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And...and when Ronnie was three years old, we decided that...or we go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or we'll come for a year to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And we decided to come for a year to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">We had enough money just to stay a year, for Moshe to make his doctorate here. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And ...and for me to...for us just to see <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And we were so enchanted by what American Jewry did, and how...my husband said, "This is like the other wing of the eagle. </span><span class="sentence" id="820"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> together balance the Jewish world." </span><span class="sentence" id="821">The Jewish world that was so terribly, terribly maimed...the European Jewry; now the American Jewry and the Israeli Jewry together balance it...and restore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And we were more and more...became involved in the creativity part of the Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And Rabbi [Wolf] Kellman, blessed memory, insisted that Moshe should get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> as soon as we learned the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He said to me, "You know, there are only ten people here in my rabbinat who 1s...who are like your husband, and we need him here." </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And so this is how we entered this wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And since that time, I don't think we've stopped with our creative lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We have now two sons, who are rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I have a little girl, Rina. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And Rina for me...when Rina was born, Ronnie was ten year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And Ronnie said, "My mother has a sister," accidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Instead of saying, "My mother has a daughter," Ronnie said, "My mother has a sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And Rina came to me as a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">As a gift that was very difficult, because Rina is special. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Rina is Downs Syndrome child. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I thought that I cannot bear that pain; but Rina today 1s twenty-seven year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">She's so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Her soul is like anybody's soul--pure, clean and gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Rina is a gift from God. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And in a way, she is Edith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  Alice, what do you carry with you the most, do you think, from the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  That I didn't found Edith. (</span><span class="sentence" id="842">Sigh; pause) Not my personal suffering, and not my own...what.... And no hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But the spirit of those who didn't survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I always ask what incredible people we are...instead of cursing God and man, we create a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We give birth to children, and we raise them Jewish and we affirm them to life, to faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">What incredible people we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And how incredible our teachings are. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And I became an artist, and my art is about this period of life; because 1n the '70's I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and I saw that nobody mourned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Nobody missed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Nobody cared that we disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And the pain of that realization. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">That there was no monument in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">That the children disappeared in...in the daylight in a June day, and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Nobody remembered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I felt that my art has to be dedicated to those who did not come...came back. (</span><span class="sentence" id="856">Sniffling) And to an incredible man, Raoul Wallenburg, who saved a hundred thousand Jews--including my father--and shows to all of us what one man can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">From one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , look at this incredible devastation that Hitler brought to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Forty years later, and we still have the scars, the pains; and we are maimed forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And on the other hand, a Raoul Wallenburg--a man who is not Jewish, who is a Swede, who was an aristocrat, who didn't have to be in Hungary-- but he was a man, a total human being; developed his soul, not only his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And he knew how to stand up; and he stood up, just with a piece of paper, with a certificate...with a...with a absolutely not valid certificate, against the German machinery of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Against the evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And look what a message for the next generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Everybody can choose what they want to do in life with themselves, go right or go left. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And the Torah says, "Choose life." </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But the important thing is what life you're choosing. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Not only the self-gratification, not only the self. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But choose life. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Look at the life of the others, and help and stand up where...where unrighteousness and evil is done. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And stand up and be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We all have the ability, just like Raoul Wallenburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">This tape is for my grandchildren; but for all the grandchildren, for all the children whom I will not meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">If they're looking for heroes, they have to look into their souls and found the hero in themselves.</span></p>
