<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  If I could just ask you, you were saying as you were making your way to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war, I’m wondering if you could describe a little more, do you remember how, you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And how you would feel <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And would you have encounters with these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes, it was a very chilling experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were mostly desolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And there weren’t too many people walking around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because the Germans had just passed through. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We would come to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where maybe there was a square. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And on the square people would congregate. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And somehow, we always felt who it was Jewish or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">These people were completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I mean living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and knowing the Polish people, we knew how the Polish people behave and how they look. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">These Jewish people were like they are coming out from hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Their heads were down. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They were sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">They still had the frightened look in their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They were probably hiding someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Whether in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> or being hidden in some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They did not appear like the other people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we kind of looked the same way I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And commonly we just like you know like dog to dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had something that pulled us to each other and we started to talk and it’s the word to approach somebody was Am Who. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Am Who means in Hebrew Am is Nation and Who meant are you from the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And somehow we saw these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We saw quite a few of those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there was the sadness of having lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So that was more or less what happened but we didn’t stay on. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We just kept on going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  So you didn’t talk to them very
ANSWER:  Well we just briefly talked to them but everybody was just engaged in searching and doing his thing and we couldn’t wait to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had a knapsack and we were tired from walking and not sleeping and, and you know took us maybe ten days or two weeks to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> there was a Jewish organization and they were registering all the people that were coming back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">A lot of it was a great influx of people from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> allowed these people to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And there were some people coming out from, very few from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The majority from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and also some that were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Like the able bodied, not Jewish looking, females mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Because males could always be checked out for being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Because of circumcision. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So we met quite a few people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewish committee, we found that nobody that from our families had been registered so we kind of already thought that there’s nobody there from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But nevertheless we tried to establish ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> because we just didn’t’ know what to do with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And people were constantly coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was like every day when we went out to a <span class="DLF">town square</span> you could see a few people coming here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And of course being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , maybe somebody that you knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So some friends and acquaintances came. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And some were in more need than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Some were fighting with, on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and were wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Also none of us had anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my husband met some family, he met sometimes, he met an uncle that our experience with him was not very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And he tried to help us at the beginning but then he was very busy with his own life, personal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I don’t want to get into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So actually we were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we just couldn’t find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My husband wanted to go back to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He was third year <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and he just didn’t know where and how. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And the climate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> was very unpleasant because the Poles were not happy that some Jews survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they were making some very nasty remarks. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I was confronted with this tremendous Polish anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Mostly because I did not appear to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And if people met me on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , or on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> they would make these remarks to me that oh they are coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Hitler didn’t kill them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And in such a climate I just absolutely could not live even a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  What would you do when you would hear remarks like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Would you
ANSWER:  Well let me tell you about a very particular encounter because where we lived, we lived always where the Aryans lived, we did, never lived in so called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Cause my mother was a practicing dentist and we had a lot of Gentile patients and where we lived was almost a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gentile neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived was a lady that was running the laundry service. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And she had like a <span class="BUILDING">cleaning store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And right after the, right during the war, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was finished and we ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my mother left a lot of things with that lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Silver candelabras, all kinds of art objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Things that were of value. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Thinking that if anybody survives and needs the money to sustain themselves during the war, we would just go to her and get this stuff and be able to sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I knew all about it because my mother told me where these things were. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I knew that I have these things with that lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I tried to get some things together and we knew that we have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> 1s a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and nobody knows us. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I have to buy some false papers and we have to just go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So I went to her like in an afternoon and this woman knew me since practically I was 4 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And when she came in she says oh my god where are your parents and she started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Where is your brother and she was crying and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then I said to her, can I get the things that my mother left with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And she said oh it’s all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">If you come back at 2:00 PI have everything ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Well needless to say I came back at 2:00 and the Gestapo was there waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Her cousin was working for the Gestapo, he was a secret agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I had a terrible, I don’t want to get into it now but I had a terrible encounter with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And practically cost my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Somehow, I got out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And after the war I just couldn’t forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , there was you know a committee of crimes and, you could really talk about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Especially show people that were hostile in doing these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I went to, over there to first of all I showed my face to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And when she saw me that I survived, I knew this woman practically almost dropped in what she saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Can you still remember it today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yes, I can remember it and I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My memory is still good. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I can remember what she looked like and she just was very, very upset to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I just said hello to her and I said and I remember what you did to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I left and then I went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was run by Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But don’t’ forget that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was communist at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">and it was Burjon Bespeki Vespechaestva and I talked to people there and I asked them what I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">To this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Because she practically not only cost my life, but I was taking care of my little brother and my husband and they were completely helpless without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And if something would happen to them I mean they could have never survived without, I was their outside contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And they told me that there’s nothing they can do because I have to have witnesses and if I don’t have any witnesses I should just forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I was very upset and then we stayed for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And the situation was just very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Let me just ask you, what did you want to have happen at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Oh I wanted her either arrested or to have some repercussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I knew for what she was doing to me, she was probably doing to others and she could have been even doing it to the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But nothing did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And we just tried to get our life together. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We couldn’t so because there was no money and I could not be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> for too long because every stone and every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> reminded me of my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And reminded me of my parents and I just couldn’t take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That was in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I was 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we decided that we were going to try to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> because there was no use of waiting for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They could find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And my husband found out that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> that he attended before, he had no papers, everything was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">That the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ’s moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> was taken by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> that they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blievitz</span> which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> took over ok in the exchange for the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">A little bit to the west was given to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So we decided that we going to go, try to go there and see if he can get into the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> cause that was the most important thing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blievitz</span> and as it turned out we spent there about 3 or 4 months and it turns out that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> is not coming there, but they are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> which was a much bigger <span class="BUILDING">university</span> that they took over from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that <span class="BUILDING">university</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> with all the professors were coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Now it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now it’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It used to be German. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So after living for about 3 or 4 months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blievitz</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And in October of that year, my husband met with some professors that knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And he was able to get in for 3 year <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We considered ourselves very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I tried to get a job and somehow sustain ourselves you know in order for him to continue but we knew it’s not going to be on a long time basis, because we did not want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That was just an absolute N O. We felt that we just cannot live in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that hurt us so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And the memories are too painful and if you want to start a new life, it has to be someplace else, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  There you are right after the war in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , as you say where all these horrible things that happened and you say there were memories everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I’m wondering it’s just so hard today to imagine being in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I wonder if you could describe a little more what your day to day emotions were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Would you say today that you were depressed or would you cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Would you turn a corner and see a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I’m just trying to figure out what that would feel like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Well when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> it was indescribable how painful and hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Because to give you an example to add insult to injury was the fact that the Poles were so hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Would we have been embraced by the people that we knew and that we grew up with and with people that also suffered, but not to that extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It would have been maybe half way bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But the hostility was just so tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My best girlfriend was pregnant 9 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">She came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Her husband was killed on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">That now this is this woman giving birth to a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The first child born after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">In a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the nurses just damned this baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">God damn, Hitler didn’t kill them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We have to have a Jewish child now . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It can’t be helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean this was just unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> I knew that we had to be strong to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And the emphasis was mostly on survival and how and what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">All the survivors were trying to just find a way, whether to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or emigrate or go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Illegally but do something for yourself because here you are already surviving the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And you got nothing but your life, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And now it’s up to you to know which direction to take and which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It’s like you’re on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and you want to save yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was a matter of not saving your life, as much as knowing what to do with yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And because we had this one direction that my husband wanted to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He didn’t want to go into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The easiest thing to do was to smuggle and to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Everything was still chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So I just knew that we had to, that looking past is one thing and being hurt in it is another. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But it’s not going to help emotionally because you see we were very young and when you’re young you’re strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You take life in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I just knew that we had to go on, make some right decisions and push forward and we were among people who had the same goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Fortunately we were surrounded by students and academic people who had the same goals and wanted the same thing out of life, rather than making money and maybe amassing some fortunes by some illegal dealings and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  It sounds like what you’re saying 1s the survival that the drive for survival you developed during the war, it never let up. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You just stayed in that condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The power of survival even for people that were in concentration camps which I never was and even people that saw their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain think in the human nature that really wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And you know and I cannot talk about it to other people, but this is what we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">| And I knew that I have to help my husband and I gotajob. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We gota little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratswath</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and he went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And we knew it’s only temporary but we knew that he has to wait a year just to get his papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Cause once he gets all his papers that he finished 3 years <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , maybe wherever we go, to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he’s got at least something to show. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And maybe he’! </span><span class="sentence" id="186">be able to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So that’s exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We lived there almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , third year, got all the papers and then we decided out. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">This is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We really have to sever all our, our relationships with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and just erase it from our lives and just go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And we had no gall. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We didn’t know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was very hard at the time, you know to make any, any sense was, with your plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But then we joined a Zionist group which was a student group. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was about 25 Jewish students, Zionist oriented and we thought that maybe if we go with a group it would be easier for us to be recognized wherever we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Rather than one individual person.</span><span class="sentence" id="199">So with a knapsack, the BreiHa was helping Israelis, were helping the Jews out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In a semi-legal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Meaning that if you went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> there maybe would be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> there waiting for you and then taking you maybe to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or someplace, but it was all kind of semi-legal without any guarantees and with these papers in his hand, on with a knapsack and with very little money we decided to try and we went with this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there was maybe about 25 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We got into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they took us, this BreiHa, they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a big concentration of refugees and the American Joint has been sponsoring a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And it was like a transit place, is for people that were coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and coming out of concentration camps, trying to go other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And there was an awful lot of people at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by all four, but the Americans had a great hand in deciding what to do at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we were aided already by the Joint Distribution Committee to and they, they really encouraged us not to go any further because they said that they would like to help the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And they might have a way for the Austrians to allow these peoples to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Under pressure, without tuition because as a, as a part of a reparation of what happened to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And that really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The Americans helped us to get into the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , get a very small stipend from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Not to pay tuition at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We had to, of course, qualify. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There was all kinds of Latin examinations and everything to go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And have some papers to show. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But it was an opportunity for my husband to continue and he fell for it right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">That was 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">October. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They helped us with some <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Of course it was very crowded and we had to share <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But most of the people were single. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was only another married couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And us. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And we were helping each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">You know and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time also had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So you got a little bit of this and a little bit of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You put it all in one pot and we had some soup at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We felt kind of good about it because we knew that we had a goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We knew that we’re doing something for our future. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And it wasn’t very unpleasant because the Jewish student at that time, we came with a small group. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But there were 400 Jewish students at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we were all supported by the Americans through the Austrians that had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And we were a great group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we spent 4 years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It was kind of very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Even though we didn’t have any money, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> 1s a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Even so we felt that we never forgot that they were connected with Hitler and they were anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But of course at that time they didn’t’ show it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  So that was different than in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Different and you know our hostility primarily was to the Poles, who personally, personally were helping with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Here at least we were in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where they allowed us to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We had the freedom of moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I could not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They were very strict about people that are not Austrians, very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So illegally somebody employed me for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And we just had a gay student life. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We were young and we didn’t need much and we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span> and stand you know on top there and go to a concert and never sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You know but it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that offered a lot to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And it was a real bohemian student life that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We had a wonderful group of Jewish people and a lot of feedback you know from the Jews and from the Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that was the four years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Is this, were you able to in comparison to the way you felt for years up to this point, were you able at all to relax a bit
ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There were other tensions. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean first of all you didn’t’ know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I, I myself went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> because there was the easier things for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">You know and I had to, we had a lot of studying to do in the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The language was foreign to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So it was impossible to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">You don’t know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was very, very hard at the beginning and my husband was under a lot of pressure in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> because they didn’t like foreigners you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> was gigantic and tremendous and, and they would rather not pass Jewish students and especially foreigners so we had two strikes against us you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But somehow we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My husband was under tremendous pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I really didn’t care because it wasn’t that important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was biding my time, but for him it was very important and he was under tremendous pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Of course a lot of professors were Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And the level at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was very, very high at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And he had a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I mean he had four years of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> because he really had to succeed and get that diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">In the meantime, people were trying to see where they can go and what they can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">A lot of our students did not finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Some went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And some just stayed out and you know tried to finish, because somehow I made contact with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Distant family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And through pure coincidence, somebody met somebody on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were talking about people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And somebody mentioned cousins and to make the story short, I found out that there’s a distant relative living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , quite well to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And having a tremendous family in Europe, being from Europe himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And that if I made contact with him that he would probably be able to help us, mostly in, in securing a affidavit to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So while my husband was doing all that, I made contact with these people and I told them what who I was and I told them that we are here and my husband is finishing <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And upon the direction of my uncle I call him uncle, we were advised not to do anything before he gets his diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Because it will be impossible to continue in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He has to finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We just have to stay as long as it takes for him to finish <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And that was our primary goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">As I said, life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was not unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We really had, we managed to have a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We wanted to have a little fun because we were in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> for so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And our youth was practically nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">War broke out, I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You know so we really wanted to do a little bit living and, and see what’s going on in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And that wasn’t impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We had our ways to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And finally we waited until he finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and we waited to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because uncle said that he will a, give us an affidavit to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  There’s one thing I’d like to ask you about which is you’re with all these other students and people who have survived you living in that kind of big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> or whatever you want to call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  It was an old <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The Germans that they gave us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  ’'m wondering if there was a lot of discussion and debate among you all about where to go, whether to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , whether to go to somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  It, it differs a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Some of my friends went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> because they had uncles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and they wanted to be with their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Family was a big factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Whenever somebody had a family they were really flocking to be with their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We didn’t’ have anybody anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">A lot of people were Zionists and they really wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not very simple because it was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and you had to really go on an illegal, on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and (no sound) A lot of people were Zionists and they really wanted to go <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not very simple because it was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and you had to really go on an illegal on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and illegally but a lot of people did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Some of our students, I must tell you are still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and never left. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They intermarried and for some reason or other, they were their studies were rather confining to the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">For instance they had all kinds of social studies and other things where it would be very hard to apply it in a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We were fortunate because medicine is almost similar or the same all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So it was all different. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The majority of, of our students went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Whoever had a chance not to go, opted probably to go someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Some went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> if they found sponsors. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">If they had maybe some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Now my husband knew that when he will go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> he will have to repeat the whole thing and take internships and he was so worn out from this German and he really was in very bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I mean he was very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">He was physically and mentally absolutely exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And he said to me that he doesn’t see how he can go to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where he will have to do it all, all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">With the language and everything and to get a license to practice, 1t was, would be very hard for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">On the other hand, I myself even so I had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I knew that if I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But I myself was very worn out from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I couldn’t’ take the burden of being a pioneer again and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was at the pioneering stage at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">and maybe it was selfish on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But don’t’ forget that I was 13 when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I was the one that had to earn the living. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I had the one that had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and sell under pressure of being recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I was the one that had to deal with <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and Gestapoes and food and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I had a burden of not only to take care of myself but I had a brother who was nine year, nine years younger than I was and I had him for almost a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And a husband that couldn’t’ show his face on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So I was under, I had a tremendous burden, burden surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I just couldn’t’ see myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The thought of, of being shot or the thought of, of having the Arabs there doing all the things that they were doing at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">There were still wars there. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You know there was the 46 war and there was the 48 independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then there was another war. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The thought of being in another war or, or hearing the shooting again. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It, to me, it was just unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I knew that I cannot doit. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">AndI told my husband I would like just to come to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to live a little bit in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I just want peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">If later on he wants to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , if things straighten up, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But I have to have a rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I just cannot do it anymore and he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He said ok let’s try. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We’ll see how it works out. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We will you know we were in agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was
QUESTION:  He wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  He wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because the thought of being able to practice and be a doctor right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="360"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , just as long as you had a diploma, you didn’t have to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They took to the, to the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You know private medicine was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I mean they never had private medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was all socialized medicine at that time.</span><span class="sentence" id="365">But you could get a job and you would have to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And the thought of him to study another language and starting all over again it wasn’t possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But he gave in to, he knew that I just couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He would have a basket case. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">As long as I was holding up it was ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But I just couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I said, I had such a burden and I needed, I needed some <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So he decided that we’ll come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And of course I had the full support of my family who really wanted us to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And my uncle sent affidavits and papers and we waited until my husband finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we couldn’t wait because ten days later we were already trying to get on our DP status and just take off and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> there was still a lot of kids that didn’t finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Don’t’ forget he was one of the older students. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So he there were kids that stayed and it took them longer to finish or even <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They were just starting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">He came in already was three years behind him so it was much easier for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we took off for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  How did you come over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Well that was another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">You see we were DPs, displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And displaced persons were being shipped to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Ours was general Bletchford. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And general Bletchford was supposed to be a transporter for 400 soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We were 1200 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And we were going in the middle of November and we had to be taken first from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And there we waited, 3,4,5,6 weeks in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were bringing people over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And there were maybe three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> but at that time there must have been 6, 7000 people waiting there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And of course we had to undergo a tremendous medical, physical examination because anything with a spot on your lung, right away you were ejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It wasn’t like today that people coming with TB, AIDS and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It was unbelievable what kind of medical scrutiny we had to undergo. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">In order to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We waited about three or four weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremer</span> and then finally we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The voyage was so bad that we almost didn’t make it because the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was old and we had, we were 1200 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">The food was absolutely not, not even to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And look it was for free, so I mean there was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We just had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And we went to <span class="REGION">Halifax Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We had 400 people for <span class="REGION">Halifax Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So first we went, it took us about 12 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">First we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Got off these people, that, that were for <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and they all had papers and sponsors. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And we had ten dollars but we had a whole big crate of medical books that my husband couldn’t’ part with. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But became obsolete in a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He had two microscopes that he wouldn’t part with. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And very little personal belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I have to mention that my uncle was very generous and he tried to help us during the our stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He was very impressed with the fact that my husband wants to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He felt it personally that he wants to help him, although he never met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">He was, my husband was the only one from the whole family that he was helping and trying to bring over here that showed any interest in, in his, in being a professional man. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And he tried to help us as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">He used to send us money through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">My aunt used to send clothes and warm coats for me or whatever they could, they really did for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It wasn’t easy to send stuff over there but they were very nice and very generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So that made our stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> much nicer. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And we finally arrived at the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Well my first impression of the free world was 3:00 in the morning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , seeing a seven or eight year old boy in the middle of the winter all bundled up selling newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And trying to, to tie up the paper to a rope and throw the paper with the rope over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And then these people were, whatever people had was probably dollars because nobody was going with Austrian money. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Then the people would in turn tie the dollar to the rope and throw it back to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I never saw that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I came from a well to do <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I really haven’t encountered anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And all I knew about the free world are things are so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I mean the idea of in Europe at that time was actually that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> people are finding money on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You know and you were very gullible. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The thought of that boy at 3:00 in the morning just never left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And that was like 50 some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I said does a boy that age at 3:00 in the morning has to sell newspapers like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And he was very, very pushy. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And people were dying to have a paper even so they couldn’t read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But then we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And of course my family was waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Also we didn’t’ know each other but we had all kinds of signs, with red carnations and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And it was very cold in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was not very pretty at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It was very windy and we were just absolutely worn down. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">From this horrible, horrible trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And everybody was taken to HIAS which was the Hebrew aid organization but my uncle did not want us to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Because living circumstances were kind, kind of hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Can I ask you, do you remember or do you have any first impressions or memories of when you came into New York Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">What was that like. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">What time was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Yes, first of all it was Thanksgiving so already on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> we had turkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I didn’t know anything about Thanksgiving and just one good meal was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And they were telling us the crew on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , that they were telling us it’s Thanksgiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And that’s a holiday the Europeans don’t’ have. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I cherish this holiday til this very day and every time I have family for dinner we always talk about Thanksgiving because this is our anniversary of coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And, and unfortunately it was also Saturday or Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We couldn’t get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> but at least it wasn’t shaking any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You had to wait for the customs for Monday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There was all kinds of people with us you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There were very religious people which were coming in with crates of china for holidays and china for, for meat and china for milk and china for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And it was really funny when the customs opened up those crates and asked them and they really didn’t understand what was going on because china in Europe, especially good porcelain was very inexpensive and these people apparently had money and they tried to bring it all to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I mean I didn’t’ have this problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We had books and two microscopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But it was very funny when these people tried to explain to the customs how they had this ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Of not eating from the same dishes you know all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And then of course it was gloomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But my aunt came and took us to a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for which my uncle paid for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  I’m just curious and maybe this is just me from seeing, reading about immigrants and seeing these films. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You always have this image of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> coming in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and the Statue of Liberty appears. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Did you see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Do you remember that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You’re shaking your head.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  It was so windy that at that day when we arrived a brick fell from some big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and killed a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was just a very gloomy unfriendly day on the 27" of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And it was so mammoth to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Just so mammoth. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I’ve never. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> which 1s a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> but this was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And of course the language barrier too. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I took a few, knowing that I’m going to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I already took a few courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">At the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But that’s a differ, that’s a different English. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Maybe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> I would feel better with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And because among all these people that came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> I was the only one that knew a few words of English, I always had people with me, trying to go wherever I go because my uncle got us a <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But the meals, we were supposed to go back to the HIAS 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we had to travel by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And we had to find our way from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to <span class="DLF">425 Lafayette Street</span> which I still remember you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And there was some other people that stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and every morning and every afternoon I would have these cohorts with me and the taxi drivers were very unfriendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">When I asked them which way we can walk or can we take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , they said no if you take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> we’ll take you there, but they were very unfriendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And while we were in the <span class="BUILDING">HIAS</span> every day some American Jews tried to come in and ask us if we want to rent a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , communicating in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And also because at the HIAS there were people from all over the world, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Speaking all different kind of language. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Well we encountered that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There were Romanian Jews and Hungarian Jews and they were Latvian Jews and Polish Jews and you know Jews just don’t’ get along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Everybody has a different culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Everybody grew up in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And there was a lot of fighting between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And then all of a sudden a lot of people came with little children and the grownups had to look either for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or for a job or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The children were completely lost and they needed a nanny for those children. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So they got me to work with these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Every day I would go there in the morning and have my breakfast in this <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">My husband would go to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Park Row</span> which was the physicians committee who was trying to find internships and residencies through the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for these Jewish doctors, providing that a community would offer for about 2 years or so assistance, monetary assistance to these people because these people could not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And some of them had families. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So they had to find a community that wanted to support this given doctor while he is in training. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So my husband had to go there in the morning and I was working at the HIAS with these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And because I speak a few languages, I could communicate with these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And for that I was compensated with $25 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Well that was already very good because with the $25 a week we could go to a movie and listen to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">First of all it was a great thing to go and listen what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We also bought a radio because we were putting in <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> into a radio at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and that paid for 20 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So we figured out well it’s an American idea you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You put in a quarter and the radio plays for 20 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We, we it took us time to figure it out but we wanted to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They told us just to listen to the spoken language. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So finally we decided to buy a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We bought a radio for $25 and we listened to our own radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So we, we made an investment but we didn’t have to put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And we just waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It was a waiting game at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Going to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , coming back, getting a little bit acquainted with the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And of course my aunt and uncle always had us over for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I mean it was Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They lived at the Riverside drive in a magnificent <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They were very wealthy people but very generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They came here during the war, but they already had a lot of businesses and money in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and they had a tremendous, tremendous family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and they were trying to help everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And going there was like a, it was like a fairy tale world, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Because they had a magnificent <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> overlooking the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and they were traveling a lot abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He had businesses in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">My aunt being a very tiny little aesthetic lady with servants and a chauffeur and, and beautiful things at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Well to me it was really like, like a fairy, <span class="REGION">fairy land</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And we were going there for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And in a very subtle way she would put 20 or 30 dollars in the pocket of my coat because she wouldn’t want to humiliate me to give me the money you know, which was probably different from all the other people that came over here and maybe experienced family relations here you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I just had very good, very good feeling and a very good relationship with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">She always asked me if I need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I said no we really don’t need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We just have to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We have enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We just have to wait until something happens that my husband gets dispersed to someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And of course we were in a different group of people because other people didn’t’ know what to do with themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We had it a goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We knew he has to get an internship and of course we wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Because we didn’t know there was a <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We just knew that there 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And we had a few cousins and my aunt and uncle and we wanted to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  So were you getting used to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It wasn’t as intimidating then or it still was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  It was In, we were there six weeks and it was intimidating. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was, but you know you get a little better feeling of what’s going on and we were told that we cannot stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Because all everybody, all the doctors wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And there isn’t enough <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And we were told that we should maybe consider going to a small community which is much nicer, where the people are nicer. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Where you can really you don’t feel so lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It’s more like a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Well the committees are there, the Jewish committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Everybody was trying to help the refugees and the Jews had come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Everybody felt a little bit guilty you know that that they were there and they survived and they weren’t punished like we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So after six weeks they found a very friendly little community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester New York</span> , who was willing to accept a Jewish doctor and help him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And they found a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that would take him in as a, as an intern. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Cause he needed two years of internship. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And one day we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We got in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We said goodbye to my aunt and uncle and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Well the first thing was that we couldn’t’ get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there was that much snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="564"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had, didn’t have any snow and we were just in shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We didn’t’ have any boots or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So that was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We had to go out and buy a pair of boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And the committee was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They waited for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And they already had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> rented from a family that came in, in 1939 and it was a German family. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And they were two working people. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They had an old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they wanted to sublet a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They needed the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Then they looked for a Jewish fellow, a Jewish couple or somebody that would live with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  These people were Jewish or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Yes, these people were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The committee, the Jewish committee tried to place us in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And when we went to live with these people, 1t was a marvelous relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They had one daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And to me it was like having another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they were extremely friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Not very sophisticated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He was completely uprooted. § </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He had to work as a presser, pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And she was sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">A lot of Jewish people were doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But intelligent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They sent their daughter to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and we just had a very nice two years with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Felix had to go into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And we were not sorry that we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It was really nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Spring came and it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And very green and completely different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European cities</span> , with the big old <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , small <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597"><span class="DLF">Back yards</span> , little <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and it was very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I planned to get myself a job and they said they’re going to try to place me someplace because they didn’t want to completely support us. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">At that time I think we were getting 16 dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I mean I don’t’ really remember exactly but we were living with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And they were very dear to us until they day they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They tried of find me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Felix had a very hard time at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">First of all he was an (extra?) </span><span class="sentence" id="605">between April and July he was an (extern?). </span><span class="sentence" id="606">July the internship starts. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">It was a small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> but a <span class="BUILDING">teaching hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There were 27 interns and residents there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And they found a lady who was German descent who was a spinster who was quite well to do and wanted to help and she taught him English. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">She would actually have him over in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And she would sit with him for an hour or two speaking German to him and teaching him English. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Very lovely lady.</span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they tried to get me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And they found me a job at <span class="BUILDING">Woolworth’s</span> where I was selling baked goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And that was a six days a week job. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I think I was making 20 some dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">and it wasn’t a matter of my preference because they were the ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was you know what, maybe it’s a little similar of, to the situation today that people are on welfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was completely depending on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I couldn’t say gee I don’t’ want that job because I had 3 years of <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I really don’t’ like to stand there and sell fried cakes and doughnuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But these people were helping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That was temporary. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They were, I couldn’t’ tell them I don’t want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It wouldn’t’ be fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So I had to take the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So I took the job and it was very difficult at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Because I didn’t know a fried cake from a doughnut. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I mean that was strange to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I was standing at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> surrounded by younger girls who practically never went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And they all knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I mean they knew people came in and they wanted 3 of this and 6 of this and 5 of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And somehow I didn’t’ have to write down on the box and figure out how much they owe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Because we were putting the string on and they were adding 18 and 14 and 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I somehow did it without having to write it down, because I added it up in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And after six months the sup, no, after that was maybe after 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The Supervisor came up to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">She said I see that you’re quite smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Maybe we’ll give you a little better job. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Maybe this is not the right job for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And I started to speak a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And they said you know what, we’re going to put you in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stock room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You’re going to make up orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The orders come from downstairs and they you’re going to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">stock room</span> and you’re going to be in <span class="INT_SPACE">stock room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And you’re going to put together these orders for each <span class="BUILDING">station</span> downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And I was very grateful because I could sit, I didn’t’ have to stand six days a week, 48 hours that was kind of hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I started to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stock room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">But I still was not very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And after six months, I was granted one week’s vacation paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And as soon as I got my weeks’ vacation I went to the New York state employment agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I said you know what, I don’t’ speak English very well but I have, first of all I had two years of medical school cause I went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I said I have two years of <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I know medical terminology and my English is not that great but can you get me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So they offered me right away two jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">One was telephone answering, I mean telephone company. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Answering with the numbers and the other one is was at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I kind of liked that because I was with a husband that was studying medicine forever and ever and ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I had to do with him the you know the lessons and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And listen to everything so I never came back to <span class="BUILDING">Woolworth’s</span> ’ I just took the job at the Blue Cross Blue Shield. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And it was entirely different feeling on the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I was making $35 a week and after 3 months they would review me. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I was approving medical claims because I knew the terminology and there was restrictions on certain diagnoses. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And there was_ certain preexisting conditions and other factors you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I liked my job very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I had a phone and I worked with very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">In a very nice <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And at that time we already moved out from the people there because we wanted to have our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I was making already a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I decided we’re going to take our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because at that time $55 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> with a drop leaf table and a tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But it was our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And my husband couldn’t’ wait to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">It was very hard to be without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because you know it’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and you have to get in to the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And weekends we couldn’t move any <span class="NPIP">place</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We were sitting in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So he had these microscopes and he decided he says you know what I’m going to sell the microscope and buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He sold the microscope and he bought a little old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Plymouth</span> , a 47 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Plymouth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I think it was 5 or 600 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And he knew how to drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  How did he know how to drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Well I think he drove in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blievitz</span> he already drove. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I mean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> was his thing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So we already had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I was making enough to cover and whenever I didn’t have enough, they would pay me the difference of what I needed for very basic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he started his, his internship and he was quite happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They were very nice to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">teaching hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He was very happy and I was working and then on s, because I only worked five days a week, on Saturday and Sunday I sold clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">At the <span class="BUILDING">Lerner Shop</span> and I made another $12 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And you know it kind of was beginning to work out for us a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Um. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I like to work for the Blue Cross and he had another year I think on that internship. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">In the meantime he tried to apply to get a license at <span class="REGION">New York State</span> but it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So the second year of his internship I got pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And we were already married then ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And we had no money and we had nothing but I kind of said to myself you know enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was already 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We have to just eventually start a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We didn’t’ want a family in Europe because there was no milk, there was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Everybody was starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We knew we had to go across to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We didn’t know what we’re going to come into. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">But as rough as it is you know children grow up anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">You don’t’ have to have everything for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So we decided we’re going to have this baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And my little lady that I lived with was absolutely like a mother to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I had a very hard time at the beginning and she was there with a pot of soup every single night for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And she really took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She was very, very sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">At that time she didn’t work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">She’s got a big part in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So she kind of took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I still worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I worked up until 7 or 8 months pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">They were very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">If I wasn’t feeling well they gave me a day off. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I must say that they had a lot of respect for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And I had my son and at that time I stopped working because there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Mothers didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Even if you had money or you didn’t have money, you didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">My husband was making a total of $15 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I don’t’ know if he told you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But at that time internships did not pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And out of the $15 a month, he had to give them $5 for laundry and the other ten he smoked away day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So there was practically nothing on his side that he could give me. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and a tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> (end file 1) (file 2 — RG-50.549.01.0019.02.02 — duration: 01:01:47) LUCINE HORN: and the other ten he smoked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So there was practically nothing on his side that he could give me. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We had the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And we had a baby and as tiny as the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, the baby was there you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I mean there was just no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And we were quite happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We got a little cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And we waited for him to finish the internship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  What did you name your child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  My, my son is named after my brother that I lost, the brother that was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">His name was Gerald, David. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And my husband’s uncle lost a little boy by the name of Jerry so my son is Gerald David which he hates until this very day but he has to forgive me, I can’t help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So
QUESTION:  One other thing I’m curious about. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">There you’re in a circumstance and you know a lot of people have been in the circumstance where you’re you know you are still fairly young and you’re just getting started. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">You don’t have the biggest <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , you don’t’ have much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">You have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">You had all that going. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But I’m also curious again about what it was like, how it felt to you, what went through your mind and heart given what you had come out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Given the fact that you were both survivors of the holocaust and now here you are and you’re bringing this new life into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I’m curious about
ANSWER:  We felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We felt
QUESTION:  Did you think of it in that way at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Yes we felt that we’re here to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">We want to raise a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Sooner or later my husband is going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It’s going to be rough at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It wasn’t like we thought we were doomed for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I always had this future ahead of me that he is going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And we were used to do with very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">That’s how I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I grew up knowing how to cook from nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I knew to make a soup from garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">That’s how I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We didn’t have anything during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And we had to sustain ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">When there was a piece of old bread, we didn’t throw it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You soaked it in milk and you made like this and you put in a little sugar and you baked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">That’s how I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So I guess we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  You make a cake out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Yes, we were finally happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We thought we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And we liked everything about the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">We liked the way the people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We liked the way the Jewish community everywhere embraced us. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">There wasn’t a holiday in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester New York</span> that we weren’t invited to <span class="BUILDING">doctors’ homes</span> for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Saturday nights they invited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">At the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they had dinners with daddies at the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And the greatest thing, we lived not far away, took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and the baby and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> it was the biggest thing to had dinner with daddy because we never saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I didn’t’ have to have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machines</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dryers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I lived one flight up walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I had to take the baby every morning with a bag of diapers, soiled diapers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Walk about 4 or 5 blocks to the <span class="BUILDING">laundromat</span> , put in a quarter to wash the diapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But I could not spend another quarter to dry them because I could hang it <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So the baby was sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">The diapers were being washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I put another bag of laundry on the buggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , took him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , without <span class="DLF">lines</span> hang the diapers out. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And that’s the way we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And we were very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I knew it is not forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And I knew that it has to be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">There’s just no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But we arrived to freedom, we arrived with people that are being good to us, that are being very encouraging to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I did not have very much to do with my uncle at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Because uncle constantly asked if he can help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And my husband constantly said I don’t need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">We don’t need more clothes right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We don’t’ need fancy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">We don’t’ need a fancy <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I’m going to arrive and I’m going to have it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">You know I’d occasionally they’d send a, an outfit for the baby or something like that but we were proud and we felt we can make it on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">There was no necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They did enough for us and we appreciated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  I’m must curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Leaving aside the material side of this and how all you had to do to be inventive to take care of yourself and your child in a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">In another sense a few years after the war, so many millions of people killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">You and your husband both lost almost all of your families. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And now you have brought this new being into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">What I’m curious about and maybe this isn’t the way you looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I’m just curious whether you had any feelings or emotions or thoughts of like you know we are helping to in having this child you were bringing something back or you were helping to restore things or you know what I’m saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I don’t’ know. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I wasn’t there but I’m curious wither you had any sense of
ANSWER:  Well to tell you the truth we were too busy struggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">There was no time for to philosophize. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">To give you an example of how my husband worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">There were three day shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He would start in the morning at 6:00 on Monday and he wouldn’t be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> til Wednesday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He would work all Monday, Monday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">All Tuesday, Tuesday night and Wednesday he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at 5. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">His feet were swollen from running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I had to put his feet and soak it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He would have his dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He would hug the baby and go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And Thursday morning we would try the same sequence of three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">There was very little togetherness. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There was very little feedback. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We had no time to dwell upon anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">We even had no time to communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">When I was pregnant and very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I had to be there alone because he was not there for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Because he couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So on top of having financial hard times, we had a very tough life. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">He had to work 36 hours in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I had to be the one to take care of my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">There was just on other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">There was no baby sitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">There was no money for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And of course, not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I had to do everything, all my shopping and grocery shopping and everything on that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and walk to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and do it back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I had nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I had nice neighbors but they weren’t really interested to do many things for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So it was hard but we knew that we are in a land of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">We appreciate being here. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Every minute of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We didn’t dwell upon going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Some immigrants said oh you know what in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they didn’t do it like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">They did it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">For us it was everything that we found here was a plus and a positive feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We did not think of ever going back because maybe things were different over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">there was no going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">there was only a <span class="DLF">black wall</span> from what happened there and everything here was good and rosy. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">We took the little blanket on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We went to a <span class="DLF">Delaware park</span> and we put the blanket on the, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and the baby was laying then and my husband took a camera and took pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That was our happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And we wanted to dwell on the happiness and not go back to the black years because otherwise we just mentally could never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I wanted to be a sound, psych, I mean a sound mother for my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I wanted to give him some sense of values. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I didn’t want them to have a frustrated mother who was thinking about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">What happened, happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">It was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It took my heart out. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But here I am a young mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I’m 25 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I have to start my life and do the best out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I cannot psychologically allow myself to do that because I have now a husband that’s struggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I have a, I have a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I want a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I want these positive things, even for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">We had a group of people there that we used to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Mother, young mothers that we were all in the same predicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We were helping each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">One had to go to the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">The other one was babysitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">You know, out of necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">We always found nice people around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I never felt that moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was such a struggle because there was always nice people around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Whether it was from the Jewish committee or was from the doctor’s or was from the resident. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">When my son was born at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my husband was interning ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">We had zero money. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">The girls in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> who were all single were so thrilled that I was pregnant that they didn’t know what to do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They wanted to buy me everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I said look it’s an old custom in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">You don’t buy anything, no <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I don’t want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I just don’t’ believe in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So they took money together and as soon as the baby was born, they bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They bought me a bassinette. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They bought whatever I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">When that baby was born, my husband got a little nurse from, from the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> to come with me for a week and teach me what to do with the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">There was no babies in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I never picked up a baby in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">That little girl would not charge me a dime. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">She would come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">She had a week off. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">She would stay with me and show me how to diaper and wash the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And she gave me so much confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And then there was another miracle that I didn’t know happens in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Everybody brought gifts to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">There was 27 residents and interns and nurses and the <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">At that time you stayed a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">They didn’t, they didn’t throw you up, out like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">The <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was full of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">There was, they brought me diapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They brought me little outfits. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">They brought me a little thing to take the baby <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . __ </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It was just a wonderful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I wasn’t forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I wasn’t by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">People really did care. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">By the time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the baby had a lot of things already. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I kind of knew that you know having a baby is happiness and, and it’s going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">It just absolute first. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">There were things like being hand me downs you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">There were people that were calling this lady that was teaching my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And asking if the Horns need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Can we send some linen to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or can we send some other things or do they need blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">These people just really because of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they wanted really to be helpful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So that’s how life was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And then my husband finished his internship and there was a big dilemma, what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Because he still couldn’t’ get a permit to stay in <span class="REGION">New York state</span> and get a license and he really wanted to get a license in <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="928">And he did want to get licensed from <span class="REGION">New York State</span> and they were making all kinds of trouble for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">At that time there was a law that whoever finished medicine after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , cannot be allowed to, to take the boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">There was all kinds of changes and all kinds of politics going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And the outcome of it was that he just couldn’t get a license to practice right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So we decided that he will maybe become a house physician for a while because we needed some money desperately. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And maybe he work on a salary to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And we didn’t want to do it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> because we found some very dear friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo New York</span> which was about only 70 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And that was a little bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> had a million and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> had maybe 350,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And I always liked to live in a little bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So my husband got a job in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">At the very not too much of a salary but at least some start. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to be with these friends that we knew from way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And unfortunately were there for 7 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We just couldn’t’ get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">He was working and making some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And we bought a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , because he always wanted a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And I never could go back to work because I had the little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And we somehow managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">We met an awful lot of dear friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And we made a life there you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">He was getting a little bit more money and then he was out working nights so for the nights he was compensated extra and being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you really don’t need that much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">You pay monthly for a telephone $5. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">You know the expenses were much less. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">We happened to find some wonderful people that we rented from and it was very inexpensive and she became like a, like a mother to me and like a nanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">She really helped me bring up my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">In the meantime I had another child, I had my daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , four years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  What year was this now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">ANSWER:  That was 56. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">He was born in 52 and that was in 56. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And we, we had an awful lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I had a lot of nice people but we were all together, one group of people from the Holocaust, trying to raise families and trying to make a life for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Some were in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Some were professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">They were just trying to establish a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And we were helping each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">We were visiting each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We had parties together. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And we just had a very nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Except my husband was still on the job and he wanted to go on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And he tried all the time to be, be able to take the license in <span class="REGION">New York state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> absolutely wouldn’t’ allow him to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">After all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And that was very frustrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Because we could never achieve anything the way he was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">His salary was $350 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I mean that wasn’t enough for a family to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And he really wanted to go out on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Even so, some doctors, he was helping some doctors occasionally and he was helping them during vacation but it was still very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And one day we were so frustrated and he kept on waiting and waiting and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And some doctors tried through senators and you know political influences and all stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And then finally we decided that we’re going to go in person to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , New York and we’re going to speak to the head person over there in the education department. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And really talk 1t over with him and ask him what we should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We went, was a very nice man at that time, an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">He sat down with us and he said Dr. Horn if I have to give you a good piece of advice, leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">There is a big <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there is a lot of states that allow foreign trained physicians to take the boards and you can make just as good a living if you go someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I know it’s hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">You don’t know anybody but you just have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">If you sit and wait here you’ll never probably be able to practice in <span class="REGION">New York State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">We didn’t’ realize that each <span class="REGION">state</span> had a different, that this is a matter of federalism you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">It’s not like uniform for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And my husband decided to take the boards in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and in <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> and in 1960 because we were three years, two years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Then we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo New York</span> from 53 practically to 59. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Well he worked as a house physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And then in 59 he came to take the boards in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">To <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> and he passed in both <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And because he really loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> he decided, we decided to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And in 1960 in February. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">My son was seven or 7 and a half; my daughter was four. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  And he had been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and decided this 1s where he wanted
ANSWER:  He only came here to take the boards, but he met some nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">He met some doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">He made some, he made some contact with people that told him they would help him to get on boards, on staff of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and maybe even give him a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">You know he wanted to work with somebody for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Because moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> was a big expense, first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And second of all he, the last six months before he took the boards he was not working because he really had to prepare for the boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">It was very hard to take the boards and he could not be working and doing these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So that completely exhausted our savings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And he the cost of living was ten times as much as in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So he really needed a job and he came out here a few times, made some contacts and got a job with another doctor, on a salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And when we moved we got a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It was on the west side in <span class="DLF">Elmwood park</span> so that we can he can be closer to the practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">QUESTION:  I was just curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He had been here even though it was briefly, when you moved to come out here, had you even been here at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  Yes, I was here twice
QUESTION:  OH ok
ANSWER:  We loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Through some acquaintances we met an awful lot of nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Before I was even living here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We were invited to a party, we were invited to dinner and it was just very nice people that we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And we were very encouraged to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> rather than to he loved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so didI. And we always like to live in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So we decided to move and in 1960 in February we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">We had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Not far away where my husband was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">He was working very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">He took all the night calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Practically ran the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the other doctor, cause the other doctor went in for a specialty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">He wanted to get a specialty so for the big practice and Felix ran the practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But he wasn’t happy being with somebody because he has to do things his own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He, he understands medicine his own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">His rapport with patients is very special and, and maybe a little different than this American doctor was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And he was always dreaming after all these years and he was already ten years later than most other doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He wanted to go into practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">By then he was already on staff of two <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and he needed a little courage because he was afraid to just put up a shingle because he still had a wife and two children to support. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And there was no talk about me going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">That never existed in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I would never leave my children with somebody else and go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I mean I just wouldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I would wait until my husband can do a better, give me a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">But I never thought of do, none of my friends every did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">At that time it wasn’t even in style. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">There was no <span class="NPIP">places</span> to leave these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">There was nobody to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">There was no immigrant people that would take care of children at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">You just had to raise your own family and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And that was a pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  I should ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We didn’t say your daughter was born what year and what did you name here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  Oh I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I just liked Linda so I named her Linda.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">QUESTION:  Ok so your son got the names of relatives and then your daughter got a name that you liked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And at that time I didn’t’ even know that it means beautiful in Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Now I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And we moved here and he was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And then I kind of encouraged him to go on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He was not happy with this other doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And I knew it’s not going to work out for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So somehow with very humble beginnings, he started out his own practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He succeeded right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">He was very well liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">His manners were just fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">People just loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">He delivered babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">He was in general practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">He was doing a lot of things with families and generations of families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And he had a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at the beginning and then we bought the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And we always kind of thought we have good thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We thought we’re going to make it and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I always stood behind him and always encouraged him to, to you know to do these things and take risks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And he was very happy in his small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at the beginning but then there was an opportunity to buy a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">He always wanted to have his own <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So we bought this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">In 19, I really don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">86 he sold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">It was 25 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">It must have been 61. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">He bought a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and he had ten <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">He had a very nice practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Very nicely furnished and I was raising my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And always wanted to finish <span class="BUILDING">college</span> because I never finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">As soon as we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> there was no sense for me to, to sit around and get a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So as soon as my children went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> full time, I went back to <span class="BUILDING">Rosewood University</span> and got my masters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And somehow never worked because my husband liked to take long vacations and I started to work for school system and was teaching German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">That was my major and it was always a conflict with vacations so I didn’t’ want to be deprived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I just didn’t’ have the freedom to do what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And he was making a good living so I really didn’t have to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And I decided to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And it wasn’t until way into his practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I always wanted to help in his practice, but he always said that it’s just not proper for a wife to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And until there was an accident in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that his nurse broke her hip and then we couldn’t’ replace the nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And I started to work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And I worked for him for nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And when he sold his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I am working now ten years for my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So I’ve always been doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And the experience and the privilege of being a full time mother and not having to really go out of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and stay with my children has so tremendously paid off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Because my children always appreciated are just so close that we just could not be a closer family there is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">My children always knew that we are just orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And that just the four of us and nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And they always knew that they have to be extra sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And that’s how wonderful with us and we felt the same thing with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Because none of us had anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">There was not a grandma, and an uncle and an aunt and a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">They had nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">They just had us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And we just had to be there for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">He, the, their father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">My husband put in tremendous late hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Seven days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And I knew that if I go or if I do things in the evening and get a sitter, these children are just not going to have a parent around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And somehow my biggest pleasure was to be with them, until this very day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">It still 1t’s the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">We just are very happy to be with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Even so they are grown now and they have their own families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">But we just have a tremendous relationship with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And this is in a way the gratification of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Because I always feel that if god took away my parents when I was 12, and all this horror was happening to me, maybe he repaid me in a certain gratification that I am still at that age here, sound mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And I can enjoy the fruit of my life and I can enjoy and be with children who have never moved away, who live in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Who are so close and that we understand each other so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And I always feel that there is maybe a certain gratification in life and this was the compensation of all the ills that I had in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  Can I ask you how much did your children learn about your particular story and your husband’s and the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">What age did that start at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  Well I would say that from the very beginning when they understood when they were maybe 12, 14 years old, when I my son was bar mitzvah, we always told them what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You know they were always looking for grandparents and grandmothers and grandfathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Their friends had it and we always had to tell them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And we were piecemeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We were telling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">For instance we used to go on vacation and I could spend two, three weeks sitting at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> sitting next to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Especially next to my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And I would tell her piecemeal stories of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">At the beginning I didn’t want to shock them because they were you know sensitive and young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  Would you wait for them to ask questions or would you bring things up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">ANSWER:  They would ask questions but I mostly was telling them my life story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I made an audiotape a little bit on my tape recorder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">They were asking questions and they wanted to know and we told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">We felt good about telling them of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">It wasn’t until they became all grown up and understood more and maybe because of their feelings towards us, they felt that they felt uncomfortable thinking how hurt we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">They began to feel very sorry for us that we had to go through this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And they were treating us very tenderly and very specially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Like they would want to spare us the thought all these bad thoughts that we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And it reached a point where my children had not seen the tapes that you just viewed from the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They each had a set in the <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> because they sent us three copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  These are the interviews you did with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">A couple years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  Yes, yes and they probably are going to see it after they, after we’re gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But they just cannot bring themselves to listen any more now to all these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And I have to tell you that they didn’t go to see Schindler’s List. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">My son saw Shoah and he’s never been the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And my daughter who cries at weddings, that’s how sensitive she is, she’s really the last person that can take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">So they do know and they do read, but as far as asking questions constantly, it hurts them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">They’re protective of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">They understand now that they are getting old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">They feel bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We were going like to lecture and we lectured a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Lately we find that it’s much harder to talk about it, because when you get older you know, your nerves are shattered and we cry more when we tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">We cry more when we think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So they want to spare us this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">They just want us to live right now as long as we have without really going into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">When I tell them that I’m going to see a movie or when I told them that I went to see Schindler’s List, I watched something on television, they get really upset because they feel it’s not for us to go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">It’s for the other people to go and watch you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They don’t want to hurt us more than we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And then this thing came up about a few months ago that maybe my brother could be alive you know so they both went absolutely crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Even the grandchildren and I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I had some very false hopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I don’t know if they’re false. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">It’s possible that he is alive but we are now in the process of trying to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">If, if this is really so and what’s going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I should just say for the record here that in your video testimony and then in the audio interview that I did with your husband the other day he told the story of how you lost your younger brother and he was tricked and the whole thing with the phony <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> and that after the war, as far as you knew that he had not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And that in the last month or so or in the last few months you’ve gotten some information that he may well have survived and you’re trying to possibly locate him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">ANSWER:  And I might just not ever find him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">QUESTION:  So that that has been covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">That story was talked about in other interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I don’t know if you want to say anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Be my guest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  I told the story in my interview about how I lost him and what happened in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">and there isn’t too much not too much has been written about this simple incident of this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that he was, that he went with. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1175">no sound) There isn’t too much not too much has been written about this simple incident of this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that he was that he went with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">But the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> was very helpful to me and they found the book at the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and they sent it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And this book covers everything that happened at that time so it’s been documented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And coincidentally yesterday I had company here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And somebody saw this book laying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And they opened up the book and they found somebody that they know who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So now I’m going to try to contact this person and see if maybe they know anything you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">But it’s been a search. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">It’s certainly gave me a little encouragement knowing that maybe even if I never find him that he might be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And if I find him or not that’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">But I’m happy to share all my thoughts with whoever is going to ever see it and read it and I must add that the enthusiasm and the happiness that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has given me and I know my husband too, it’s really been my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I mean I cherish <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I go there very often and this is really a part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">My father was a Zionist and he was founder of a youth group in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">He is written up in several books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">Zionist home</span> . _</span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I never thought of myself that I’m not going to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I really wanted to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">My father was 25 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to live there with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And he got very sick with malaria, and returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I still have relatives that tell me all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And I never thought of myself as not living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is a part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">But I have been very, very happy and I think both of us now agree that we made the right choice to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and more or less now things are very bad here too as far as safety is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">But at least things weren’t that bad and I didn’t’ have to worry about my children being shot all the time and going into the army again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And I feel that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I am very patriotic towards that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I really, it really hurts me to see how things have been recently and how this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has gone down, and down and down and it’s not really a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I came to in the 50s and 60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> gave the opportunity to all my friends who really rebuilt their lives, educated their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Started out from nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And somehow through hard work and being frugal and being thrifty and being maybe believing in God in their own way, and showing their children the values and wanting to educate their children and better themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">They have all arrived and they have all achieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">This is the group of people I am with and I must say that even American people admire that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">They really admire this group of immigrants that came in, in the 1950s and really helped build this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> up after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">We were part of it and we’re very proud of it, even though we didn’t’ fight for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">But we really feel and that’s why right now I am so disillusioned when I see all these ugly things that are happening here and the insecurities that children have to be brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Even my grandchildren I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">There is no safety for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">There is no security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">It’s just rough, it’s very rough now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> things weren’t like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">We were walking around in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">We never locked our <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I wasn’t worried when my kids went away, when they were driving, when they were going places. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Now it’s just constant, constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And I hope that maybe it will take a couple of years or so and maybe things are going to be back to where they were before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">If at all possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Because it could also be a global phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Maybe it’s just not the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1222">QUESTION:  You mentioned to me that there had been a change in your children and that now they don’t’ want to talk about the Holocaust and they want to sort of spare you any further sorrow because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I’m curious, when did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">How old were they when they changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">ANSWER:  When they became grown human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I mean you know my son was a student and when he became a father himself he understood it more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And I think with my daughter the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">It evolved by them going into our shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">My daughter feels the privilege of having a mother and a father so strongly that when she thinks that I didn’t’ have it, 1t just breaks her heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">It absolutely breaks her heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">She constantly tells me look at my little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">She’s got two grandma’s and two grandpa’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And you know I didn’t have it but I know it, she understood what it meant for me being 13 years old and not to have a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Because she herself at the age of 40 needs me every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So they became more aware of it when they became grown human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">You know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I don’t know if I’m expressing it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">But when they became parents and when they see what’s going on, it just they understood what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Regardless of the fact that people were killed in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">That’s the global tragedy that happened during the war to six million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">But on a personal level they relate to our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And that’s very painful to them and very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I don’t know if that answers your question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1244">QUESTION:  It does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">You mentioned your son saw Shoah and you said, I think the exact way you said it was he was never the same after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">What happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">ANSWER:  He just told me that he doesn’t want to see these things again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">He just can’t bear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">He cannot bear it because his own parents were so involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And his own grandparents could have been laying there in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He just cannot face up to and he just cannot take it.</span></p>
