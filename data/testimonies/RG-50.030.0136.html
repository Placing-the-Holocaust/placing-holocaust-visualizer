<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you -- sorry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Would you tell me your name, full name, again, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My full name is Simone Marguerite Lipman. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My maiden name was Weil -- W-E-I-L. Simone Weil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was actually born in a very little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was born on April 22nd, 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  And what was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't even fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which, of course, was destroyed during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I was born is in shambles, but it's still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My family moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> in -- when I was three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation for a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They're all family of Jewish butchers, but he broke out of there, ‘though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education, and he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I have a brother -- I should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the Yom Kippur War in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us were very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting movement, Les Eclaireurs Israélites de <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Les "EIF," as we called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I also got a very solid Jewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I went to Talmud Torah all through my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and was very active in things Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And particularly, as I said, in the Jewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I went into the <span class="BUILDING">lycée</span> ,” like all kids my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I got a good classical education, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">In those days, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But when I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to become a physicist. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better in -- to go into something more practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so I went into early childhood education, and I'm stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I mean, I never moved away from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So I got one year of training, and that's all. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The Israeli Scouts of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> (French). * </span><span class="sentence" id="34">French grammar or <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , funded by the State (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my parents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I went somewhere in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with her for just a short period. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Then things calmed down again and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">By 19 -- by the end of the summer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And again, I was shipped to the center of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was eighteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But the safety of my grandmother was utmost. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I was sent down south to take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">In the meanwhile, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , which was the most -- considered the most exposed city of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> 1n spite of the <span class="DLF">Maginot Line</span> -- was completely evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">All the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> was evacuated and sent down to the to the Périgeaux, to the Department of the Dordogne. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join the flow of refugees going down south and they went near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nancy</span> , where they rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, here I am south with my grandmother and -- when things settled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But because you had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And so I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blamont</span> , where my parents were living, with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And there we were waiting for the war to finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had just with us whatever we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And when the winter came, we needed some more clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I remember to this day, going with a "safe- conduct" -- that what you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">A "sauf-conduit."” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , my brother and I. It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghost town</span> with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter clothes and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blamont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In the meanwhile, I took a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , in, in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I worked there, while the bombs, the bombings were starting, and taught in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blamont</span> in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And so we were in -- I think the invasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My very religious family had prepared everything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the <span class="DLF">road</span> on the Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And here we were, loading as much as we could in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and taking off direction unknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Coming through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and crossing over. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And we were very close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">As a matter of fact, a neighbor of ours had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Was a crippled lady and her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And nobody to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my brother with... And we drove for five days and five nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We drove with the bombings going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> of people just carrying with them whatever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were fortunate we always find a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But anyway, we ended up in the somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and we heard that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">This was June 6th, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And here we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Couldn't go any back. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Couldn't go any forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we waited to see what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">What would happen was that all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> were expelled because <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was divided into two <span class="REGION">zones</span> : the northern * Safe-conduct (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="80">part and the <span class="REGION">southern part</span> , with a <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lorraine</span> were annexed, and became <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- became German right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Like they had done so many times before -- before the World War II, before World War I, and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And so all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> were expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And relatives were ma -- were coming down over the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my father and my brother managed to find a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , that is where -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a guard, in a big chateau in the southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Périgeaux</span> , in the free zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">there were, there was -- there were my parents, my grandmother, my brother, myself; and then two uncles, two aunts, two cousins and two German men who had come -- had escaped from the -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And we took them on...on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">One of my great guilts about that period is that I wasn't -- I didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We were -- we felt safe in this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , where we were going to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We were going to have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I really didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And my family was not very new, were not -- wasn't oriented to this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I was -- we were surviving there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was milking the cows, literally. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">One morning the gendarme’ came -- the French police, the French gendarme -- and asked for our two German men. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were rounding them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I was so unaware of what was going on that I went to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But one was smart enough, aware enough, to jump out of the back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And the other one, of course, they took along. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">To this day I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The Jews had to register in the south of -- we never had to wear the, the star in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but as Jews we all had to register with the Commisariat aux Affaires Juives’-- the, the special <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And my parents registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I suppose I did, too, although I don't remember that particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But somehow during this first year there, I got a call -- I got a, I got a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I think it was a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don't think we had a phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Certainly we had no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We had no phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I got a call from one of my former leaders in the Jewish scouting movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I'm going to mention her name, because she's so well known: Andrée Salomon is known by everybody for her incredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And had already started doing so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , when all -- when German Jewish parents started to send children across the <span class="DLF">border</span> for us to... And they were placed in families throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And Andrée was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a few years ago, before I ever really cleared this up. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But she said they -- I was needed in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and explained the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And this is the first time I knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And to this day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But I packed and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Not very much support from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I was very distressed because my mother was not terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Of * Soldiers of the Police Militia (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="123">> The correct name of this bureau is: Commisariat Général aux Questions Juives [Commission for Jewish Affairs] (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="124">course, there were plenty of people on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I, and I Just packed my things, and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I'm sure you know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , but I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I went there, and became a resident -- a worker for OSE.</span><span class="sentence" id="129">° At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame Salomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then there were other organizations that, like the OSE, had resident workers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE,’ and a number of other rescue agencies — Secours Suisse,” particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The Swiss Relief Agen... I'm not sure exactly what it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And the primary job of these agencies was to help improve the conditions of the people there, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> hygienic and physical conditions were beyond descriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was situated in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where what I remember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called "La Tramontane,"” which, the people being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They couldn't, they couldn't walk in the wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was still some Spanish refugees from the Franco wars, and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were all the Jews that had been deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> , from areas along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , on the -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Some of them had already been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , another very infamous camp in the southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">After a year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Because, although as I understand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much of it disappeared on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And one of the jobs of OSE, which was originally actually a medical social agency, was to provide extra rations for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So that became one of the important tasks of OSE, to distribute whatever it could. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Some day it was milk from the Secours Suisse. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Sometimes it was dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Sometimes it was a handful of olives. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And always a little bread that we had to divide. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I shall never forget entering into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and dividing the breads in eight pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And how can you make them exactly equal? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So we put numbers of them, so that it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So that no one would be slighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I remember handing a man in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> a piece of bread and his just falling back. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That was the condition of the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And, of course, the men lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and the women in their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">° Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Organization for Children’s Rescue] (French). ” </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Comité d’Inter-Mouvement aupres des Evacués [Committee of Inside-Movement related to Evacuants] (French). * </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Swiss Rescue (French). ” </span><span class="sentence" id="158">North wind; Tramontana (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And the children, we tried to keep them in special ilot'” where we kept the children, and tried to provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A lot of little activities, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">My -- but the particular purpose for my going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> was to take care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Oh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I remember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I had two hundred and eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat.'' </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I've been trying to do something in one, one big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But there were wonderful people among the internees. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There were some people who -- whose moral fiber was just such that they wanted to do something for the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So there were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And we tried to provide whatever we could and -- with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Singing, dancing --whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I also created some groups of girl scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I mean, girl scouts in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It sounds ridiculous when I think of it today, but that's all I knew 1n, in, 1n activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So I created girl scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But when I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">In the meanwhile, OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The procedure is well-known today. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the permissions through some very cooperating officials in the Department de Herault, where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perpignan</span> was -- no -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hérault</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perpignan</span> , in a neighboring Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">To get the children into <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And once they were there we could of course disperse them into the very number of <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> after having transferred the children from the <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Because- all nght, I have to back-track a little bit there. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">OSE had already set <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> up around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the late '30s for children who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In fact, I had been offered a job in one of these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and instead went to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So we had all these <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But it was not only that. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was it was persuading the parents to let the children go. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Mind you, at that time we had not- deportations had not started yet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They were still -- we are still in the early part of 1942 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But there were rumors of shipping the people off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resettlement camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Far from us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But OSE had had the foresight, through some people like Andrée Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of saving the children and getting them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to convoy children out or to take children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I remember one particular group that sticks in my mind of all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of

<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  What was that trip like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  I only remember that, that -- the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">What it was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I know I got them to safety in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergerac</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but we got them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And that was in August, I think, of August of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was again a matter of sending people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> -- to work <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resettlement camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I think we should have known that that wasn't quite it, because they were rounding up. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see the young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp of Rivesaltes</span> and crossing the <span class="DLF">line</span> over as their name was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I also remember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches, and walking over that empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Now, I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I had learned a lot about humanity while I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I remember one woman, and to this day I remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Do you want her name? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">She was Madame Grynszpan. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">In fact, she was an aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> because he killed the attaché in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she managed to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And she says, "The day you are going to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I know she escaped, because I -- one day I saw her on the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And, of course, I made no effort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I -- one thing 1s that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and some of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I was, I was very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I remember these first <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> there, and people were boarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Now, I do not remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">These were regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But what I remember mostly, too, was during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naive we were -- and thought that it was going to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some -- or in World War I, I should say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">If you had been born one, one parent, there were categories who were non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Or if you had resided for that long in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So we scrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying them somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But I know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We had all of a sudden, people were all in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty people out of, of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And we went through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because we had these wonderful papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">What we didn't know 1s that there was a quota for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other people were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">When I discuss -- I remember discussing this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> a few years back with Jacqueline, and she said she shared exactly what I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She said when she found that out it was a nightmare to realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that we so miraculously saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Nobody was saved, finally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  How did you choose the people to save?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Be--because we had the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We, we didn't choose anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We managed to, to put together a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We didn't choose anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean, the papers came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This certificate and that certificate, and this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So we didn't choose them. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We -- oh, gosh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Nobody played God. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But that's what -- that's how we got them out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be added to the quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Can I stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I need to take something for my headache. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It's just getting so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I have to take another pill. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  That's the point I want, I would like you to make then -- that you were doing all of this under your own name. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Ok, we're back again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September and through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">First it was the foreign-born Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then it was different -- other categories of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And then it was Jews, period, that were rounded-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> became the center from which they were sent off to destination unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as many children as possible through the legal means. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And when the legal means didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Because we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came loaded with Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> to try to separate the children from the families right then and there so that we could get them in the special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for the children and work on their liberation right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to separate from their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And we had them in, 1n, in the special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for their parents, where they matured so quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as they worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we became also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family reunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> , to get the children back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for family reunion purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So we had to try to avoid that as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Both in the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , which was impossible when they rounded up the kids, but when they came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And some, of course, were deported with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">By the end -- I forget exactly the date -- when the invasion of <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> came about by the Allies -- all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I remember the Germans coming down south. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">In fact, coming there had been no Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">This was strictly Vichy government. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But when the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started harder and harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I remember one particular one on Simchat Torah.'* </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And on Simchat Torah, the very religious Jews, about to be put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> into the into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , were dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But this was still a holiday that we're celebrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And truckloads of Jews were coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And rounded up all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And among them, some French-born Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">In the meanwhile, we continued to get the children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers, who was liberated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was eventually placed into my family to help my parents at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">She is still living today in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and is my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She married my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">This is a girl who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> of Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So when the war came, they were all put into Rivesaltes: her two parents, her two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The father was deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">The older brother joined the Maquis’ -- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible condition that I have never found out the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The younger brother was placed by OSE, by one of our network workers; and is living still in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And Rachel living with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And her mother survived -- also helped by OSE. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She just died a year ago in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So by the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And all the kids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to the various <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> , I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And, of course, also into the youth facilities of the Jewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And, of course, we had to lie about the ages; and, of course, we had to get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">See, by then we still had not directly worked in an underground or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we tried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I remember always wearing a cape. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Girl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And you could get a baby under your arms, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And you could walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The Secours Suisse smuggled * Rejoicing of the Torah (Hebrew). '</span><span class="sentence" id="325">° Anti-Nazi military partisans, associated with other groups in the French Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we smuggled children out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> under milk cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And we there are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly is the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But I don't remember what happened afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We handed them over to another network. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Each one of us did only one piece of the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was closed in November or December 1942, and whoever was left was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice because of the living conditions there at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we social workers didn't have any more better hygienic conditions than the internees, ‘though I had an individual <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We had one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where all the workers had an individual <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But we had no toilet facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And we had one bucket that each one of us took turns having in our own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We also had bed bugs infesting everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it was run over with worms by the time I got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway, because it was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Rutabagas, Rutabagas. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Never in my life again ever, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  What -- before, before you go on from here, what was it like for Simone Weil? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you're a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">What did it feel like to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Did you miss your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Were you feeling that you took any risk in doing this, even though it was legal? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">What was it like for you doing all these things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  At this time it was not illegal yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You know, people have asked me, "Did it ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The same kind of question. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">First of all, you're young. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And when you're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And I think my the other workers were my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was it was sort of a natural thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">There was a job to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was a natural thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It just I don't think I really thought much of the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It was very interesting; you ask me about risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> command the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a police commissar of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in which I had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And he knew my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I'll talk about him again later. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">There is a connection there. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take on these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just maybe, things would not have worked out the way they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">For us, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I guess for me the risk I took -- occasional trips to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Taking a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was no excursion. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> There were so few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I usually traveled with a knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And you tried to get your knapsack through a <span class="DLF">window</span> ; and you climbed through a <span class="DLF">window</span> , and you stood up all night in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Or I remember standing up all night in the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You know, we were -- there were so few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and so little means of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So I did occasionally go back and see my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I don't not often, but I, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">What I did, actually, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I was- and actually, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And but I -- by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , by that time, they would not let any new workers come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and he says, "Y ou better take care of your -- " I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And I really had to take a rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So I did go back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> just to recover from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">From that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And when, when I was healthy enough again, then I went to work in one of the <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Because I couldn't get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , and here were all these <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I had the background in education early childhood education. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I took a job as the chief educator, for OSE again, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And my family wasn't far. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The <span class="DLF">farm</span> wasn't far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poulouzat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The Director was Monsieur Job, who later became one of the administrator of OSE, who's still alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , whom I still correspond with, whom I still see when I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And here we were, taking care of the children whom we had gotten out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="392">This was a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that catered to maybe 50 children of all ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- "normal" in quotation marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Again, the food situation was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I remember sorting out rice in which mice had gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And taking out the, the rice doo. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Is that what you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">If it's dog doo, it's rice mice doo. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We ate it, because that's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And making do. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And, and yet, and, and cutting out things of the papers to decorate the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And, and I worked at creating as Jewish an atmosphere as we possibly could, leading Shabbat services. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Because of my background, this was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I could do these things very easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I tutored some of the kids who had missed schoolings, some who were prepare preparing their baccalaureate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , but still under their real names. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And this is 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I also remember that the drama coach who came on weekends or whatever to teach to, to take care of the kids, was Marcel Marceau, of all people. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Whose real name is not Marcel Marceau, but whose real name is Marcel Mangel (ph), and who was a kid from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And so we had the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He was a student at that time, doing artwork in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But these were these were my peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">You know, he's a little bit younger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But by that time the OSE Direction had seen the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Some <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> had been rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The police was coming to pick up the over-16. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The police -- the French police I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets, because here was a group of Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So at that time, the OSE Direction had decided that the children had to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in two steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">There was one step: they was under their real names, into non- Jewish kind of settings, but mostly, to form a clandestine network and place the children under assumed names. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And workers were recruited for that, and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">what * Tn <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , this is the equivalent of a high school diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">were the qualifications? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">None, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Wanting to do it, but also not being not looking "Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Quote, unquote. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I mean, there are some people who just simply couldn't do it because they were "typés,"” as we called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And so I qualified. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And Georges Garel, who is organized this clandestine network for OSE, recruited me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poulouzat</span> in <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> where I worked because all the <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> were going to be closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">In the meanwhile, there had been arrétes -- arrests -- in the Direction of OSE and the various <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There had been really -- 1t was danger with knowing where the children were, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So I got recruited for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And this was towards the end of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I therefore left the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> , and took up <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> is about what -- 60, 75 miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Well, I had to change identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And my name was Simone Weil, and I decided on "Werlin (ph)," because it was sort of easy to change the "I" to an "R" and to add something at the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I had to work on getting, number one, a nationality -- a Fiche de Nationalité.'</span><span class="sentence" id="439">° I'm not quite sure how I got it, but I have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And from that on -- oh, and I made myself being born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toul</span> , because we -- I knew that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toul</span> , the, the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> had been bombed and all the documents had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And by then, there was really a whole network of people working in forging false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So we had access to identification cards, blank ones and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But I did it, really, the legal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">After I had a Fiche de Nationalité by which I think I got by just making a statement -- then I had that, claiming that papers had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I couldn't produce a birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I got an identification card and gave a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> address, and immediately then moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And had myself registered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So it was perfectly legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I mean, it was perfectly ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">The most wonderful thing -- my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was the help I got from the Director of the school of social work and the director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of early childhood education. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">One lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Clermont-Ferrand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">One lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I took the trip, and I just simply told them that I needed their help. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I have in my documents still a certificate stating that I that Simone Werlin was their student in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I got a certifi-- I got a diploma established in on that name, under my false name. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I got some others you know, other statements to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And to this day, I am convinced that at the time I was arrested, to which I'm going to come later, that these papers helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And these people, without, without any question, just established these papers for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">In fact, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I remember very well, because this is the first trme I saw people wearing the yellow star because we did not wear it in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I also needed a cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And the Department of Public Health put me on their fictitious payroll, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But I had a statement saying that Simone Werlin is employed by the Department of Public Health. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And just to make sure that I knew what I was, what the Department of Public Health was, I went at least there once. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And now comes a funny story. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You know what department was assigned to? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The department that checked the health of the prostitutes of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they were coming regularly to that <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> to be examined, and that was my ° Typed or stereotyped (French). '</span><span class="sentence" id="470">® Nationality card (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="471">assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But at least I knew what my assignment was so that later on I had to describe it, I could describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But it has a little funny aspect to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I got a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , stayed with two elderly ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And we had a team working together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I remember at least two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">One was a cousin of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And we all had assumed names. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And children would come to us, brought from various <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> by a worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Brought to us, for us to change the identity of the kids, and then place them in various <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> , families, convents, what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">This was our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And transportation was mostly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Or walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Whatever we could round up. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And it ended up by, by having around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , in that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , we had some three hundred and fifty kids placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The Direction of the <span class="REGION">region</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , in that <span class="REGION">region</span> , we had between three and 350 kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It was a matter of finding the <span class="NPIP">places</span> and trying to finding following up with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">What I remember most dramatically — and, and also sometimes through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> came groups of children that had to be escorted towards other workers, who would help them get into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And I remember one group of children that came one night, and we had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I in some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or some <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And we worked feverishly all night to get them false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">For the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And take out the labels out of their clothes that the mothers had lovingly sewed into their clothes and take those labels out. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And look through their luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Take away whatever they had because they had to have be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And just coach them in what their new identity was. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I have often said that if I had known then what I have since learned, being a clinical social worker, I think I would have been completely immobilized by the, the traumatization that these children went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I could have just not functioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it was just a matter of saving lives, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and spreading them through a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and coaching them. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Some who spoke French was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Some who spoke with an accent, they were supposed to be from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And telling them what their name was, and knowing how to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And getting spreading them through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and getting them across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And there, getting them to another team of workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That was the end of my mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And they would then be handed over to somebody else, and gotten into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And kids came day and night, and we changed their identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">One of the source of help was the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And the <span class="REGION">area</span> the <span class="REGION">area</span> close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateau</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> , which has an arch archbishop-- archbishopric. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Is that the word? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And I went to see the Archbishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> , to ask him for making -- it easy mak-- making the entry into convents and to all <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanages</span> easy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But he knew what was the object of my mission, but it was never discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I had never encountered an archbishop in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I went to the Archbishop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> , and he gave me a letter of introduction to the various <span class="BUILDING">Catholic institutions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He also handed my hand with his ring, and I hadn't the slightest idea what I was supposed to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But that was a minor detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I also worked with Protestant agency that ran <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> for kids who had to flee <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And she also -- this was a partisan social worker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> , who was very unhappy being in this very Catholic kind of <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And she had no idea what the real object of my work was. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">All I wanted is place children in her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I hit it off with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And because she was so unhappy as a Protestant 1n this Catholic environment, taking me for a Catholic we had some discussion which made her say that she had never met such a liberal Catholic as I. I haven't the slightest idea what I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But when the dis-- when the questions became too difficult, I managed to escape by pretending that I wasn't feeling well and going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But anyway, we had the openings to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> , for our children, and that's where we placed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I worked at that time with another worker, who was actually not Jewish, Ann-Marie, and with two other workers who were not Jewish, among in our team, as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">At one time and at one time and, of course, the as the war was drawing closer and closer to an end, the round-ups just continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Both my parents were arrested at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And ‘though I had -- by that time, the uncles and aunts had left; and there was just my both my parents, my grandmother, my brother and, and the girl we had placed, you know, who placed from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The uncles and aunts had gone elsewhere, found their own <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I had provided my parents with false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But, when in the spring of 1944, the gendarmes came up and said to my father, "Etes-vous Juif, Monsieur?""’ </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He said, "Out, Monsieur.""</span><span class="sentence" id="535">® And they took both my mother and my father, leaving -- and my brother pretended that he was the farm hand, and my sist-- my future sister-in-law, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">She was the maid, she pretended. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And both my parents were interned in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But the French police actually went over and beyond the expectations of the German authority, and had taken my mother to a camp that was only for men. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So after 24 hours, they sent her back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And I had heard had word of my father being in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So I -- oh, I always traveled in something that looked like a Red Cross uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Something navy-bluish, and some Red Cross sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I mean, it was really nothing real, but it looked like a uniform, so I had access to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And through some cigarettes or tobacco or something, I got a message to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Who, by the way, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Because on D-Day 1944, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was attacked by the Maquis and the internees were able to escape -- among which my father who returned to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But in the meanwhile, there was great concern for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And I managed to come back, round-up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from the Maquis -- from the underground -- and load my grandmother into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and get her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Périgueux</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> near the, the city prefecture where we lived, and get her into an <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And a very nice gentile woman would visit her regularly there. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But aside from the other work that I did, it was one of the most dramatic things that I did because she was nearly blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And she said, "Don't leave me here!" </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was on the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> and she 'T “Are you French, Sir?” (</span><span class="sentence" id="554">French). </span><span class="sentence" id="555">'S “Ves, Sir.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="556">French). </span><span class="sentence" id="557">couldn't find her things, but I had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I left her, but she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Not very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">She never came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span> , but she did survive the, the this period of the <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Also when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , you know, Georges Garel, the head of our network, would appear from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And he appeared one morning, having come from God knows where. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And coming to that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which I rented and say, "You know, we have to move very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The members of the Jewish Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Périgueux</span> have all been shot as in reprisal for God knows what had happened to some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The Director one of the Directors, Monsieur Lederman, has been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He has -- his wife has had died the year before of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And he has two daughters in a <span class="BUILDING">private boarding school</span> , and we have to get them out of there." </span><span class="sentence" id="568">What he didn't know...that Monsieur Lederman was my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And these were my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And they were two young teenagers, and I called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I had the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">How we got calls through is a puzzle to me today; but the phone must have functioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I called them in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in which they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I told them, "You pack up, and you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , and I'll be at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And there was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I don't know how I made it through the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And we got them into a safe <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we had at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> .; </span><span class="sentence" id="581">there was gentile lady who loaned us the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we could do our papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I remember changing their name to Ledormier. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And while we were there, I do remember the Milice’” coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But the Milice didn't come to -- they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They were just looking at <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But they came, and I jumped out the <span class="DLF">back window</span> with my two cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And also Ann-Marie tells me it was the paper of her husband who had been deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and who -- whose papers she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I don't remember that, but as we put our selected memories together, we reconstructed. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And I reconstructed the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">As a matter of fact, while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> I found that hou-- that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And I knew it was it because I saw the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  So we continue with the story of my cousins, where I left it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Just a year ago, one of my cousins came to see me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And she got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And I waited for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">She says, "This is the second time that you're waiting for me someplace." </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And she remembered the time I was waiting for her at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But then she said, "When you called us in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where we were to tell us to pack and come, we didn't know whether it was really you." </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Distortion of the telephone. "</span><span class="sentence" id="607">And we had really didn't know whether it was a trap for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And whether it was a safe thing to do, to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , until we saw you at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And that devastated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And actually, they did not know their father had been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And they're telling me that I had to tell them that their father had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They thought he had been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I do not remember this, nor do I remember so many of the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I have recently encountered a woman who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> , who was a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> who I got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> and who I placed in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> later on and went back to work with me in a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> that I had later. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">She survived this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Her family was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And she went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> soon after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And she gives me all these details. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And I believe her because it fits into what I remember, but I don't remember her, and I don't remember the details of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I do not remember individuals as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I remember my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That's somewhat in some way different -- it's very close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I see myself going into <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I see myself talking to children, talking to families. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I remember the incident of the, the Archbishop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I remember being arrested -- and I'm going to come into that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But the individual kids, I do not remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Exc-- I remember the groups, and not one in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I do remember the one day that I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">75 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">In my memory, it was a straight route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Six or seven years ago, we went back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I told my husband, "Don't worry, it's...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We're going to have to stop the tape. [</span><span class="sentence" id="635">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION] You started to tell me about the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  On regular intervals, I guess, I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , which was really the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I remember some of the workers there having to do with papers, or having to do with whatever instructions we had about our network, our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I remember walking with this other worker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And treating ourselves to some of these coupon-free pastries. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We had to -- we could go into a <span class="BUILDING">pastry shop</span> , and they had made some pastry out of some God knows what ersatz stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And coming out of it, and a young man coming to us, and saying, "Follow me." </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And opening the big book he had under his arm, which was not a book but something that hid a box with a revolver in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The -- 1t was clear that they were not after me as well as after Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Charlotte was living in -- she looked very Jewish, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">She was very "typée." </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And they suspected her to be part of the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And he marched us with this gun under his arm to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And there, ransacked her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , looking for I'm not sure what. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But I had sewn in the lining of my pocket some seals, to make false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">You know, of <span class="BUILDING">city halls</span> and <span class="BUILDING">town halls</span> , and dates and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I also had, on cigarette paper, the coded list of my children, because -- I didn't mention this earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">OSE had a list of the children with their real names and their false names, with copies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Not one identity was ever lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Some children were lost, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But no identity ever got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And we had codes in which way we were keeping lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I mean, these identities available. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I had that with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And here I was, watching calmly as they were ransacking Charlotte's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and trying finding a way of getting at least rid of this incrim-- incriminating documents I had on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So I asked to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And what I know how to do was to act as a very innocent little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I think I can still do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And that simple little slip, on their part, saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , got everything out of the lining of my pocket, got the papers out, flushed whatever I could down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> , threw everything that I could out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and came back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> clear of all this incriminating stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I knew that, you know, we'd get some other seals and we'd get the lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They were saved somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Legend has it already that I swallowed the cigarette papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But I'm sure I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I'm sure I threw them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I get back and they went through my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And this is where I want to come back to the wonderful paper I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I always carried with me all these document that these very helpful people had made out for me -- my diplomas, my cert-- I had everything with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Library cards which had false from pre-war library cards, under my false name. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I had university student cards, and etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I had all this with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They slipped on one thing, which have which would have been my undoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I had given an address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> as my original. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I had my identification card. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I didn't even know where the <span class="DLF">street</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I didn't even know whether it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">If they had asked me to take them there, I couldn't have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So I left this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">they imprisoned Charlotte, but we managed to liberate her to help her escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And she's still living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  How did you help her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  I don't -- we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I wasn't part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">The resident workers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I don't know how they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I haven't the slightest idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I was very anxious to retrieve my knapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And so I got in touch with another worker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and got out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And then I got my knapsack back, and then I went back on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> 75 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Now, just a few years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, "Oh, I know who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You spent the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">You were arrested in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I have absolutely no memory of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">She remembered the incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">She remembers Charlotte, and how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But for me, I was anxious to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> with my cleansed knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I remember this as a straight route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And I took it a few years back, and it was the rollercoast-- the worst rollercoaster road. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And my husband said to me, "This 1s a straight <span class="DLF">road</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="709">In my memory, this was a straight <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And no sooner did I get to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that my landlady says, "Your friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> came to see you, and you were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Needless to say that I spent no time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , and took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> , where I had somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But you see, it wasn't always <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Whenever we could, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">luggage compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And we went as far as we could on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Maquis</span> had blown up the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We were always rejoicing when the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , and we went a little bit further. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So that way, we, we traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I even remember getting a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> part of the way, putting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> were, were sure that I was somewhat safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">There's another crazy incident that I do remember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> was the Commissar de Police from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">He ended up being the Commissar de Police of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , where I was doing underground work. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I did something which today seems absolutely crazy to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And I told him, "I know you know who I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="726">But I told him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And I was expecting him to leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">In retrospect, 1t sounds absolutely totally crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But he never bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you know, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you know, "See what I did for you?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says, "He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp of Rivesaltes</span> and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been, you know, more to his credit." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, “How did it feel?” </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I got a sense of invulnerability. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And you, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was in the in the escape, the routes to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- or whether it was in the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Maquis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">We did it because that was the thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I thought it was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">It wasn't over by far. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And I put my the gold little flag on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , but very quickly put it back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very good Catholic girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday morning in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But anyway, it was too early to really tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I was I was just exploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies had landed, that didn't mean at all that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And then the fierce battling went on -- the bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went when there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">This was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was just a community work. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And that went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And as reprisals, very nearby was this horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole population in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and put fire to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">This was non-Jews as well as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I mean, it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But don't ask me the details of how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I know it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I know we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I know I did it, but I don't remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">More kids coming, and I know we placed more kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I, I know this was a, a very hectic period. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish girls celebrating Passover that spring, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And one of us watching, standing guard at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , just like Marrano-type kind of celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">These, some of these little details come up once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really, as to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">With very few exceptions, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">My sister-in-law, those of my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And the only explanation I can come up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals, for fear of loss, for fear of getting too close. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And so that I do not remember individual stories, with the few exceptions that I gave you. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Also is I left the United -- I left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I had one urge and that 1s to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I never spoke French to my children, never talked about any of that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was all something to put behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us who feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">When the war was over in our in my <span class="REGION">area</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span> , in the fall of 19-- oh, just before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And from one <span class="NPIP">stage</span> to the other, and got them back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Because that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had, having lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to spend there. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and I reopened the first <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montintin</span> , in the center of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It was a big old chateau which had been a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And it was populated by rats and by filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And we cleaned the rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">To today, I stand on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> if I see a mouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">In those days, we put traps in, and we caught one rat after another, and we cleansed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And we got as quickly as we could the children out of the <span class="BUILDING">religious institutions</span> , of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic institutions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And we had no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be until the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> that we really had the reality of what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So we did the best we could to create as quickly as we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">With nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">With whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We had staff survive -- survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I remember particularly one couple from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And I had really a desire to do something in my <span class="DLF">field</span> , and that is, create a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for pre-school children. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Because pre-school is, was and has always been -- and continues to be -- my area of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And OSE then replaced, replaced me at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montintin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> -- but not for OSE, but for the Unitarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the auspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for pre-school age children. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Later on, when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really copied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We initiated the same model. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And these children had survived tn hiding -- but not only children who had survived in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Children who were entrusted to us by parents who couldn't handle them. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They had survived themselves, but they were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And for a period of time, we had these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But it was also a training school for early childhood educators. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So we set up a Montessori program in, in the -- in a <span class="BUILDING">chateau</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , which, by coincidence, happens to be the one where I had taught in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> , surrounded by ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And there I stayed until -- this was '45 -- and all the do-gooders from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">A WAAC” gave me some shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">That was wonderful! </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And they brought us candy, and they brought us all kinds of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to continue my training, to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and continue on with my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">To tell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I would have gone anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">This was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Was I was ready for a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And why me? </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Why not Jacqueline? </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Jacqueline didn't know English. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">She was just as qualified, but I knew English. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">This was a scholarship offered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships to give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in Europe, not just in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And would return to their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to continue to improve the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So I had a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon letters upon letters to get me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and I came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">warship</span> in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And the Council of Jewish Women sent me to <span class="BUILDING">Tulane University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And for one year, but extended my scholarship for a second year, which I completed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , and got my Master's Degree in social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">But I did return to ** Women’s Army Corps (WAC after 1978). </span><span class="sentence" id="832"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And there I am worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> and all these children had to reassess the needs of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I did survey upon survey of facilities -- not just OSE of various <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> -- to assess their need and to see what else could be done with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I also set up L'Association des Travailleurs Juives~’. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I started with training workers in the various <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , with my newly acquired wisdom in social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And I started this program going, going through the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And after a year, I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And that's the end of the story, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I continued in social work for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">What had that year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">Tulane University</span> I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in my own work and in my own experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no intention of getting a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">It was just a year to be exposed to things here. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So I didn't work very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Why talk about my war experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Everybody else had done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And why did I have to talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And yet I did because I was their first student. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I went to their triennial conventions, and I talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I don't know what I said and how I told the story then. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">There was a lot of publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And it bothered me for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">One, because as I said, 1t seemed so natural to have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Everybody did it, in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And how can you sort of make it this beautiful story? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">There was just one other thing is that there were there was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And I accepted to talk, provided they sent packages overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And that was one of the, you know, redeeming features of my talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">When I transferred to Case Western -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">It wasn't Case Western, it was <span class="BUILDING">Western Reserve University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I got a somewhat different experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And yet, I remember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had been or what, what my expertise. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I mean, after all, I had left I was By then, I was 26 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I was not a kid fresh out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I mean, this was <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> because I got credit for all my work I had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I didn't find -- what surprised me very much 1s the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds of things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And there was a naiveté about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">It was all textbook kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And I said, "Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too." </span><span class="sentence" id="881">You *! </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The Association of Jewish Workers (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="883">know, it's not just in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that they have invented social work, or that we -- to me, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no nuances. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Social workers were being trained to work in <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I did my field work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bellfaire</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , which was one of the top-notch child-care agencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">To me, it made much more sense to do it the way we did it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and that is, train the house parents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We would train people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who lived with the children, who were with them all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And that didn't make sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Does that answer your question? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And but more, I think one of the reasons I was just thinking of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">One of the reasons I clamed up, too, 1s that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">The questions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And it's hard to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">It still happens today. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I'll give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Very recently, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> , I was asked to talk to a <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very active in the community there. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And could I come and talk about my own experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And I did, at what I hoped it would be <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> level -- which is not particularly my forte, but I tried to tailor it to, to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And especially ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And the kids were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">They really had some very pertinent questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">The teacher, when I recalled the incident of being arrested and, and Charlotte being put into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , said, "But on what basis did they arrest her?" </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming! </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And, and in front of the kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I said, "This 1s war. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">This is you know, you don't have to have any reason." </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So in retrospect, I think, also this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The other thing is, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> we really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">That's how I met my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">He's, he's from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">He has a whole other saga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But there was a group of what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">This was really my circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">One of my very close friends was from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">My husband's friends were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And you didn't have to dwell on these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">It was part of what you brought with you to your daily living. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And, and I realized, when I started talking about it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in Syracuse had a workshop for teachers 1n the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> to teach the Holocaust, to introduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I participated in this workshop. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Again there was, you know, when I say “Rivesaltes” to most my, my close friends or the people who come from Europe or come from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , it immediately evokes something. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But then I have to go into the detail as to what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , how Rivesaltes. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">When I went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> from '83 to '86. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So I retired from my -- I was teaching at <span class="BUILDING">Upstate Medical Center</span> by then, in the pediatric residency program. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And my clinical practice as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So here I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people I had worked with in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And we put together our selected memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO~ -- which is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time for this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a program of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">It surprised me. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">But then I realized there's a new generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And they were mostly Jews from <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> , because the Sephardic community is so much bigger in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> today than it's ever been. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And these Jews had all been coming in the '50s -- after the war -- and they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Yet, at the same time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And when I said “Rivesaltes,” or when I say and name any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , there is some response, which made it easier for me to talk there. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And even to talk here. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And that, that's a reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I'll probably think about it tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to do this, to give these talks in the first person. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's the only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> recently relate to exp-- pieces of experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Each one comes away with another little piece, not the whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to anything that's fictionalized about the sho’ah,”” the television series on the sho’ah, or anything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">To me, it's not the real stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And maybe something remains for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I feel that responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I really do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview ** Women’s International Zionist Organization *° Holocaust (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Note: This section, the section on photographs and documents, has not been checked for accuracy, spelling, or authenticity. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS (1) This is the diploma of early childhood educator, which I recetved under my real name in 1940, I believe.
