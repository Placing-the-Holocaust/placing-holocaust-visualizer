<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Let's begin if you would with your liberation from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  lf we, if we start with the liberation was, | was liberated on August, on April, pardon me, on April 30th, 1945, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , actually in the side camp of . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">side camp</span> where most of the Jews were. </span><span class="sentence" id="29"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> had at that time, mostly Christians, political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And the Jewish prisoners, who had come from all part of, of Europe, mostly <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , they were sent into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">side camps</span> and we were in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kahlfring(ph</span> ) etcetera, in we were building underground <span class="BUILDING">munitions factories</span> for the Germans and for the V2, they were being built right <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> and there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camps</span> , | don't know how many, but quite a few, | was in one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We came there from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">| was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and yes, the uprising, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And on April 30th, we were in, well on April 24th, or 20, 20, somewheres the week before, 10 days before, we were in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite Camps</span> and we were marched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And, | don't know if it's in the previous tape, we were marched out and we marched for several days and we were told at that point, after we were halfway through, one night there'd be, the Germans told us this, had Instructions that the war is over and he have to take all these prisoners to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and the Red Cross has taken over and Red Cross was taking us all to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">In retrospect, was a lie, that was only to keep us calmed down and to make us subdued and they could handle us, so, but they marched us two more days and we were back, we were behind the <span class="DLF">wire</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So that was the easiest way to keep us together, not to have us escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Anyhow the, the American army liberated us early in the morning and this morning, interestingly enough, | got a picture from a man whom | met a year ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">His, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mill Valley</span> , across the <span class="DLF">Golden Gate bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He was one of the soldiers that liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that | was liberated, that morning and by pure accident, the reason we found each other, we gave, we honored liberators last year as a Yah Meshua(ph), 50th anniversary and we, our staff had a Jewish, a , send off ads and letters and they found 120 liberators in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , up and down the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , almost close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and into <span class="REGION">Oregon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">One of these men, during the dinner, that night we gave a dinner for, | was the chairman of it and during the dinner, he said to me, he saw the picture, that famous picture being, which was being used in, for all these years at, at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , he says, "That is not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It's a picture that you have seen on the, Dachau liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It really was Allach(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He said, "That's Allach." </span><span class="sentence" id="44">| said, "How do you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He said, "Because | know it as Allach." </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So he twist it back and by God we met again, surely | said and he, he showed me, "It is Allach(ph), | can tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it was Allach(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So | have the picture here, so I'm in the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And since then he, well he's very active in the 42nd division, the Rainbow division, which is the division we were liberated, who liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and this morning, | lunched with about two weeks ago, three weeks ago and this morning he sent me a picture, which | want to give to the, to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , | don't know if they have this, it's a picture of the American soldiers killing quite a few of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They lined them up, they lined them up on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and they killed them, until an American general came there and saw this happening and he went almost berserk, this general, I'm going to meet with him in a very, very, in the next couple of months, he's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He was so upset that they did this, he kicked, the machine gun, he kicked the soldier and stopped them using the machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And they had killed about 17 of the guards and maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He me that again this morning with the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And | didn't, | realized that | saw that happen, but that came back only today to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Anyhow, we were liberated and with my luck, a Dutch Red Cross came immediately., </span><span class="sentence" id="56">for some reason there was a connection about, there were several hundred Dutch Christians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and other who were, who were political prisoners, saboteurs to, to political, whoever, if they got you, if you're not with them, as you well know. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And this appear from the Dutch underground and others and the Dutch Red Cross came immediately, within 10 days, two weeks, to, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , Prince Bernardi(ph), then husband of the then Princess, who's now, who's now the Queen Mother already, Juliana's husband, came with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And they picked us up and they drove us all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , took about six, five, six days, the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were out, you know and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">| remember we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for some reason and , lggy Farben(ph) factory, which was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> and they kept us there for one or two nights, one night and we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , we, we were asked where we were from and | was not a Dutch citizen, | had no documentation, all | could say, | was from . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But I'd only, I'd only lived there since | was 10 years old, we came there 1936, we went over the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , only about 25 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Wasn't far enough obviously because they killed all my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And the Red Cross took me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to, to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berculo(ph</span> ) from the, from the, that, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savina(ph</span> ), where they, it was kind of an army, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army town</span> and that's where they held them for a day or two and, and assigned us where we wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we were, | was in a, in a, in a pair of black pants, which were some pants I'd taken off a soldier, an SS I'd killed and a toothbrush from the same SS man I'd killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the, and the shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We had no clothes except the striped things, which we couldn't get out fast enough and they were very filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So | was in some beat up German's uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then they gave us other clothes at the <span class="DLF">border</span> and as much , that's because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was in very bad shape in 1945, the Germans had plundered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And they took me back to my, what | call my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was

<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  In the Jewish press, there's a Jewish press, very . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So my friend found his sister's daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , he had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as a young boy and he went, this guy could move <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and found this girl, brought her back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1946 and she had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, he had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she moved in with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">She was 18, 16, 18, 18 by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And they fell in love and he want to marry her, except in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> you can't do that, that's against the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And so he made a request to Queen Wilhemina, is the only one who can do this, only the Queen and she can give you permission, whatever that's, that's called. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And she wrote him back there's no way | can do that, we don't do this and denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So he, when he came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , he came back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> and on that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where he was brought in over the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the Princess Julianna(ph), she visits <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , like to visit <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , wonderful family. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And she visit that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he was laying in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , he had come back out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they took a picture of her standing at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And she said to him, "If there's ever anything | can do for you, feel free, you can call me." </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Which is, which is like giving you a check you can cash when you need it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So he, so he wrote a letter after the Queen turned him down, to the Princess, said, "| want you to talk to your mother, | want to marry my niece." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And the Princess wrote him a letter back, these are all true stories. "</span><span class="sentence" id="528">I can't give you permission, my mother doesn't waive, no she said so as you well know, but if someday in the future, it will all, things work out normal, | will be Queen, I'm in succession and then you try again." </span><span class="sentence" id="529">1948, two years later, Wilhemina abdicated her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">throne</span> to her daughter, he didn't wait three weeks, he writes a letter to the Queen, then, "Remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Here's the picture." </span><span class="sentence" id="531">She gave permission and they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And they had two wonderful girls, they all live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> except he died on a trip in, he dropped dead in a at an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But before that, when | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , Emil was in contact, he called me one day, he says, Emil was making deals, American dollars, gold, you know and he says, "I'm coming in such and such a date next week and I'm in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> and you have to get me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">| knew this was all a scam, | knew right away that he wasn't in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> , but he sat in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> and what he had, he had, he was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> , on a cushion which was, which had maybe, in today's dollar, in those dollars, maybe three million dollars in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and Indonesian and Dutch government bond, who were totally worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Worthless because the Dutch government made an edict in '45, about within a month or two after the liberation, that everyone who had dollars, | mean gildens(ph), in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , had to turn them in and every person alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> got 10 gildens(ph) that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Every stock certificate had to be turned in and they forced every corporation or government to issue all new ones, because the Germans had falsified so many. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They had emptied all the safe deposit box, deposit boxes of the Jews and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So no one knew who was what and who owned what. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So Dutch made a cutoff day in '45, that no one was worth more than 10 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The phony money, the money, you went to the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , later on, every week you could get, release some of it because they couldn't give it to you , they had to print it and finally everybody got dollar for dollar and the Dutch, whatever they did economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So he now, so now it's 1948, about that time and he ran into a guy who says, "You know, | found in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> of my uncle, a whole box full of these bonds, they're worthless." </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So my friend is smart, he says, "Well," he says, "maybe | can do something with that." </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So he gave the guy, he says, "I'll give you 5,000 dollars for it, as a friend,", this man say, "but you have to deliver it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So | had friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but American army, soldiers | met. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And | arranged that | deposit some money in, it's a complicated situation, but | got to deliver 5,000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , through the Swiss, through a <span class="BUILDING">Swiss bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">but | had access to, to the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And he put up 2500, | put up 2500. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So now we own all these shares and he comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , | take him off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and he's got a whole big suitcase sitting on him and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And | have no way what to do with it, I've never done this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">| was leaving the next day for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lougano(ph</span> ), where we also had a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and | stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for a couple of years and | got to know the owner and | thought they are very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So that night, | had dinner with them the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and then | tell them, the biggest part of the part of this story, he says, "| know who can help you, | can help you," he says, "but the man you talk to is a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">| said, "I just came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He said, "Oh, you got to go back." </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So | went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> and | met this lawyer, | gave him a sample. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">From that, within three days | was followed by two plainclothesmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">| was followed for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Two weeks, it was in 19, in August '49, summer of '49. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And finally | got so scared, | said there's nothing | can do, they keep on following me and | don't know if they were police or they were gangsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">| thought about police. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So | walked up to them, they're sitting on a <span class="BUILDING">sidewalk cafe</span> and | sat, | sat down next to them, right on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , | said, "Are you following me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There was a younger man and an older man, they said, "No, I'm not." </span><span class="sentence" id="562">| said, "Well, you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Last week was somebody else, but there was two people following me." </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So | figured | got to have an emotional confrontation here, so | said, "Look, | know what you want, but I'm scared and | don't know how to handle this," , show them a number on my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">| said, "Look, I'm not a gangster, I'm a survivor the <span

illegal documents, | mean stocks, bonds and that's not done in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ," he says. "</span><span class="sentence" id="567">And we're going to put you in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because you're trying to sell that." </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And you, and we, and | didn't know if it was that, which, that's what he told me, but I'd also been buying up gold and | was smuggling it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , gold coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But you, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> | could, could make a huge profit every time | and | used packs of cigarettes, you know and things like that to smuggle them over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And maybe and | thought that could be also it. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So he says, "Know what you're doing, you're selling things." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So he says, | said, "How can I, how can | stop this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Says, "I'll tell you what we'll do," He was an older man and he became very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He says, "See my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> there?"

<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  Until a few years ago, maybe now it's 10 years, 12 years, not more than 15, nobody knew that I'd been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , | never talked about it, | didn't tell anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">People maybe, maybe people knew, people didn't ask me, | didn't tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">People didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">| got involved, through the Jewish family, , called me one day and | was active in the federation in '55 or, | mean every campaign since 1955. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But early Rob called me, he says, "Look, there was an incident with the Nazis in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sunset district</span> and we have to organize the survivors here. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">| know you're one," and we knew each other fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">He said, "And | want you to help me, because the survivors are going bonkers, | need to arrest one, one father and son who have burned a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi bookstore</span> and you're going to get involved." </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They weren't organized, so | got involved and from there and then we had this group, that I've chaired most of these years, | can't find a, a substitute, nobody wants it. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And they won't let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And immediately , every year now. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Then we built the, the memorial, you know, that <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust memorial</span> , and which Goldman and | chaired and others, but we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">She was the chairman, | was, | was the fundraising chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">She was the artistic chairman, | was the overall chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And then we, we build the...

<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Now when you say no one knew you were a survivor, what about your wife and your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  My wife knew a little, yeah we talked, but she never asked me, she didn't want me to talk, cause she didn't want me to think about it and talk about it and she tried not to have me see anything on television if she could help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">My children knew because they did it behind my back, they never asked me and one day, when they were in their middle teens, | remember it very vividly, | decided that | better tell these kids more than just what they hear, what they read and what they have extracted from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">So | took them individually, first one, then the other, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we drove up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sonoma</span> and | said, "Look, we going to, today we going to talk about, I'm going to tell you a few things." </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And they, unless, it felt like, they said both and | didn't tell one from the other, they both said independently, they weren't together, that | brought them separate, "We don't want to talk about it, we know all about it, we know, you don't have to tell us any more." </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So they didn't want and | think that was because my wife must have instilled that in them, they didn't want me to feel hurt and to think about it or talk about it, think about it, whatever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="919">ANSWER:  | was a little disappointed and then | also felt that they were very protective of me, so | dropped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They knew and they can read and they know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  Would you do it the same over again, if you knew now that...
ANSWER:  Yeah, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Yeah, | couldn't change that. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And that's the reason | want, I'm writing this book, so they have, so they can read it, but they, of course if they want to ask me, they could ask me, they never ask me and that's only because they want to protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And my grandchildren, who are six and eight, by the time they have, by the time can comprehend life a little bitter, better, , | may not be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So that's why | want to put it in writing.</span></p>
