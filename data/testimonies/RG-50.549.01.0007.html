we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But like us, for three, four days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still there's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But I, as | was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra bite, | went up on a -- it's bigger than a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , kind of a little -- little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and | was looking, looking and | found and | ate a full box of what | thought it was chocolate and | ate a box of Ex-lax. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">| didn't know, | was happy, | found chocolate, | ate it and you could imagine what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I, | got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and | walked Erwin Baum 7 December 5, 1995 Page 7 out of that, of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was this, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> there was the <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> that the soldiers were fed, and | went and | was crying, "Pain, pain, pain," and there was one American soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polish, and | told him that I'm so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So he put me in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , in, in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and drove me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> , put me in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They put me in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Oh, that was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, and I, | just walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and went on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">| went on my own and went into a little, a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> , | forgot the name, and | met with two other friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and there were, and, and on a, on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> with two German older sisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they have to take in and take care of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Because they, they think it was just the right thing to do or...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yeah, they didn't know, they thought that's the order, that the Germans, for them to pay back, they have to take care of, of people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Ampfing, that's the name, Ampfing, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we went to them and they took care of us, we ate and drank and they did our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We were there for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We got on our feet, then we decided to go to big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> .</span></p>
