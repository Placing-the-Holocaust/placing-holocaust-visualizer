<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Someday Ill pronounce that right. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And, okay so this was Leibush’s son?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  He had, well the first one was born and he died after a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So, three children, Shulim was the oldest, you want the children’s names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  All right, the second one’s name was Shlomo, he was born September the twentieth, ’31. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And then was the daughter Raisa, how do you say? {</span><span class="sentence" id="33">Rose.} </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Well, Rosa; she was born February 15, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">See, because I don’t know if you’ll use this, but I have pictures, so I will give you the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So this was from the next batch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  And Leibush, he at this time owned his own <span class="BUILDING">sales general store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Leibush, he owned the same <span class="BUILDING">store</span> as my father, I mean the same kind, <span class="BUILDING">wholesale general store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  I remember you saying Leibush was a big fellow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Well, he was not so big. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> he was considered big, but he was known -- everybody is known for something and he was known for his strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He was the strongest man, if somebody wanted to give an example he strong, so they said he’s as strong as Leibush. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So he was very well known, not that he used his strength for some fight or something, but he was known as the strongest man in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Is this something Shulim would have been proud of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes, I was very proud of it, because nobody would start up with me but he never got involved, but he was, I was always be proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And also when Jews never stood up against anything what was done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn’t take abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And there was one I write in the other book, once there was a draft commission, you know a draft commission came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came a few high Polish officers and a military doctor, and they conducted the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So once when Jews had to go to to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , they went by autobus. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The autobus went once a day, eight in the morning to so when the Jewish people, some Jewish people wanted to go on the autobus, so those officers were standing by the <span class="DLF">door</span> , they didn’t let in Jews and Leibush --. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I can, stop it......where were we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  We were talking a little bit about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leibush</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Okay, he had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I started to tell you about-----so those two officers, the three officers were standing in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> they didn’t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And there came also was standing a young woman and she had a sheitl a wig, because they were very religious, so when she wanted to go in they grabbed her by the hair and they pulled down the wig, she was very embarrassed because they were shamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">When my brother saw that they don’t let her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time, I would say about twenty years old, or twenty-one years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But he went and he wanted to go and he pushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pushed him so fast, he was standing there, that he fell on the other one and the other one, they all, three or four, they all fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And naturally he was afraid, so he run away, then the police came and they arrested my brother and there was a big case and they took about four, five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">This was taken to J toa <span class="BUILDING">superior court</span> and they made a big issue because who would touch a Polish officer? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The main thing, after he knocked them down all the Jews went in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but they had my brother arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But the main thing was that they asked the woman to be a witness who was pulled down the wig, and she didn’t want to be a witness, she was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But then later we had to hire big lawyers and it cost money and this was, but he was known about his strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When he was younger, I was a very poor eater so my mother used to say “I never had trouble with Leibush, because Leibush, when put down for breakfast a bread, he finished the whole bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He finished the whole loaf.” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So they ask Leibush, they ask him, “When do you know that you have enough?” </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He was not fat, when do you know it’s enough?” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So he said, he never said when he’s full or something, {when the muscles} not the muscles, how you call this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Jaw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  The jaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">When the jaw starts to hurt you, then he knows he has enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And there were other cases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one, he was known as strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So he came over once and said “Let’s wrestle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My brother said I don’t want to wrestle, I’m not a wrestler. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He said “Let’s wrestle.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He wanted to show he is stronger, so my brother didn’t want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said “Okay, let’s wrestle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It took a second, the other one was stretched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So then he said that he approved he’s the strongest. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And then he was with me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> after a year and we escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But in the end he died of a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and while he was on the visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> he died and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So this is about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leibush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Now, about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shulim</span> , now you have written down here, I don’t know, you have the record.....
QUESTION:  I have the copy back in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Shulim, here is not pronounced right, it’s not the A is not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">All right, so this you have corrected. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Now, you want me to read this over and correct it what is here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Well, let’s see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Let’s see what is important, what’s not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now this was written on the ID, let’s see what we can correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He’s a very beautiful boy, my nephew, I don’t see that this uh.....
QUESTION:  Yeah, I think we’re not going to use that voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You know, it’s going to be written.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Him. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Right, so he cannot say I’m a very beautiful boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He is three years old, his parents dressed him in a player’s show, cut his hair for the first time and brought him to the teacher at the <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">His father can hardly wait for the day when Shulim will begin his <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> education. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I think this is very.....1t’s not the right language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  So they can get better language, ’39 the Germans have taken over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Shulim nine years old, knows that he no longer goes to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> have been shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He didn’t have no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , this was <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and Jews couldn’t attend <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> anymore, not that the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he cannot walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , this was not right in the beginning, Jews could walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , but this was not the main thing because he is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But he doesn’t understand what lies behind these rules because I think the whole thing is, he couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were shut down; all <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">In 1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans were, we can say we were at this time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  In °42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  In 42, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established in July ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The Germans law was that all Jews twelve years and up had to wear the yellow armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We didn’t have a yellow armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The white with the blue Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Had to wear the white and blue armband, there was nothing, and register for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This 1s okay, we had to register from 12 to 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Getting the band was such a proud moment for Shulim, to him it meant he was now a man, that he was growing up to be like his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He never realized that it was part of the Nazi, I don’t use the word Nazi, as the Germans plan to kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I don’t who the Nazis, Shulim and German, maybe we can say the picture, because we’ll take out , the picture that he asked me, or he can say I asked my uncle to make a picture and I have a picture the day he put on the armband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  I know that picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  The picture, and when he shows off the band, because he was so proud of it so maybe this can be incorporated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  So he asked you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes, he bothered me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Uncle Naftali, can you make a picture of me with the....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Then I made the picture and I took the other children also and he showed the band. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Q He put it on the other arm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Well, no he had it on the right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He had it on the right arm, but he pulls out the arm to show the picture; he was so proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Shulim was transported with his mother, brother and sister to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belges death camp</span> where he was killed in July 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Now, should we.....
QUESTION:  July 19?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  No, July, I don’t know the date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Just July, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  July, 1942 because I don’t know because they were kept in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but in July he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now I don’t know if we should write anymore about his father, that his father survived, or just to let it go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Probably just let it go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  What else do you remember about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shulim</span> as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Well I remembert....
QUESTION:  Did he like certain things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  He was a very good- looking boy, he was really very -- and he was a very good student, when he started to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Because after all he went already three years in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was from six to nine, and he was a very, very good student.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  So he went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and also to.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Yes, he went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and after <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> he went to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">From eight to twelve or one, we went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Then in the afternoon, from two on, I think we went to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And when the war broke out there was nothing left anymore, what else, there is nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Did he ever help on the work detail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work details. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And we lived together because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we moved in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where Leibush lived; so happens that this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was at. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we got the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we worked together, we lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He wasn’t, it wasn’t so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it’s written how he was released because only three Jews were released from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Leibush’s father is still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he had his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> because this was the place that he was not thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They had enough, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Until it was the transport to J and J to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belges</span> and then they were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  So they lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , that’s what they had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well, they had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was of two large <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a large <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so when we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we took over the large <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I say we, I mean my father, my mother, and I and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and he with his three children had the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , so we lived together what we used the same <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they had this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But he also had, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , he had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> still, there was not too much merchandise, but how much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  So he lived above the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  He lived above the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , yeah, and we lived in the same.....and he was lucky in this time that his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Like for us, they threw us out from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but he was there, so we came to live with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Now, if we wouldn’t live from him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But the main thing is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shulim</span> , also here you have written down 1945, Shulim was born the same year as Richard, my older brother’s son, but Richard was born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My brother had moved there after a pogrom in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I always think of these two, Richard now a doctor in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , Shulim killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at 13, not 13 but 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">See the people are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark down 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So he was born when he was 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So this, I think, this is a very nice sentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Shulim killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the age of twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is enough material.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Anything distinguishing about his mother that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She took care on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and Leibush took care on the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , but nothing special. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But maybe to mark down that Leibush survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That Leibush survived the war with me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and died in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of passports, the new ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well that is a very nice format, it looks very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The only thing it should be correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  No who do we go now? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">To

<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  This was after the German invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  After the German invasion, he was in the army, they drafted him, they drafted all the doctors and he was a reserve officer, being a doctor so they drafted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And then he was taken as a prisoner of war, and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> he started to run his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">When the Germans ordered the Jews should make a Judenrat, that means a Jewish council, and there was one Jew who right away volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">As the Germans came in he started to be an important man by the Germans, he started to come to the commandant and he started to tell them all kinds of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He was not a very person, this..... he started to tell them which Jews have hidden merchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Like he came to my -- the Germans liked coffee, coffee beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He came to my -- and we had coffee beans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Today he wanted two kilo, the next day three kilo and then four kilo....and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean we don’t have new shipments. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So he said well if you don’t want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and he squealed that my father has hidden merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They came over and they took away everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had because he squealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Not just coffee, everything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said that he ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , which later I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And he, and this man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So even there was here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> there are sayings if I speak to some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> and I ask them something and they don’t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I don’t want to mention his name because he has his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So they say, what do you think I am him? </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He was known that he is — for money he can be a witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn’t look Jewish, I mean he didn’t have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don’t want to be a politician, and I don’t want to have a job like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The Jews begged him, they told him, look if you don’t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that this man is no good for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Well, anyway, after a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I remember my father went to him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can pick out the people I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people, mostly people without beards, and that shouldn’t be, again, the Germans shouldn’t dislike them and also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They were people, respected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council which included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh , well younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He organized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> from their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He organized and made lists, and everything that had to be done was done through the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">If you want more details, in the book I have more details about Anderman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  So around July 41 he became the head of the Judenrat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He became head of the Judenrat in, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he became head of the Judenrat in the middle of ’40. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">In the middle of ’40, even earlier, I would say in spring of ’40, spring 1940, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they had to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you’Il see he was a very fair man, and I liked him very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Later he opened an <span class="BUILDING">ambulatorium</span> , a free <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don’t have money, so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty <span class="BUILDING">store</span> because he was in the flower business, and in the war they didn’t have flower, so he opened in his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> the ambulatori1um. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who was sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He needed help so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to teach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good as I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I went there and for this, because I was with him, this work released me from going to work on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> or something and I worked with him for over a year in this <span class="BUILDING">ambulatorium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  When did that open? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That <span class="BUILDING">ambulatorium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  This <span class="BUILDING">ambulatorium</span> opened in the middle of ’40, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And I worked with him with my friend, we........Then later more and more, I was more skilled, so a lot of things I could do, special with wounds and dressings and all those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  You saw Poles and Jews there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  No, no only Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">No Poles, they had their doctors there, he wasn’t allowed to treat Poles; the Germans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Then also he gave me a job, before the war I was the buyer for my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I used to go to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They needed somebody to bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> to the Jews, and this had to be, we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , like potatoes, they didn’t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened a <span class="INT_SPACE">public kitchen</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> in -- he organized a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> needed certain things that the Germans didn’t give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those things that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">By going out and having this pass, I also could buy a lot of <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> for the Jewish -- for the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> we needed, and also I bought on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> for myself, for my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I brought in stuff and they sold it so they could make something out of it, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So this was how we worked with Anderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was very fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Again in his book, you have the stories about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Then they organized the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they organized the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He built a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a year before the war, and this was the most exclusive, the most beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> very ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was a modern <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this was the only <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what had electricity and was the only <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who had indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">You see, he had a, not compressor, what you call it, to make electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  A generator?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  He had a generator and the generator produced enough electricity to take care on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> , with the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it had nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , so this the head of the county, the German who was very vicious, his name was Twardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And Twardon wanted to take over his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for himself because it was 1n a nice section. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So he urged Anderman to take over an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He said to him, you take, because you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Anderman said I will not pick out an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> until the last Jew has a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And if the Jews will be settled, then I will take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">See, he wanted to move in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , then later said to him, I want to move in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to renovate the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He said renovate it, it’s just a new <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it’s just a year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And besides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn’t live long in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the war will end and I will go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">See, he didn’t like these answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  That’s a very bold thing to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, well he didn’t like these answers, so on a certain day this was about, I would say about two weeks after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established, Twardon came and he arrested the whole Judenrat, everybody in the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Besides the Judenrat he also arrested about ten more people, and naturally for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was a very big shock they arrested, but Anderman was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Everybody said Anderman he’s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He went and spoke to this Twardon so two days later, or a day later he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Once he was arrested we felt that the situation was very grave because he was the only one who could --. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> about two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  So the whole Judenrat except him was arrested first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  First, yes, and then later he was arrested, two days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So, he -- now my brother was arrested, my brother-in-law wasn’t arrested, because my brother-in-law, I’m writing also in the book, there was before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established they took a certain amount of Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and they sent them away to have less Jews by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">He wasn’t there, so they didn’t arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now we were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders but then he said he’s looking for a new head of the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">While they were sitting in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , they were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi Rappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They had their business before the war that they used to send pigs to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katervitz</span> it’s a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , this was their business, so Anderman said....
QUESTION:  Pigs they sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yeah, this was their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They bought pigs, they sent them out, they slaughtered them, they sent the meat to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they had this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was a very unusual business for Jews but they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Anderman knew -- we knew that Twardon’s looking for a new but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , because in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> they lived in one big <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , it was not like a regular <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , but they kept them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">magistrate building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So Anderman said that if he would ask somebody to become the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">This way if everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">This maybe will force them to let out Anderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn’t listen to him and he told his wife to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Twardon</span> and tell him that her husband, this Pashik Rappaport is willing to become Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That he’s young, he’s energetic, he’s good looking and the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in K . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and they took out this Pashik and they saw that he --. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They take him away to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where the ___ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald __. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Anyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twardon he would be a good Judenrat man and he will serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and he made the president and his brother the assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Once this happened, Anderman said now we have lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We didn’t believe that a Jew would do it but he did and this man started to pick out members of the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Naturally he picked out different kinds of people that Anderman wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Anderman wanted the best quality and he picked out from the people that they were servant. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle business and a few black marketers. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He made a new Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Now the new Judenrat started to work and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Anderman could go out because, as a matter of fact, practically every night he went out to sleep in some <span class="BUILDING">Polish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">This was watched, this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was watched by the municipal police. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They knew him so they let him out and the next day before dawn he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The Polish people begged him not to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Eventually they would do something with those people, they will not keep them forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He didn’t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I am the one who can speak to the Germans for them; they listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He didn’t run away and then one day they came and they took all of them away to J . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They let out only three Jews, they let out, my brother included. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">If you read the book you will know the reason why. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">My brother-in-law came back from J. so Twardon said that there are some members of the first Judenrat, they should take them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They became in the second Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">J</span> about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">After two weeks they took all of them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and this time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was not so prominent as later. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and as they took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the families start to receive telegrams. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one died trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Let me flip the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1
QUESTION:  Very good, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Must be -- because I bought one, it’s not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">All right so there came the telegrams and always the telegrams had something to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They had to sign, somebody died, let’s say on lung cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Why they had to sign that he suffered from lung cancer a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Why they did it, why they make so evident a ------; somebody died on some other sickness, that he suffered from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Then a week after they received the telegrams and you could see the postman came in went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that right away you could hear the crying and the screaming so we knew that he comes with a telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">About two weeks later, the same people received bills from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with bills to pay for the cremation with some ashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They had to pay for the <span class="BUILDING">cremation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">This is how Anderman was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Meanwhile when he was arrested, his wife and son were left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> with non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and they lived this Aryan as Catholics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground when it was the Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw uprising, he was killed in the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">His wife survived and after a while she came over here an old broken woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">She died here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">For Anderman, when he was arrested so the Polish people, even the mayor who was in went to V and told them he should be released if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He says this is why we arrested him, he was too honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I think that this Anderman that what he did for the Jews that he never, never associated with the Jews, that he was an exceptional man. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I always say if the Jews would ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Because he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he was considered to be a Polish Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews because the Germans listen to me and they respect me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Do you think he just went a little too far with the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  He went a little too far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  He was a little too resistant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Well, he tried because he saw that they respected him so certain times he went a little too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He was not a person that we call it like a Jew-boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He always had his pride and for the Germans, he was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">If you read the book, you will see a lot of things that I gave examples of what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a little too much so he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  When you were part of the Polish army you were able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and you found those photos of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anderman</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Yeah, well I didn’t found it in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Later, a few years later, usually --. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">No, the photos of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anderman</span> I had because I save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">This is one photo, I think from the thirties and one what I had when he built the new <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was few years, a year before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Sitting outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  Sitting outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Then I got a photo of his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">His wife gave me the photo when she was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Now his photos from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , now usually the Germans didn’t make mug shots from prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They had millions and millions, I don’t know what they did, ; Now the people who were selected to be, to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">As you know, about 85% right away went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> ; about 15% they went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So the people who went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> didn’t get the tattoos. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Only the people who went to the right or to the left like they had the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But very few, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anderman</span> naturally was not -- all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> were not gassed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">This time, there were no transports to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">This was a camp where they took mostly Polish people were in the underground or were in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Jews who were called for one reason or another, like the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So they didn’t have selections; they were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> some a week, some, some were two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Because he was doctor, and because he was an important person, they made him mug shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">This is the first time I saw that somebody got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The mug shots that I got out about ten years later, about ten years from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anderman</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They kept Anderman, for this I have the number and the triangles because they have two kinds of triangles. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal or political, the Jews usually had two. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They had political and Jews so the triangle made like a myogen David. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one was the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So I got later from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  What was his, do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">What triangles did he have? </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Do you know the colors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Usually Jews had red and blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">One was political and one was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">On this, it’s black and one, so I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But this is probably what Jews had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Once he was deported, you never heard from him again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Once he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czechowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czechowice</span> about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">When he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czechowice</span> together with the other people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> ; this time they arrested not only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> they arrested in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from the section where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czechowice</span> was the head town. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We used to come to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> every week with packages for them because there was one of the guards that he could be bribed. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We gave him money and he took the packages with letters for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">If they arrived, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Because I had a pass to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I told you I went two, three times to buy, to bring the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We met in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there I met people from all other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Everybody did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They brought the packages and later this German, somebody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They took the packages, they got paid and he supposedly gave them the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But we never found out because he never brought back letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We send them letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">He could take the money, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I think once they came in, that they brought back letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">He was there about ten days or two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">After two weeks they send both to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , after a few weeks, I think after two weeks, the telegrams started to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Did you know what his said, his telegram?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  I don’t know because his telegram didn’t arrive because there was nobody to send a telegram.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Because his wife and son had left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  His wife disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They disappeared the day he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But the other people, the telegrams came and I saw the telegrams. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Mostly the telegram says that we want to let you know that your husband, this and this day, he died of cancer or he died on lung failure, TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">She had to sign that he suffered from TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Then some they were killed while trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But this was not --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  You suspect he was gassed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> versus being executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  No, they were all gassed, they were all gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But in the beginning, we don’t know because this was in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">This was towards --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  They were still building the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  They were still building it, so I don’t know if this were gas or executed, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I would suspect that there was one --. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> I don’t think were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on the commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There was a commission that studied the crimes for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I was a member of this commission which was headed by Hewlett Johnson (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He was the Dean of Canterbury. {</span><span class="sentence" id="458">You have photos of him, don’t you Norman?} </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Yes, I have photos of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The Archbishop of Canterbury and he was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The members of this commission were professors of <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There was an American, a Russian and I was sent from the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There were two delegates from the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I was one and the other one was, his name was Meega. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But his name was not Meega, he was a lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cracow</span> , his name was Dissenfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Later he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He was a lawyer before the war.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">ANSWER:  Well in January °40, it was the situation was the Germans started Jews to work and to harass Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But nobody knew and nobody thought that such a thing can be like extermination of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">They took Jews to work to forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I was with the Germans before I escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I was with the Germans for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">After when they occupied my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , then later I escaped to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">But when I came back the situation settled a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">The Jews had to work every day or they didn’t have the quota so they went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took out the Jews and they had to do all kinds of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">This was in winter so mostly the Jews were used to clean up the <span class="DLF">roads</span> from snow, they cleaned the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">But we knew the Germans were there but the Jews were still in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , they still had <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">It was just in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">QUESTION:  So, now what was Rozia doing during this time after her family left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">ANSWER:  After her family left she was with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Her mother was very sick so she was with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Now when I came back and her mother died and she was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">She was in this time 18 years old, so and uncle took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Because there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , the business was a family business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Like two uncles and her father, so they took her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">She was still in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but she ate by them and they took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Then she didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">By the Germans if they started to take people to work, usually Rozia was not taken to work because she lived not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , this was in the outskirts and the Germans didn’t go to catch Jews to work because they were mostly like Poles and they didn’t take the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">So they didn’t know if there are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So she actually didn’t go to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">QUESTION:  Her uncles did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">ANSWER:  Also no, because they were far away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Her, only had one uncle, his name was Kila Schmidt, he was an elderly man and he was a very, very intelligent man with a grey beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">He was taken from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Only when the Poles showed the Germans that there are Jews living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Because mostly they caught the Jews when it was a very concentration where the Jews were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So he was brought to work and they humiliated him because he was an elderly man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And I remember one time they put on him like a bottle on his back and he had to take water and carry it in the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">One time they took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they harnessed him to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> instead of the horse and he had to pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and there were a few German soldiers were sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they used to hit him that he should go faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">He was an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">So I remember a few times when the uncle was humiliated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  And her uncle, did he live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  No he lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Because they had two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which belonged to this <span class="BUILDING">flourmill</span> and the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite often, practically every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And if she needed something I took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And she lived there with the family ‘till June 1941, was established a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so she was taken with the family to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">They got two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she lived with the two uncles, the aunts with their children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">QUESTION:  You were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too, so when in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was a different system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">The Germans didn’t go out and grab people, Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to go to work, it was already organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they divided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">This way not the same Jews should be called every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">So when it came to Rozia’s time so she was notified and she went to work like other Jews went to work, cleaning <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> by Germans, cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , throwing away snow in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">She did all kinds of work the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">QUESTION:  Let me just check this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">ANSWER:  O,K. Then we lived like this in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then later I was taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">This was in January ’42 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I had a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so she had to go with me with my younger sister to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">But the day we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> in the very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature, so she didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I was operated, about two weeks later she came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , somehow she got a pass because you couldn’t travel by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you couldn’t go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">So she got a pass and she came to me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I think this was the most happiest day in this time that she arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1269">QUESTION:  You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">I wasn’t sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I was with an ear infection over four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Instead to take care, we didn’t have nobody to take care and it got worse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">I was practically dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">So with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> they took me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to , toa bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we came to and we came to , to a doctor, there was a specialist to an ear, nose and throat, Dr. Heller, and he said if I did not get an operation within two hours, three hours, I would be dead because the pus was already around my membrane, from the brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">So through, my brother went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and finally they bribed somebody and we got a pass to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kracow</span> , so two sisters went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> Poles wanted to throw me out from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">So they called the police and the police saw that we had legitimate passes, so the police said what do you want, they have legitimate passes because we got the passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">So the Poles said, nevertheless you have to throw them out because no Jews are allowed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So we begged them, the police, we begged the police, we begged the police to let us stay ‘till the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Not to throw us out from a running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">They said I am almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">So the police said O.K., so we sent to the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnov</span> , this was half way from us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kracow</span> and they took us down, they had to carry me to some friends, because I was almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and luckily in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnov</span> , there was a doctor, and his name was David Robinovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">He used to be the head of a very famous <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> but the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was and he was a specialist, ear, throat, nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So when they brought me over to him, he said he doesn’t think he can do anything to me, that it is too late because I was already with this ear infection for about four or five weeks and the pain was so that people cannot imagine how that pained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">So he said we have nothing what to lose we have to have an operation right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And he took him about six hours and he operated me and he said to my sisters, he said I made the operation but ninety-nine percent he wouldn’t wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And if he would even wake up all his mouth would be crooked or his eyes he wouldn’t see or his ears, because it was impossible because everything was already full with pus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Anyway when I woke up after eight days when he took off the bandages I can hear on this ear better than on the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">The eyes are good, the mouth is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">He was a genius that he made this operation, and then a few days later, Rozia came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">When she came naturally I was very happy and I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnov</span> , I was February, March, ‘till April 20 or April 12, 1942, because until he had to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Meanwhile she was with me all the time and then she had always trouble with her tonsils, so she complained so the doctor said once you are here he operated, he took out her tonsils. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Now he wanted money, but from Rozia he didn’t want a penny, because from me we had to pay him a lot of money for the operation and for Rozia he said he would do the operation without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So we asked him how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">He said well when you came and you started to tell me stories and your sisters, so I could get money out from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">With Rozia she had nobody, her mother died, her father, sister and brother were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , where would she have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">So I need people like you, they should pay me for people who cannot pay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">So I do operations for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So he operated on Rozia and took off her tonsils, she shouldn’t owe us because every few months he had infections in the tonsils and we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> both together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  So when was it you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  So we came back from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">When we came back, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was all together changed, we couldn’t recognize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">It was already so far, the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father, they shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and then later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Until June the 20" we were chased out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> , to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to and in ves
QUESTION:  How was Rozia’s family, all her uncles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1306">ANSWER:  All her uncles were alive, she was staying with her uncles, all her uncles were alive and when we were all chased out to this larger, she went with her uncles and we were in this larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from about June 20" ‘till July 7". </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">July 7“ they started <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Axias</span> , means transportation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , and with this first action, this was July the 7“, my family was taken and naturally Rozia with her uncles were taken the same day to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> and she perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I don’t know exactly the date, but 1t could be a day or two or three days the most after July the 7", But was mostly the trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> from us, took about five hours, and sometimes they had to wait in <span class="DLF">line</span> because there were so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> waiting, so they should be next exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">This was one of the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> that they didn’t have <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , they suffocated the people when they put them in hermetic closed <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> and they pumped in carbon monoxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">QUESTION:  From <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  From <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Not so much in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> as from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And then later when they choked to death which took quite a long time, it took about twenty to twenty-five minutes, they took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">They didn’t cremate the people in this time yet, because this was right in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">But they had very big <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Those <span class="DLF">ditches</span> were made because this was near the German/<span class="DLF">Russian border</span> , before 1941 when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> so they had anti-tank ditches so they filled up those <span class="DLF">ditches</span> with people and they covered them with sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Then later they took kerosene and they burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">So this is how she perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Did you lose track of her once you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  Well when they left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> for a few weeks, not a few weeks about two weeks, no I had contact with them same as with my family but when they took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> we didn’t know, so we hired a friendly Pole and the friendly Pole we sent him on the same <span class="DLF">track</span> that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went so it took him two weeks and he came back and through people he found out they were taken to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> and supposedly they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1321">QUESTION:  She was taken there, you weren’t taken there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">ANSWER:  I wasn’t taken because what happened is my family was taken there but when they were taken, so this man who was the head from the Gestapo in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> he organized a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">If you read, everything is in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">He organized a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> , and he brought back hundred young Jews and me he established in our <span class="BUILDING">house of prayers</span> or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">He established a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">And the reason he brought us back is because he wanted to destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto,</span> because they didn’t want to leave anything that was Jewish, so we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> every day went out and we destroyed <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And it’s exactly the description how the destruction went on in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Because we had to go together to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , but they took out hundred from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we went back and when we saw we had nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and this is how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Otherwise we would be taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> the same thing as all the people, because they accumulated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> about hundred thousand Jews from all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> who surround <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there 1s a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Now they told the Jews that they can take along with them anything they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything and later when they took them away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> all their stuff was left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the Germans had it in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1334">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1335">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and they later took it to their <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and the things that they needed they took away and the rest they gave to Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">The other thing I wanted to mention about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> , when we saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">You see I had a younger sister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">She spoke a few languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">QUESTION:  Was this Rachel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">ANSWER:  Rachel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should escape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pozna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1343"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pozna</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that it was next to the German Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">This was from <span class="DLF">western border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they opened a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the beginning of the war, and became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And they had a son a little older than I was, about five years older, and we became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So he begged my mother and Rachel, they would move away from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they would make believe that her son 1s a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to survive with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">When they told us this, we thought it’s a very good idea and then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">She had blue-greenish eyes and she had gold hair and she didn’t look at all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">So I told her, let’s make arrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them and we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">We’ll make false papers, it means that she’s married to this Pole and you will go away with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">We talked and talked and she somehow was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">She said, I cannot take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">I am afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I do not have guts to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">She said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So Rachel didn’t want to go because she didn’t want to leave the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And Rozia was afraid, she was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Maybe if she wouldn’t be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow leave the family and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established, they brought into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> Arbeits Amt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Arbeits Amt means a <span class="BUILDING">German labor office</span> to register all the working people and the head of it was a German, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could write German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">My sister spoke beautiful German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his secretary, and she worked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">They became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He liked her very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">She was a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , naturally this Arbeits Ant didn’t exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , somehow on the <span class="DLF">street</span> he met my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and I am now the head of the Arbeits Amt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and I need a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Why don’t you become again my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">So she said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">My father was already shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">He said well I can only save you not the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">So she didn’t want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was a curse for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run away, or do something, but they wouldn’t do it because they didn’t want to leave their families, their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">So this time she didn’t want to go away if he wouldn’t give the permit to them to be left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">So we’re talking about, we went away a little from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> , but this is how she perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">QUESTION:  How did you find out about Rozia’s family in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1378">ANSWER:  Well when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , when I escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I knew that they are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> everybody from each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> knew about somebody else who was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">So we got acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">QUESTION:  And later, after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1383">ANSWER:  After the war they were in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and during the war before <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> they used to send cards to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">So we answered them a letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">Then after the liberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> and they wanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in because they were released from the . </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And they wrote a letter, so I got the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I wasn’t in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> , and somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> who received this card brought it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">I was already in this time in the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">So they brought me the card what they wrote to Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">So I had their address, so I wrote them the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And I remember the first letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I told them that from the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> only nine people survived and I told them who and I told them that Rozia didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And since then we were in contact with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">When they came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , so they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but in this time when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I was already out I escaped before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">And we were in contact then the family went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , we were in contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">The brother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santo Domingo</span> , from Santo Domingo he came over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">In the beginning I had a business so somehow I managed to take him in the business and he lives here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">He got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">My wife was the matchmaker when He got married because his wife was a Hebrew teacher together with my wife and when he came over he couldn’t stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">If he wouldn’t be married to an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And because she was a Hebrew teacher, they got married and this way he could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Now they have two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">QUESTION:  The rest of Rozia’s family went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  Went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">The father went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he died there and the sister with her husband and her two children, so they are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">They are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And this is how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">It’s the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1409">QUESTION:  I’m thinking in terms of the ID cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">If you can remember something about Rozia, the story about her before the war, about ’35 to °39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">ANSWER:  Well, from ’35 to ’39 the only story I can remember is that, because I was not in contact with her, because I couldn’t speak to her, I was a Hassidic boy and we had nothing in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I remember she had an uncle and the uncle used to go every Friday to the <span class="INT_SPACE">steam bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">He was an elderly man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">This was the man who the German, he was always sitting, he could not go down for cold water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">steam bath</span> , so I was near him and every time he needed a bucket with cold water, I used to bring it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Not so much that I liked him, but I figured this would bring me closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">Also he used to tell stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">He was a philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">So sometimes he caught me with my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Nobody wanted to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">I always was standing there listening to him because again the same stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">But special about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozia</span> , yes, also this may be interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I started to see Rozia, we joined the Hanoar Hotzioni, this 1s a youth, Israeli Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my sister Rachel, was the head of this group in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then later when I wasn’t anymore Hassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And we got together and we sang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my happiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">So that’s all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1426">QUESTION:  How long did she belong to the youth movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1427">ANSWER:  To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">I would say ’38 and half ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And then the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">Then in 1939 I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but I couldn’t so I made contact to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">You paid in 500 zlotys and they took you to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , illegal on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">So I remember with a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn’t have the money so I remember his mother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">We sent in the money and we waited any day to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">We got letters and then we didn’t go because the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> the first thing I would see to make arrangements for Rozia to come over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1436">QUESTION:  She wanted to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">ANSWER:  She wanted to go, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Well this was everything quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I didn’t tell it to my family, she didn’t tell it to her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">But between us we made plans to go and to settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Also, in the beginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody wants to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And this was during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">You had to send in so much money to be registered but you had to have blood relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel, registered and I registered with Rozia and I registered that we were married, because we said in case this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So we sent in some money and later we didn’t hear anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">So my sister, Rachel, had a Chusen (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">so he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">She could come before but she waited for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Listen, you only need half a page, but I don’t know what you would pick out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1450">QUESTION:  I think that’s fine and I'll call you if I have questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">ANSWER:  All right, if you have it, or you can send me a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1453">ANSWER:  You can send me a copy by normal mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">You can send it and I will correct it or something and then later I will correct it and I’Il send it back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1455">QUESTION:  Now, I just want to ask one or two more things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">Maybe you can describe to me where Rozia lived, maybe the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she lived in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1457">ANSWER:  O.K. They lived, mostly Jews lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Mostly Jews lived around the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> all <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Only four <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> , which was very big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not rich, were very poor lived around the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">They were small crooked <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , old <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> falling down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And they lived there and they had two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">Three families had two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">There was a brother and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Her mother had a sister and a brother and they were all in the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">In the business before the war and they lived in those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">They were nice <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">It’s not comparison like we have in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">But the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were nice with beautiful <span class="DLF">gardens</span> with flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was Mrs. Smith, she was very particular in her <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">She always worked, with beautiful flowers and every time there was a <span class="DLF">concourse</span> , it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest, her flowers were the nicest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">She didn’t have children so she had the flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">So they lived there, like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">The only thing they had more than we in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we didn’t have electricity, they had electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">The reason why is because they had electricity from the <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> because they had there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">So for us it was something important because when we come we saw electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">They had very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , very nicely furnished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">But for our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> fairly successful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1482">ANSWER:  It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the °30’s it was a fire, there was a big fire in the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build themselves up as it was before the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small <span class="BUILDING">lumber mill</span> , it was not big. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">It wasn’t that they manufactured to send out for export like other <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> , it was mostly for domestic use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain but it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">But it was a very prominent family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">They were a little more modern than the majority people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">The majority people were very orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia’s sister and brother already went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasia</span> , my sisters didn’t go because my father would never allow us to go on a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">Rozia didn’t go anymore to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasia</span> but her brothers went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">The reason Rozia didn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasia</span> because this was after the fire and probably this was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> , and probably it was too expensive for them to send Rozia to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">So instead of the gymnasia, so after she finished the she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1492">QUESTION:  The seamstress worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or next door to her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1493">ANSWER:  Well, not far from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">There was a seamstress, she was special, a very elegant seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kollupzowa</span> originally and later she moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and she had a workshop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .. Later she came back when Hitler started to, when Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because her husband was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">His name was Rosner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">So her husband was Jewish and she wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">But anyway because when they started with all the laws in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , so she figured she didn’t want to wait so she came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">The woman by whom she worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">So see I know all those stories, I don’t know what else I can tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1501">QUESTION:  I think that’s good.. So they were sewing like dresses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1502">ANSWER:  Well, mostly they were sewing to order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but they didn’t sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Not the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but somebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Because her being already having already a workshop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , she was a little more sophisticated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">She did all her dresses herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , so she left all her clothing with her because they wouldn’t take away, so later she fixed them over to fit for Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what her sister left in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1510">QUESTION:  So in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> she had things from her family to sell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1511">ANSWER:  She had things from her family to sell, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">With her uncle who didn’t have no children and how they lived, they lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">I know I used to travel a lot and I used to go out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I took off always my armband, because I didn’t look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">So every time they needed something, so I brought it for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">This is how we went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">If the Germans wouldn’t have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">You see Rozia had the big chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">Because her language actually was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">They didn’t speak home Yiddish like the majority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">The majority Jews did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">Like for instance, in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with the non-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who spoke beautiful Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">But the majority people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> didn’t speak good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">But Rozia’s family spoke only Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1527">QUESTION:  Did Rozia speak Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">ANSWER:  Very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my father, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">She spoke very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">She spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">Everybody by us in our <span class="REGION">section</span> spoke German because our <span class="REGION">section</span> was <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> and this belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> until the end of the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">So everybody spoke Polish, I mean German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">But Yiddish, she didn’t speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">She understood, but..
QUESTION:  So when you two spoke it was in Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1536">ANSWER:  It was in Polish, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And I remember even when she came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so my sisters, my mother spoke to her in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">And late when she came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn’t get in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , salami, a piece of cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">All I remember my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> sent through turkey, a package with chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn’t get in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I would divide it for all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">She said it was for her, she got also a part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">I remember it was Rozia’s birthday and I wanted to give her a present and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful manicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to me I should give it to Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin, and she said give it to Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn’t give it to you because this gift didn’t work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to Rozia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted something it was all right with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">See her family was different from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">My family was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">So this was a little bad, but later 1t didn’t make no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">It so happens that her brother, now in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , he’s very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">He goes every day to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">I don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I go once a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">You know, it changed those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">You don’t always have the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1556">QUESTION:  Well, that’s it. </span>
