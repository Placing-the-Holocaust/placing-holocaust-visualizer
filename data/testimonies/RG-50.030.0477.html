<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Tell me your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My formal name is Charles Siegman, my birth name is Charlie Sigmann, or Jechiel Sigmann, I was born Jechiel, the Hebrew name, and that itself is a introduction to where I come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">People always ask, how does a good Jewish boy get the name Charlie from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And the story is that my father had to register me. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , all children had to be registered by an official roster of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And when my father came, he asked what’s child’s name, he answered Chiel, which was the shortened name for Jechiel. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And Chiel was not on the list of names, and he had to choose an official name. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So the first Ch was Charlie. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That was a Dutch name, and so my name became Charlie. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they changed it to Charles, because Charlie looked like a child name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  But [indecipherable] re-registered or became a citizen, I finally made it to Charles Jechiel Siegman, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And were you called Jechiel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes, Chiel, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Chiel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Chiel, or Jechiel [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  October 13", 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  And you were born where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  In a little suburb town of The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> called Scheveningen, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing town</span> , but it was a really an adjunct town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , and eventually my parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  So -- but it was a little -- known for its fishing fleet, in fact, and in the war, the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the Germans couldn’t pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S- Shravening -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shaveningen</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing fleet</span> , in fact, and in the war, the name Scheveningen was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the Germans couldn’t pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S- Shravening -- Shaveningen. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, German soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you’re, you know, friend or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So that’s the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , anyway, it’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Sin -- since you were such a young person during this period, having been born in 1935, it would be good if we could try to distinguish between what you actually remember, when we talk about the experiences, and what you were -- what you were told, so we can get an idea what your memory is versus what you’re remembering from other people’s, if you think we can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Difficult to identify every --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes, no, no, I understand, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  -- part of the element. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">This definitely is a blend, what I recall now, or I relate now, is a blend of what I recall -- what I think I recall --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  [indecipherable], as -- what I’ve heard, which I have seen confirmed, in fact, what I have- things have re -- recors -- subsequently confirmed in writing, so I guess I attributed it to my recall as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And what I’ve read, and heard, and talked with my brother and sister, or others. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But as I’ve mentioned to you, otherwise, my recall is spotty, and more in the sense of mental imprints, like [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my mind to this day I could see certain pictures, and I don’t have a running --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  -- [indecipherable] a commentary, nor the chronology thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Right. [</span><span class="sentence" id="37">indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Definitely months, or periods which I have no idea what happened when, or whether anything happened at all in a three month period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  But I know episodes, and episodes kind of tell my story in the context of the Holocaust, or Shoah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Let’s get a sense of your -- your family before we get into your particular tale.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Who was your dad, and what did he do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Przemysl</span> , established Jewish little community, and he moved to western Europe, I believe first to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in the 20’s, before he was married, in fact.[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee coming from eastern Europe, or from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> , I believe first to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20’s, before he was married, in fact.[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee coming from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , or from Germany to Holland, lived there for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He was not a citizen ever, he was stateless, he was Polish nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> he was called stateless, but Polish nationality, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My mother came originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zborow</span> , which people think wer -- was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , could be <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , cause the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> this -- have shifted management over time, and was raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">At a very young age she moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Her parents were -- grandparents, parents were one of the early settlers of the east European families who moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Again, that family, that group of families, I was told, could not move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , didn’t have the right to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , they moved outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , to -- they had a lot of restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my parents were married in the early 20’s -- in ’22, and the wedding had to be held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , because a large number of members of the family couldn’t receive visas to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , where the -- typically, the bride’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family town</span> would be the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I have the wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That also has a Shoah story about it in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But anyhow, my father lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and he was a postage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp store, had a wholesaler type of business, and had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and lived origin -- he originally lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with my older brothers were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and then moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> , and he had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> <span class="BUILDING">postage stamp store</span> , had a wholesaler type of business, and had the store and lived origin -- he originally lived in Amsterdam with my older brothers were born in Amsterdam, and then moved to Scheveningen, and he had a store in one of the main streets. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So he was a middle class person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a Socialist, not a pervert, or what have you, and belonged to the east European community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Ca-Can you explain what it means to own a <span class="BUILDING">postage store</span> , that’s not stamp collecting, or is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yes, stamp -- no, stamp collecting, postage stamps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Ah, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many more small <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in Europe, to this day there are more than United States, who -- that specialized in particular items, so there -- now, also there are few postage stamp stores in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> <span class="BUILDING">postage stamp stores</span> in the United States, most probably have s -- some Bethesda. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But that was the job, to collect stamps from the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and organize them by <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and know the dates, and the value, and they sell them to dealers, or to customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, postage stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He had his own, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave over to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don’t know exactly who, before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It never returned after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollection of going into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No, no, no, not at all, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I -- but I do know that he dealt with postage stamps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh -- but I-I see them around, I mean postage stamps were very popular, much more than today --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So you recall in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> seeing the postage stamps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  I saw, yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  And did your mother work as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  No, I believe she was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as far as I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And we -- as -- we are a family of five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I was the youngest, born in ’35, and my sister in ’?</span><span class="sentence" id="77">33, and my brother in ’31.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  So ma -- so Leah is born in ’33?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Y-Yes, °33 --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And Leo 1s born --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- Leo was born in ’31, and my two other brothers who were killed during the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they were born in ’26, and ’24.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So that’s Aron --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Ah -- yo -- jos -- Josef --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Jos -- Josef?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- Erik, was born in 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So they were substantially older than I wa-was. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">As a child there’s a big difference, obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So during this period before the war, between -- before the war comes to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , between °35 and ’40, what is your memory of that <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain activities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> was a resort town, so there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it’s still a resort town, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> , and -- so it was an active <span class="BUILDING">household</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> , so there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it’s still a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> , the beach, and -- so it was an active household. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I don’t know much about the social life of my family, so I can’t relate to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal incidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also the interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I was actually was saved, kind of -- that’s all I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The first one was I was lost in the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So the family went to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , that’s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity, it was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that’s not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And the police picked me up, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman’s lap, with a policeman’s cap on my head, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was found, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That was what -- what -- what do we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Second episode which I recall, was I took a walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a shortcut through a <span class="DLF">park</span> , and was hit by a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swing</span> , that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span> were wood, and I was apparently unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I had a sort of a scar right over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They tell me that had it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter below, I’d have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I had stitches. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Those days you had stitches with like staples, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I remember the gift coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> , back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but they kind of illustrate I’d led a child’s normal, quotation mark, child’s life in a home environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Do you remember your parents at tha -- 1-1-1n that period when you were [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, again, I remember them as, y -- know, se -- senior adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I was the baby of the family, and I don’t remember any story or event that kind of left a mark with me, but I knew my -- my mother was a housewife, and remember cleaning the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and taking care of the household events. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The hou -- I mean, the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , as far as I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We had a lot of visitors, I do recall people coming by, and we confirmed -- subsequently I met certain people, relatives [indecipherable] I visited when I was a little child with my parents, and down the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Was it a <span class="BUILDING">religious household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes, was a <span class="BUILDING">religious household</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  It was re -- we were raised -- ra-raised as observant Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="110"><span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- attending --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was that unusual in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  -- not so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Not really, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">First of all, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> has two or three communities, the more -- can’t say native, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They had their own <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , and own community. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Then there were the east European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But in Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My parents were fully observant, a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , and active in Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what later became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of have memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">All I really remember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall boys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were rolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But they were kind of active in youth organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So it wasn’t, again, in the broader sense, that description were a normal family, as people would have liked to live, and were not allowed to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  D-Do you recall your little friends that you had during that period [indecipherable] family and your --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I do not recall friends at all --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  -- in fact, I mean, in part because we had a sizeable family and had two children -- my bro -- siblings were close enough in age, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I do not recall from before the war, anyone by name, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That’s a -- whether I had it, I just don’t know, I mean, never discussed that with my brother or sister at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you go to a nur -- was there something [indecipherable] to a nursery school, or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I do recall starting <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I do recall starting school in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I was only half a year in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We went to what’s called then a <span class="BUILDING">public Jewish school</span> , it could -- what’s called nowadays day schools, most probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They were Jewish schools, and this was bef -- my brother went before that -- I had to go, cause at the time already when I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , and this was bef -- my brother went before that -- I had to go, cause at the time already when I was going to school, I had to be enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , it wouldn’t -- now the Nazis did not allow --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So that was late already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Late already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  But I do remember for going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and in kind of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , singing, playing, and I was supposed to be a good boy, called in Dutch, witte boontje -- bon -- boontje, that was a white bean, that’s description of being in -- a goody-goody boy, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> period was a very tense period. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">People -- there was all kinds of talk going on already around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , murmurings. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What it meant, I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I knew that something was brewing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  This is in °42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  That was °42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  But you didn’t know what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, but there was something unusual, was nothing -- it was like something was involving- and I sensed, I di -- I do recall sensing -- to the school year was both disrupted obviously, I was -- it couldn’t last very long, several months only, but 1t was not a normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experience, because the people in the classes were eventually in doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">People came, and people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I si -- this I -- this I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not -- not that I had been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for many years, so as what I did go to a <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> , I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But it was not a stable environment, and this I had sensed right away, both at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , where there were murmurings, and most [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst themselves something, you know, something that’s serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">What exactly it was, I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Was as bes -- I -- and was probably children brought into discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And of course I was too young, because I was a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Do you have a recollection of 1940, when the Nazis occupied?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">No, no, no.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  And do you think that the same protection and feeling of being -- you’re pretty safe, was true for your -- for Leo, and Leah --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I don’t know how far hi -- how hi-high it would went, right, then because an -- a -- a child in general is left out for these sort of discussions, and the youngest, I was a young child, was not -- was not a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I was -- I was almost six and a half, seven, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So I was [indecipherable] a party to these discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I don’t really know how much my brother -- my brother I think even more.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  But I had very little ongoing contact with my older brothers, except as being older brothers, but not on a playing se-sense, and I don’t even recall which grade they were -- they were, you know, adults, and they were adults already. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">By 1942 my oldest brother was -- ’24 to °42 -- ah -- was 18 years old, and [indecipherable] was 16.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  They were much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So the contact between a seven year old, and a 18 or a 16 year old are --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Before -- no, before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , I was -- we were already -- our family was split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">In -- in November, December, I think, our family started splitting up.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] ’42 now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  So [indecipherable] say it was -- that’s why th -- you say whether or not I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was [indecipherable] issue, cause by ’42, in the fall of ’42, later developments with Dutch Jewry oc-occurred already, deportations, shipments, round-ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We were not last, but we were not first, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Okay, so --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation, and what wa -- was happening -- what happened was that my mother and two older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and Josef, they went to one <span class="NPIP">location</span> , my sister to another, and my brother and myself to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And bro -- those <span class="NPIP">locations</span> were strange in retrospect, but made sense at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There was a notion that certain people are less likely to be rounded up, or perhaps even immune, exempt. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So if you stay, even with Jewish families that have that character about them, you are protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So the notion was that my mother and her brothers, who were of working age, they were put into a -- a <span class="BUILDING">mental asylum</span> , because the thought was that they don’t need -- they’re not going to be prom -- people at -- either accepted or believed the case that there were the people being shipped for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So, they’re not going to take people who have mental problems, they’I] leave them alone, spend your energies elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My sister was placed in another type of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and initially with, I believe in her case, a pregnant woman, who again they thought wouldn’t be taken, or a woman who had just given birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That was sort of conventional wisdom at that time, and so we were separated from our parent, and the parent itself -- my father stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Your father at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , your mother in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where is the [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my two older brothers in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my sister in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my brother and I in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  And where were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  With my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  No, I know that, but --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  To -- to this family, I think to -- to a woman had just given birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  And what were you told about -- I mean, it’s very odd for a little child to be separated like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Yes, Ill see you later, you know, we’ll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Now, what is interesting 1s that people had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my father stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> apparently, was to kind of settle affairs, his belongings, and who knows what, and come -- and contact with family outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I believe, which eventually materialized somewhat for that, and to make arrangements for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So, not clear whether our arrangements were temporary or permanent. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">My parents were the ones who were making those decisions, and I was obviously not privy to those at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure, things were different, but whether it’s permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And my brother was there, so maybe that acted as a sense of stability for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And the days went. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There also was a conventional wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on fact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So in the morning, my father, he went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> too, we met my father every morning at <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So that respect, things were normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So we met, and he patted me, chatted me, kissed me or s -- what, and it was a daily event. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And my last image of my father is sitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next day I came he wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So then we knew that he was deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  And you knew that, or you knew something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  We knew something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  You knew something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Right, yeah, my brother and I knew something, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And this is 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  "42, December ’42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  December ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So right at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  That’s end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  So you are staying with this -- in this family [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Family, right, now that didn’t last --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  -- not di -- no, not -- not two, three months, not -- very short period. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That family sofe either couldn’t keep us, or what have you, and we were put all three of us in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Because again, the view was that the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> is a safe haven. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They aren’t going to take little children, little orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And meanwhile my mother and two brothers were rounded up, my father was rounded up and they move -- they were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> in the end of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Of °43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  "43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  And middle of January they were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and killed there three days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We were rounded up a little later, in February, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  In -- in February.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  They were sent out of west -- out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> on the 18" of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  Huh, and -- and when did you find that out, that wh -- that was the transport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Well, through the red -- subsequently, in recent years, I’ve tried to trace down through the Red Cross, that -- curious to find out what --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  -- formally happened, any documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Took a long time, oddly enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It’s very strange that the record keeping was so uneven. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">After the war -- I mean, now moving --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And in our case, we were more or less told by relatives and others, that our parents were deported and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and that was the als -- we had no documentation for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I tried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we don’t know when, where. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document confirmation. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In year 2001", I got a Red Cross notification with documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Now, it turns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a sort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send us a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that it was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that it is available. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and departure dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">A long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And in fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of deceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So -- you may be aware that the rabbinate in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> selected one date of the year for those people that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And they selected the 10 of Tevet, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So the f -- took us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15" of Shavuot, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And did Westerbork have deportation lists, or they didn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Did they have -- I -- yeah, I’m sure they had, but -- there’s just what happened after the war, a lot of people made confusion, a lot of people made efforts, di -- they hit a <span class="DLF">roadblock</span> , and they kind of called it quits, or so, and nobody came notifying us. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I mean, this is a problem, it’s a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn’t know us, and we didn’t know who knew, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So you ask me how do I know the dates, now it’s in black and white and confirmed, and it’s from lists -- a big list in the Dutch registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I have a copy of the registry here with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Now, did your mother arrange for the three of you to go to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Do you kno -- do you know how that was arranged at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  I believe it was probably through my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- in beginning of January, I believe, the first week or so, and then they were -- must have been a week or so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and so we were -- was probably more through my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">The -- these -- there were a lot of ad hoc arrangements during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Some were planned, and some were, you know, you had to improvise, and as -- when one option kind of reached it’s end of contini -- continue, like me being in these private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , where people thought was safe, they found a next tier. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So we lasted another month in these different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , compared to my parents and my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then you ask me, you know, did I know what was happening to me, the answer is no. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I was, know, placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I was with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I was most probably being fed, and taken care of, and that took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I did know that 1 -- used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the morning, routine, that stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And my brother knew more, he knew that -- what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That once he didn’t see us, that he’d been dep -- rounded up and being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So it must have --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And he -- he didn’t tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Do you remember -- any recollection?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  But again, you can keep in mind, if you rec -- reconstruct, if you’re among a lot of children, suddenly, you are busy, you play, you eat, and you’re taken care of, and you start forgetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It’s like, you know, little children with babysitters, when the mother’s -- parents go on vacation, may cry beginning, and subsequently settle down, and -- not that it was so nor -- I’m -- not that it was all shipped away. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I don’t recall being shipped away. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But that was circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  And not my older brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So definitely I must have sensed things were different, but whether that is permanent, or whether that is dangerous, or [indecipherable] I don’t think a child could catch it immediately, because nothing terrible was happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I wasn’t being beaten up, or on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or something of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So I mean, I was under somebody’s supervision and auspices, and that’s how I -- I took it, I suppose.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  But again, based on this assumption, that certain categories of people are going to be bypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">People’s friends and relatives were being picked up, and people swen- started going into hiding, or escaping, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Some tried to make provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or our children be safe? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if some people can’t make it, other could make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And very often, you can’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for seven people, you can have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So you had to split up on practical grounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime orsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But di -- bottom line was, you know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then separated from my brothers and mother, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And I was with my little -- older brother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And then I followed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I moved along with the -- the flow.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  It was probably as -- out -- they didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , 1t was probably in the outskirt, someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And -- but the round-ups don’t -- they took the collected people and assembled them, and they brought them all to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">That was the collection point. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And then f --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  I remember the -- being in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and people scurrying back and forth from the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">In fact, one of my relatives was one of -- see the -- they had a -- the council of Jewish -- Jewish council had to do a lot of the paperwork for the round-ups, both identify and do the works. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I do recall people scurrying in front of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and mut -- this relative of mine who I knew, waving to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I could see it now, I mean -- and then we were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">That was the next stop, the next movement, in February, sometime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  February °43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  43. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Turns out that had we arrived under normal circumstances, we -- they had a procedure in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> when people arrived, the next Tuesday, or the following one, people were picked -- designated to go to the next <span class="NPIP">stop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">That time, ’43, the destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">One after the other, every week or two, there was a trainload --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  On Tuesdays, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  On Tuesday, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , we would have designated to go the next shipment, but - like everybody else, it wasn’t exceptional. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It turned out our good fortune was there was a scarlet fever epidemic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , a certain <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , so they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in quarantine, they wanted to protect the German soldiers, they don’t want to get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So this int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">That week was critical for us, because while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork authorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents from our family in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine visas were made available for us and our parents and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Unfortunately for them it came too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But that week of <span class="DLF">window</span> saved us, because then we put in different category of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a little separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because they wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it put us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category, and we were put into different grouping. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But without that week of scarlet fever, I wouldn’t be talking to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  You would have been sent immediately on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, we -- the norm -- right. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The reason why -- we wouldn’t be any different than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">That was the pattern, people came, and left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Now, did you know, cause you’re now a little bit older, you’re eight --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Or seven and a half? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Were you told -- this scarlet fever quarantine --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We were -- no, n-no, we were told --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  No, but we -- I was told about the papers, something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  You were told that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The other thing which I was told, I -- again, is our parents, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> send a postcard. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That was very standard to drop postcards, and if they were lucky, other citizens would pick it up and put it into the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And was given to my brother, he -- my brother became the oldest person of the family, and I was told my brother had had a postcard from my parents, from what -- what it meant, I didn’t know, but it was now wishing us well, take care, and in fact gave us the name of a relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> if you need help. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And at the end of the postcard our brothers wrote in Hebrew [indecipherable] see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So I -- this I recall, my brother telling me walking somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and telling pos -- not that -- I don’t know, he tells more later, but the -- that we got a postcard from our parents on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , wherever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Whatever that meant for me, I don’t know how to re-interpret it, but that little bit of information was given to us, but then we put into a new category of people -- not that we knew that we were different there [indecipherable] cause we didn’t have the sense of this timetable which we know now. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">People didn’t know, necessarily --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  -- that -- came very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Now, moving people arrived, stayed, were registered, and then they were shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  How do you picture <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Small <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , little wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I recall, and we were put under the guidance of a S-s -- <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> equivalent, a per -- one family was designated to take care of children who were separated from their parents, or lost their parents, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And we put in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> apparently, and that was his task. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He had a number of children as well, so I became friendly with his child, or he’d like me to play with his child, so I hung around his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> more than the standard <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> most of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I kind of took care of us, collectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But that status helped us, because we not put on lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">There is one episode my brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">They didn’t always trust those documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do you know about <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So he was called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And he was told that his mother’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to kind of confirm it, the source came -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">She was Swiss born, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Was -- lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that he was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how’d you get these things? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My mother’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And they accepted, asked what -- where’s your father, and he didn’t -- wasn’t given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered, he’s dead, and they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps where our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it wasn’t -- we weren’t really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports were not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So we spent the year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> among children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  So you lived in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  Lived in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with children, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Do you remember the food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Was as -- Iremember a little more the food about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  -- than the food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , but there was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I was, I think, not preoccupied with no -- being, again with -- in a group of children, that -- wa -- which probably helped me in various stages, that eventually yeah, you played, and you spend your time, and wha -- wa-was fed, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">My brother was a little more advanced, so he most probably had to kind of keep his ears out what’s happening, and he was therefore more perceptive. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But I was not drawn into that orbit at that stage of the game.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Did you notice children coming and going --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Coming and go -- yes, yes, yes, yes, I noticed that there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  But that didn’t necessarily affect you, because --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, because I was there, you see, and as long as I stayed next morning there -- I didn’t -- I mean, it’s -- again, under the circumstances, my age, had no reason for me to think about the instability of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I mean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know, look what happened, were you scared, were you -- there’s no -- no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I mean, the saving feature was that I hung around with children, cause I was a child, and I was placed with -- in a <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> , effectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He was the guardian of a number of children, lots of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birnbaum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birnbaum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And I was even better off, I was put in close contact with his own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So I was playing and maybe eating at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , who knows what? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">There were family units 1n these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> situations, so that kept a little sense of normalcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Not having my parents somehow did not hit me during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  Was there something like a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Did you have classes at some point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  They have both there and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , they had little groups of study groups to keep people entertained and educated a little bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject matter, holidays, songs, and both -- some songs, in fact I do recall the music to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Wh- What -- what do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom, with the prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was a round. [</span><span class="sentence" id="462">sings a few lines]. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we sang that, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And another one, Shomer Yisrael. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Now, they’re interesting in retrospect, those two songs, which also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , the -- exactly the same songs were taught, I recall, is quite remarkable, because both of them are the prayers of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We didn’t know the translation as much, but the teachers kind of were injecting hope on this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , peace on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So, those two songs I remember to this day, but I didn’t have -- it turns out that -- that people used to sing them subsequently too, so I don’t know what I would --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Sing a little bit of the second song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It was a choir rounding song, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And -- so we had instructions, we had learning in both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> and ams -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> I remember more concreteness that I know the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> where we went up, the third floor of the caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of the caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] floor, had three layers. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We went up, and we did our little studying, whatever it had to study, you know, instruction, the stories, holidays, about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And there was a watchman in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> watching, because we’re not allowed to have formal classes, and the watchman in [indecipherable] I remember the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their equivalent came by to inspect the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we got the warning, and we started playing cards, or games, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Very, very similar to the story about Chanukah, where people -- one reason why people played dreidl, because they -- because at that time also, people were prohibited to study the Torah, and with guards coming by, and then people improvised games.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  And so we went through that in 1943 and ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">But there was instruction, but not formal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Could you read? </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Did you have some instruction [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I had some instruction, well I had very little formal education --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  -- with three months or so, at best, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I -- yes, I learned how to read, maybe even before at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I don’t recall where. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But I remember I read Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  And my vocabulary obviously was limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Was -- didn’t develop, I didn’t have more -- I spoke Dutch among the Dutch people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , obviously Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But I didn’t read books in the normal sense of the term. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But there was instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">People spent again, their time. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They devot -- there were former teachers who were idle, so they had some to do, and people took on responsibility to keep the kids occupied, and study with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So that was familiar things, but not when it came back after the war I had handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  I didn’t have the same background as other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  I -- I read that the weather in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Do you have any recollection if that’s true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, the weather was raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Dutch weather is not, you know, the most comfortable weather except in the spr -- summertime or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It’s a variation of British weather, wet, cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it was ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don’t recall how we survived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , which is even colder, because we didn’t come with, you know, baggage of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Must have had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Now, I may have taken my brother’s clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Now, we didn’t grow that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So the question mark still is, where did we get our clothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We may have gotten it from other people who left, and the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> may well have supplied us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But we didn’t certainly have our own wardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So every so often I do reflect, how did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our own clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But I -- I sp -- I assume that these people like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> the woman who took care of us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure the children under their charge have clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And where they got it from was probably from people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So I don’t know how bitter the cold was for me personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But it -- I do know it was drab.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Were you also limited where you could walk? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Could you just stay around where this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I had no reason to parade in the large <span class="REGION">areas</span> like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this Birnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , in the morning go to the <span class="BUILDING">Birnbaum’s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So that was my routine, so no reason for me to wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no need for me to wander around. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So that respect, being young was a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  And were you required to have a Jewish star on your clothes as well, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  You did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But that did not necessarily, you know, impact me dramatically because that we had -- that [indecipherable] was on my sweater, and I wa -- it was cold you wore a sweater, you wore that with the yode star on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So again, in looking back on it, being a sm-small child, or a very young aged little boy protected me, gave me my own little area of protection, that I did not face a lot of the other things which I would have faced four years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  My brother had more exposure, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , because as you move up the ladder of age, you get -- you’re drawn into these other restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So I can’t say that I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today’s environment most probably wouldn’t feel restricted if they cannot cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">You know, if you ask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don’t think they would express it in these terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  That makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We’re going to have to change the tape right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">End of Tape #2 Tape #3</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Is there anything else that you would remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> before you get sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that could mention -- that I have mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I [indecipherable] come back subsequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Right, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  No, I think that’s -- the time passed, and then we were --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Now, you’re a year --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  A year, we --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  -- from what, February --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  February to February.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  -- fe -- February.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  So in February ’44 --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  “44</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Now, does somebody come and tell you tomorrow you’re going to go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I mean, how --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Not to me, Leo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  Not to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Not to me, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I was -- I don’t feel bad being left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">No, but we were told that ending up in west -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> -- see, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt-stadt</span> , as you know, was a place where they -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Primarily people who had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and therefore <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was a place to -- transits, <span class="NPIP">spot</span> to get people out, and so we were there in some sense too long, we didn’t belong in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> because we’re not transit people, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of privileged people. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But -- so I had no sense that that’s a new regime, you know, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But my brother and sister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my brother and sister with me on an ongoing basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That was my anchor of family stability, and the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So when I was -- when we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , we were put under the auspices of a social worker from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka Weinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under their responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And we ended up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which again I do remember the physical feature of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , 1t was a compar -- a European compartment train, was probably third class, but it was not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">European compartment train</span> , was probably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were subjected to as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Was a commercial type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , and we sat there, my brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly people, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all alone as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And we had this train trip to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I was -- was probably playing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka Pollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I played with whatever she had over there, I inspected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And it was a big t-tin can there, and I asked her what is this all about, what is this for? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And so she tells me, we’ ll use that at happy occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my brother’s Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But that -- that scene of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Do you know how long it took?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Several days, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  And did they wein -- the Weinmanns have food that they brought with them, so that you could eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  They brought some food, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They brought some food and provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I assume -- I assume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase, or some bag or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor does my brother really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But people had their belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , we were placed with the Dutch population. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They was s- segmented, they compartmentalized the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Sometimes different groups met all across th-the <span class="DLF">borders</span> , in some sense, but we were among the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That again, in retrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp - | heard, and people spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Not that we knew people -- I don’t think we knew many people over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well, whom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our guardian, Malka Pollaczek. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children’s home in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> in Terezin as well, which came to my advantage later. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The Dutch compound, we were put in the caserne, that -- not -- not <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty impressive stone <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> , and surrounding were -- originally were made for <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> <span class="REGION">Dutch compound</span> , we were put in the caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty impressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were made for quarters for soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And they used it for the people who were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the -- those casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Had three tiers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> -- three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And men were separated from the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I now went with my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  She was in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  Also in the same <span class="BUILDING">Hamborg caserne</span> , that’s where the Dutch were. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And they were [indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And in that respect you look at it now, it looks like, you know with the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , with kind of tiered, round <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But all of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But people always say that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> is an attractive <span class="NPIP">place</span> compared with the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and they’re absolutely correct in that respect, but it’s not a place recommend for a vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  Or for a pleasant journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">It was -- had it’s own drabness all the time, of the stench and the physical environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So again, I do see a visi -- a vision of a -- of the scene of brown wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , three tiers, and lots of people, and crowded, and noisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">But it was not a calm environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Bedbugs, lice on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , killing at night was an activity, you know to s-swipe them, do away with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And then had get -- got a new routine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental images of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Was -- okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Because you had these big <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> , and then from caserne to caserne there was another <span class="DLF">walkway</span> , and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of the <span class="BUILDING">caserne</span> for a reason I’Il tell you in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So you had a sense of not being totally confined to one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , or one narrow <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And that kind of tri -- helped the physical benefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But it wa -- once you’re in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But I was basically confined to that <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> for line-up, for soup, for the meals, and for daily activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And the learning study group I mentioned before, the study group was up in that <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> , up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we -- I went on a basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So I didn’t, again, wander around much till later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And a lot of the parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I may not even allowed to be there for all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So you stuck where you belonged, and where I had some reason to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the <span class="BUILDING">study place</span> , the first stage of my stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And spent the time there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  Let me go back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Do you remember your arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  We had to walk a long distance from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Later, I think they extended the train tracks, because when -- eventually right outside of Hamborg caserne, there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> <span class="DLF">train tracks</span> , because when -- eventually right outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamborg caserne</span> , there was a fence, and the <span class="DLF">train tracks</span> that was visible to my -- later on I saw people come and go, those [indecipherable] my activities during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But I don’t think in our time we got that close. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We had to walk, I think a half an hour [indecipherable] what. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But there was a parade of people marching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my legs held up, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So it didn’t leave as an impression of a torturous rite. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I don’t know what id -- had no idea what I was in for. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">See, adults in all likelihood have more uncertainties and more concerns for -- they knew who they left behind, what they left behind, rumors, all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So they’re walking with a different attitude that I -- I was a child again, not -- be -- being protected and being ignorant helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But I did not, you know, find that, you know, gruesome or onerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I may have been tired, as a child, but moved along, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I was prodded along, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So I -- that part, in some sense I skipped easier than settling into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Was there a registration process at --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  There was a registration process, which I don’t recall being involved, maybe Miss Malka Pollaczek took care of, maybe my brother took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Vaguely I recall something, standing on <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Lot of <span class="DLF">line</span> standing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Lining for food, was a <span class="DLF">line</span> always. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Morning line-up sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Evening I think also. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So there were <span class="DLF">lines</span> , so -- but at the -- the registration p -- part, again I -- I -- being a child, you -- I take it for granted you stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> , or you do it, what you were told to do, so -- so it never left a big impact on me, or impression, as other people find that -- was very cold when we arrived in February. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And again, as I mentioned, for how we survived overall cold with inadequate clothing, in all likelihood, pretty impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Course I went -- we visited in 1996, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> , was also February, by chance, and was bitter, bitter cold with a winter jacket, and with gloves and a scarf. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And tell my wife that not see how I could have done that so many years before, but I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Did you see any brutality when you first arrived? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Were people screaming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  I don’t recall anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  So while it was crowded, it was not a hysterical scene to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  I don’t -- I didn’t -- I don’t recall any of that, I mean I don’t know whether there was or there wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  So, I mean I can’t be a witness for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I more recall was the daily routine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  The <span class="DLF">food line</span> -up, I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">All of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a little metal bowl and a spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">How I, as a young child in 1944, held onto that without losing it -- I believe I didn’t lose it, I still wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Because nowadays a lot of school kids can’t keep their lunch card for one day, or other tickets, or so, and that mu -- mean -- it was [indecipherable] my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">In order to get food you need the bowl, you need the card. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And I never lost the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Where -- where would you put the bowl? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Did you tie it on a belt or something, or you don’t know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Carried it with me, or put it back in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> when I wa -- was through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  But I have again these images of walking around at the -- at the serving time, with a spoon and a bowl, and lining up. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And there was a strategy of where to line up, and when to line up, because the main meal often contained like a barley soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And if you came early you got the water, if you came at the end you got nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">If you want to get water and barley, which had the most substance, you had to be positioned in the right time of your <span class="DLF">line</span> -up, the people positioned themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for position where to go, partly because of what you get. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I was part of that jockeying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  And you knew that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  I sensed it, yeah, I knew this, I knew that, I was [indecipherable] to become -- after awhile I become streetwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I was again told -- but that was part of my job, to be there on time, at the right time, the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> to get a better serving. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There were times I came late. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There were times I came too early. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But every can’t be in the middle, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But that whole -- not tension, that whole -- at -- at -- attention, too, and focus on getting your food or so, became part of your daily routine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  You know, have your bowl and have your food and have your <span class="DLF">line</span> -up. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Like it was a time consuming affair through three times --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And what -- what did this ration card look like? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Did y -- did someone cl -- clip off --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Clipped off a piece -- I think they were --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  They clipped off a piece?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  Yes, piece of paper I think that little sections to --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 little coupons, and took -- each day took three.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  And did you get the soup <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , or <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Outside, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  It was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  In the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  -- and you ate -- and you ate <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  I think ate <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and sometimes <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But they out -- the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> was it -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where again, you saw [indecipherable] one photograph, that was the kind of scene you could remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">All Jewish people in -- interned people who were there, with coats and the star on their jackets were serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who knew who you were, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And it was a daily routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The food wasn’t very much food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">With black bread, with cok -- grain coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got too. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The barley soup, several times a week there was horsemeat, and vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Now, one vegetable which lasted for me after the war, as well as a -- we called a [indecipherable] initially, 1s a -- something which young people don’t know, now we call them green beans, but they were used to call string beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Now, string beans had a lot of strings in the one they served. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">You ate, and you had your mouth, basically you had the feel of those greens, whatever you got, and then the mouth full of these strings, which you couldn’t chew, you couldn’t digest, and you spit them out, or so [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">That was my concept of eating string beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So after the war, when it was served, I couldn’t eat them for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Because they also, still in 40’s, they still had some strings, not as much string or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So that was the kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it kept me going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Were you hungry? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Do you remember being -- feeling hungry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  I don’t recall feeling hungry, but was pretty standardized meal, no, you know, special features.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  -- your rations were adequate enough to keep going. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I wasn’t working, so I was kind of, you know, wandering around most of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And -- but the -- the food item was an important part of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And having protect your bowl and your ration coupon was an occupation, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Did your brother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  My brother did --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was he old enough?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  -- he was old enough, he was put in some work activity, like messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">ANSWER:  He served as a messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Deliver internal -- they had -- see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> was organized as a functioning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with certain activities, with some semblances of normalcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail, not the [indecipherable] principles, and people were assigned work, and were assigned to do certain activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So my brother did work as a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically wandered around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  Your sister, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  My sister a little less, I think also -- she also did. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">My recollection is that, you know, I played soccer with a tin can, that was my toy, kick the tin can. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">That was really my outdoor activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">This woman, Malka Pollaczek -- Malka -- married [indecipherable] Pollaczek, Malka Weinmann was moved to administer a children’s home in relatively nice <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , in fact, was one very attractive <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that they converted to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> in relatively nice quarters, in fact, was one very attractive building that they converted to a home for children, and she was the administrator for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And after she moved to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , she found the means to bring me to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> as well if I wanted to, or -- or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Of course it was a little better condition, better food they served, lard as part a supplement of the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Where there was [indecipherable] only for children, as we were, loose children at the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And given that we ate kosher, we -- I remember we had a discussion, my brother, my sister and I, whether I should go to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- because the attraction was eating lard. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And so first of all, I -- I di -- wasn’t eager to separate anyhow, but that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks it’s good for me, I’ Il be better off, nicer physical environment and better food, that [indecipherable] my interest, so we consulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahead, under the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Go there and eat there, because you have a better chance of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So in answer to your question, whether the food was ample, it really was a consideration for me to get better food, with my interest, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So I moved to the children’s home quarters, and -- but I did go visit my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That was further away from Hamborg caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamborg caserne</span> , so I had to cross over one -- a big courtyard to get from here to there, and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt like, or [indecipherable] it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So I had had more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> than before, and I did wi -- as a functional walk, I didn’t explore the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So life moved on, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can I ask you something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Since you were religious --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  -- and as a kid you understood that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  Did it bother you to have the non-kosher food, I mean that it star --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didn’t --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , although the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which was not -- definitively not kosher like. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I mean, the soup may have had horsemeat content in there, but it’s -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be eaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">That’s why I had to - we had to debate it, or discuss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no, of what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and [indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it’s permissible, and I should go, and it’s in my interest to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew more -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So it became a legitimate discussion issue, but --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Maybe I didn’t ask the question in a way that was understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I meant when you actually ate there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  -- after it was okay -- it was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Yes, I don’t think I had a great abhorrence. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And most probably kids don’t really know what they’re eating anyhow, once it’s served.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  No, the issue was the underlying principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  You know, so no, that. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I’m sorry, that was your question. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I did not sense it was, you know, just didn’t taste good, or th -- I didn’t put up a battle subsequently of saying no, I don’t, that’s not for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Did you know that people were being transported out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We were associated very close to the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Outside there was a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> , a metal fence, and a major part of the day I spent around that <span class="DLF">fence</span> <span class="DLF">metal fence</span> , and a major part of the day I spent around that fence watching the activity of the <span class="BUILDING">train depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">A lot of them -- the arrivals I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not only I, other people standing over there, where they from? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Cause sometimes they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Or from relatives they had, even if they’re from a dif -- different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said, oh not for me, I don’t know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing, same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that this came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults met acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and taking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew, obviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Although subsequently I have to mention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Did I know people were leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> too, but what 1t meant -- you see, two way traffic, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt with, that they weren’t there any more after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So there was a [indecipherable] whether people made friendships or so, it’s different -- different friendships with people are there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody’s name, and suddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I had that sense of coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And 1n <span class="DLF">line</span> -ups -- in the time of day we had <span class="DLF">line</span> -ups, the different groups lined up near the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , so that conversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Danish sing-song, and as a kid started making fun, or trying to imitate, and learning different phrases from people. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But I’d never picked up the language, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But there as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how long it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind of came [indecipherable] curious what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So there was more -- I think the arrivals left a bigger impact on me than the departures, because I had no idea where people are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I knew where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And you -- suddenly you sit next to the Danes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But we were not allowed to mix, and we -- there really was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> between the nationalities, unless they put them in the same caserne. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So I became more aware of the change of population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my brother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So they categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential [indecipherable] I’m not clear why she survived, but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Anyway, that part I -- that one part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of have a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or so, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  -- or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So anyway, the momentum that’s -- the scene was changing, the war scene was changing was evident, and was part of the discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And that I do recall being there, participating, absorbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">On again, on a daily, incremental basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">By the end of it, you know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And I recall the final days or so where the troops of the German Nazis were leaving, and for good luck threw hand grenades over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> for us, for now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">But that’s already before we got it, that’s a good sign, because they’re good-bye, and good riddance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So that was the approach towards the end of the war which changed the mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I think a lot of people -- and again I capture that indirectly being -- being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Right, I know exactly the details of what was happening.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1232">ANSWER:  That was growing, growing, more people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">People hanging around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And you hear this [indecipherable] you know, we being -- going to be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">You understood what was happening, that end was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And then, see these mass, you know, departures, it also was consistent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">So now the people -- question of when will [indecipherable] people most probably listen to some kind of radio or other features, then they -- that’s -- word spread amongst each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I was obviously not party to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And -- but it sounded more real that what other people were talking about, and I kind of integrated that into my absorption, whatever I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">ANSWER:  You have to re-recollect that when I child hears things, it is not all as logical as what’s being presented, or as totally comprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone, a change of discussion topics, and that’s what I was capturing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Did food change? </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Did you still ge -- you still ate in the way you had before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1246">ANSWER:  Same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  Same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  As far as I’m aware, the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Not aware of any change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1250">QUESTION:  Any change in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1251">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">QUESTION:  Do you remember the Russians when they came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">QUESTION:  What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">ANSWER:  First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Was a -- and the people themselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and chocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind, and a breath of fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were guarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different - you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that’s what -- that’s what they left the impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I did know, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to the caserne of the -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I saw that scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not obviously, but I just didn’t see, or didn’t know what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">That’s later, but the grabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war period is -- was very kind of shocking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">But they di -- transformed very quickly, the role of the being behind the <span class="DLF">fences</span> versus being free, and more movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I think the <span class="DLF">fence</span> came down, or -- but we still had a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , I remember was the -- suddenly you saw the German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up, and fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some former German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more privileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you know, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">So the -- again, that was a very different atmosphere what you saw before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So that’s the Russians kind of influence, a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis, or Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean, just reversed direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being liberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And very noticeable, and to -- very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June already we were out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1270">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  Now, a lot of people didn’t make it to later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a quarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> where these other people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">I don’t know whether in our particular compound, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don’t know what -- we were allowed to leave in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Again, some people say you couldn’t have left in June because there was a general quarantine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Well, I know I left in June, you know, I mean --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1276">ANSWER:  I don’t care what the historian books say on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">People verif -- generalize from the generic fact, and apply it to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1278">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So where did you all go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And -- and who -- was it Leo who made the decision</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick effort to identify, locate people who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And whoever did this, might -- the Russians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and people from different <span class="REGION">localities</span> contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe Red Cross [indecipherable] I don’t recall, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And we had relatives who survived the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my family, partly they’re -- they were raised in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , very close in the same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch relatives they had, and went around finding out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> most probably, with the Dutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my sister and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving from their records was us three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people, who went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo- you will come back, you have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go -- the people who were released from these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had a -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">We had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go because somebody was claiming us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a displaced persons camp, or hang around later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> , or hang around later in Theresienstadt, I don’t know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, whose parents survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were claiming her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">So we all went back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to the American section, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> kind of was split into different <span class="REGION">regions</span> <span class="REGION">American section</span> , you know, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">One half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> , and maybe took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I think a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French plane</span> , was probably a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transport plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And we stayed a few days or so with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And you ask what attachment, that was probably -- I -- we sensed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And well, a very different life suddenly, you know, plates, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , and food that we never had eaten before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">White bread was served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I had a tin can of anchovy paste, I don’t know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Spent a few days over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers, who themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">The daughter, son and parents were in three different <span class="NPIP">locations</span> , and they were --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And they all survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">ANSWER:  They survived, yes, they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And then I rejoined living with them after, for one year or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the Sigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">So we spent a year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to June, from °45 to 46, and being -- lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">QUESTION:  And how was that for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1305">ANSWER:  Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">I mean, s-sitting at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the family rather than in a compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Cooking, baking, washing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> before, and I think they lived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And they lived behind a <span class="DLF">partition wall</span> for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Couldn’t go out in daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Didn’t know where their daughter and son was -- were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Their daughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as a open house help, au pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">It’s -- her name is Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And she was there, and -- very interesting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com- can’t do anything on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on Saturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">But they were very devout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their own children, so they couldn’t say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the very devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays, to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about, it was kind of -- and they’re very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We met them after they came, they were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> up in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , again didn’t see daylight, public daylight for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the underground, emblems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I believe that’s how he spent his time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">And so the reconstituting of life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , kosher restaurant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their apartment was gone, all their belongings were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">They couldn’t -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn’t get it back, even because they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">People denied, apparently that they had received anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">They had to start from scratch, in very small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , we lived in very, very small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">We had a little metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to <span class="INT_SPACE">public baths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">This was the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Of course they would -- had the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> before, they’re still -- so they’re getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Some widowers, or single people, lost their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Whether they paid or not, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">These people, the Bergers, at this <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , also kept kosher, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And basically ate dairy, because they didn’t have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">But because of their hospitality reputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , or from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or ate in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">But didn’t have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">So the cans were warmed up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">That’s the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> with all the trappings of a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , having to serve their own in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">But they made -- they made the transition, we’ll open up another <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">QUESTION:  They did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> , of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Uh huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Meant, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">ANSWER:  -- in the long run, that was not a issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And were you told that once you had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , or do you -- do you have any recollection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  No, I think already most probably before, because when we got that postcard from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , in discussions with my brother and sister, whenever it may have come up, I think I had it already a general sense --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">ANSWER:  -- that I have no longer my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1373">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1374">ANSWER:  But after the war, when you hear other stories of -- people’s life stories of losing a husband, a wife, children, then I realized that -- where I fit it in, that I also lost parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I was part of the group of people who went through the war, some went through in hiding, be -- people in groups, some were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Some were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , some were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> some were in convents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And I was in two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and some people lost -- or didn’t lose, and I lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">So eventually I fit it in to my category, and -- but that was a pretty dynamic -- I use the word dynamic selectively, seeing people were really -- had to re- establish themself, that some people could make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And also it was very much evident people want get out of Europe as -- or <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> as fast as possible, many people, they -- the first opportunity to get out, and especially the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">They sh --</p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And myself also left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We joined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">My brother was older, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice, not too many other children around, they let me come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And we went to hikes and activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that obviously you didn’t have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I still know by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And I’ve discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , and one lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and one here, one no longer lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">But that kind of life became more normalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , Jewish school, and es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">So it kind of -- but even those teachers started leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">We had the teacher, and the middle of the year they went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">Of course, it was not a -- people weren’t on the firm ground, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that’s what other people were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">But it was not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative ranking that the Bergers, my father’s brother lived the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and they were also related to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">And my mother’s sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> wanted us to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">So we were wanted, but we were kind of being pulled in two different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And the decision was that the two boys would go to New York, and the girl would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and the girl would go to Zurich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">Whether that’s wi -- wise decision or not 1s not for me to say.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1431">QUESTION:  Ah, I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1432">ANSWER:  I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerness to want to absorb us, and you know, take care of us as children without parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And they decided, not to divide the spoils, but they thought that boys would be better off in education, particularly Jewish education in United States, and the girl would fit in better in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and the girl would fit in better in Switzerland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">My aunt had a -- uncle had a <span class="BUILDING">dress store</span> , an elegant <span class="BUILDING">dress store</span> , and she could perhaps work her way into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">But anyway, we were split, which my sister to this day finds horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">And she found it very surprising that it was proposed and implemented.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1438">ANSWER:  It was difficult, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And especially those were days where na -- ba -- people didn’t have telephone conversations, you know, you wrote to each other, kept in touch that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1440">QUESTION:  But she of course, remains even more alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">You are split, but you’re still with the one --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1821">QUESTION:  Did your uncle talk to you a lot about your father and your mother, so you could get a -- a- a picture of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1822">ANSWER:  No, he talked very little about his family in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1823">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1824">ANSWER:  And talked very, very little about my father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">My aunt from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> talked more, oddly enough.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1828">ANSWER:  Not oddly, I think, just different circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">And my uncle was much more tight lipped about family in general, or -- not to [indecipherable] re us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">In part I also think that he -- that’s more speculation than fact, but I feel that maybe even fact, he I think felt somewhat guilty that he did not do more to get my parents out, whether it would be more encouraging or physical action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">He himself had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in ’41 or so, so there were some years involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">I have no idea -- I have no clue how much contact they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">He told us [indecipherable] was very -- always a very -- my -- my father was the older brother, and he always told about his respect and, you know, esteem for him, only to talk to him as a younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">But he never talked about details of background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">But he never talked about his own -- to his own children either, too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">So when I speak to my cousins, his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped him for information just in the family tree. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1837">indecipherable] or so, and his background or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">Anyways, the answer to your question is no, very little information about my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">So that’s another void.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1840">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1841">ANSWER:  How they lived, how they celebrated, how they did things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">My brother knows a little bit more, my sister knows bits and pieces, I know very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">That’s certainly a blank compared to other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1844">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1845">ANSWER:  Wa -- so again, that -- it’s understandably I was a very little boy, right, so I don’t recall where -- and my sister mentions to me that for my father’s 40" birthday he got a electric shaver.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1847">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t know, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">That was a big deal in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to get an electric shaver, because people used to use shaving paste --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1849">ANSWER:  -- to do the beards, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1850">QUESTION:  Let me ask you an odd -- something of an odd question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">When you mentioned the postcard, and your brother telling you of the postcard, something happened to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1852">ANSWER:  I choked up a little more, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1853">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">What is it, 1-is that symbol of the loss for you, do you think, or s --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  In part it’s a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">I mean, for parents to write a farewell note to parent -- to the children is not normal, and for a brother to end up saying [indecipherable] which means I will see you again, and never materialized, is a painful message to receive, but never follow through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">So more emotions may be evoked from that than describing that they went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and they open up a -- a suitcase in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1857">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">Is there anything else you’d like to mention that I have not asked? </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">I’m sure there’s --</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1862">ANSWER:  -- was -- meant for me, what I -- what little part I played as one individual, and -- well, in some sense our families are like mic-microcosm of one type of --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1863">ANSWER:  -- Holocaust story, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">And the implications of it all are serious, you know, let’s talk about millions of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">Here’s a very, you know, quote, normal family that was split apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1866">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1867">ANSWER:  To the extent that I have four children and a family and grandchildren, my two brothers would had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard, and my parents never saw grandchildren, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">So all the human relationships, and all the human events, were kind of disrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">I had a disjointed childhood at best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">My brother had consequences of it, my sister are similar, you know, so this is just one family to, quote, just one family, and there’s plenty of damage, and I repeat again, I did not [indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or ber -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and tell horrible stories, you know, on a personal basis or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">But that’s just a kind of little composite story of one family and how it spreads, what happened to us, and how one takes it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1882">ANSWER:  This is a portrait picture of my mother that was taken, I believe, after her marriage, I don’t know exact dates on this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">And it was this plus the next one from my father, was given to us by very, very close friends of my mother, who had it in their collection, and when we came back after the war to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they wanted to make sure that we have pictures of our parents, and they enlarged it, and framed it, I believe, and -- and have been with us since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">They hang on a <span class="DLF">wall</span> in our din -- <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> .</span></p>
