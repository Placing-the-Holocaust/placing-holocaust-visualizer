women undressed upon arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Then the marched us to the left where the women and the children were. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We undressed in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , but the women and the children were inside the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">When we came to take their clothes, nobody was there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Just a heap of clothing that we carried to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> we delivered the men's belongings. </span><span

id="158">We did it running...back and forth, back and forth, we were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">While running back and forth, we heard the German calling, "Who 1s a barber?" </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I thought what did I have to lose and I said, "I am a barber." </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They had already four men chosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was the fifth man. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">A friend of mine that followed me was rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I...I called on him to come close but it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The Germans did not want any more barbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He took the five of us to the clothes magazines <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and ordered them to give us a pair of pants, a pair of shoes, and a shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The Germans ordered all to perform all works.

id="169">I did not know what mine...what mine assignment 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I knew how to work there from another man who worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He said, "Get yourselves a pair of scissors." </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We were also warned by one of the men who belonged to the barber work, that we must work in bent down positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">If not, we will be constantly beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The Germans walked around us with whips, constantly beating us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">As soon as I start to work, I got a beating and was bleeding from my head and face. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I find some water, washed away the blood and returned to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">This is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The first work was sorting the heaps of clothes, separating the shirts, pants, coats, and eyeglasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Not just sorting, but also checking to see if jacket collars, cuffs of the pants, or the shoulder pads were hiding anything of value. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">If you found money or a ring, we put it in a designated <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">People hoped that they can save it. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we had to control that. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">sorting barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We looked...diamonds separate, rings separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">There I worked for about 2
