<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And when were you reunited with -- with your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> on, I remember, a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And the reason this 1s prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> f -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that I had taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span> perhaps around four or five o’clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I called from the <span class="BUILDING">bus station</span> , and I was told to immediately come. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> , and when finally we were approaching our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , and my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I expected to be greeted in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">In fact, there was not a single person in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And I walked up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I rang the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span> two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Of course, I- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn’t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I didn’t know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Shabitai’s</span> to see my family? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and Mrs. Shabitai opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and she embraced me, and I was shown into their <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where 1s mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn’t the time to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">That was the -- the reunion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I have to -- to cover 1v -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I -- in -- in the beginning of December of °44, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And these troubles primarily occurred in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There -- there was fighting in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the events, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and eventually to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of 45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed, and I couldn’t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn’t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Also, I must note that the apar -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They were occupying half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they couldn’t be evicted, or -- or -- 1t was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So my father and I sort of lived in half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another - another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And indeed, in -- in September of "45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> , before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that’s ano -- a different chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When you were a teenager, you had been working. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in June of ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Since the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I was -- my father found a job for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Occasionally -- and the only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And also, occasionally, small bars of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, this individual, who was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , and who was a -- in the stock market in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , established himself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and then started a -- an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> in Salonika, the <span class="BUILDING">legal stock market</span> , he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">A bureau conducting this sort of activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let’s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">For instance, while Rommel was advancing in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> , then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So this is what, essentially, he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And my job was -- I didn’t do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let’s say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was, let’s say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we- we had a number of shelves in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Woolens, and some silks, pretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  And was this a Jewish enterprise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And when you mention your neighbors in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above, were -- were they Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally family contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I think people they knew from Monisteer, or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Mr. and Mrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yarninar</span> , and Mr. Shabitai was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trikola</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in 1492. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and eventually ended up in that part of the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> , which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I mean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and - | mean, 1s -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Do you see any difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">No, no, I -- I -- I don’t recall -- really I think that I couldn’t distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our relatives, and other Greeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephardim. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt- a sister of my mother’s, that’s the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Was Ladino your mother tongue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Not mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher of French, and my father had studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  But you don’t know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very beginning? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Perhaps you were speaking Ladino and French right from infancy on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t believe that I spoke Ladino. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Perhaps, before I began to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I believe, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  I’m backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Do you have a sense of how he was coping? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular point, he had lost his wife and two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Or in discussions I have with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- Ica -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So I don’t think that there was, let’s say, reluctance. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">A episode of things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But not very much about personal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Greek mountains</span> with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We didn’t go into -- into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So he was always hobbled. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April ’45, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was still totally unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I think he spoke of that, I’m assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And you were the oldest, and you’d had your Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In the summer of °39, my father took me to a -- there’s a -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> about a hundred kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , it’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lutrikey</span> , and it’s a -- sort of a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And they were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was essentially a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I recall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had begun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was we were going to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And we’re going to buy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So it was the first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let’s say dreams and plans for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of °39, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of ’39, it’s the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn’t touch <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greece</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The war had started, it was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it’s horrors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , but it was so far away that it didn’t yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, it’s a long detour to what’s -- what -- what you ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So | -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think 1t was because he knew from all the reports of the 30’s, since the rise of Hitler in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the history of the -- of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaspora</span> , all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don’t think he -- no one knew at that time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but he knew that 1t was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So he -- he -- it was a second instance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it’s better to -- to be dead, than be caught alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  And I would assume then, that there might have been more confidences shared at that stage in your life, were it not for the fact that I think you s -- you also talk earlier in your interview on videotape about the pall that descended, so that it became a situation from your parents when they -- their fears were something they di -- they wanted to protect you from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can still feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I don’t re -- recall that there was, let’s say, a smile on their faces after about mid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about both Monasteer and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Those occur about two or three weeks apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And the -- although -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some that was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And as I say, I -- from then on, I don’t recall their being a single smile in their faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now I’ve lost track of what you asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Oh, and they wanted to protect you, I think, from their fears.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  I believe we were talking about the situation a-after April ’43, when the news from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and Monasteer came, and I think I was alluding to the fact that although our parents did not take us into their confidence about their concern, their worries, but I can only surmise, and I’m almost positive now in checking with my brother, that a lot of the time, intervening time, was spent in preparing for -- not inevitability, but in -- in the event that the same thing would occur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Because I cannot explain in any other way, the fact that practically as soon as the signal was given to disperse in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , the plan was already in place about where to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the friends, or the people with whom you -- your family, not -- not you, ultimately, sought shelter, or -- or -- or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and the extent to which those people took risks, or did not take risks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I- | would speak about my role first. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Although again, I hadn’t discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn’t even met his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He says, “They’ll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So that sort of was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very quickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four at most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very apparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see, suddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So, this person was essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Certainly until my departure from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> about a month later, with a -- a couple, they were childless. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her name was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so they were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Next <span class="DLF">door</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , was a man who had a small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that was really a mini variety store. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in the back o-of -- he had thread, and needles. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was that -- that sort of <span class="BUILDING">convenience neighborhood store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with this individual, and he had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> on the eastern side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , really a -- a vi -- a far <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that’s where my mother and two brothers went. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So when we dispersed, that’s how we -- that’s where we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  You ask about risks. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Well, really all of them took risks, and the same risks, because the Germans made it known that sheltering Jews, or sheltering people like members of the resistance, whether arm resistance or the political resistance was a capitol offense, an -- and from time to time they would shoot them in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So taking risks was quite a -- a -- well-known, and all of them took risks, and the same risks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I was interested 1n the -- what took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and it seemed to me that -- and I think you mentioned this, that Greeks helped the Jews, and they said, “We're all humans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It’s common humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But I think it’s worth you discussing that more, just because something happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where -- perhaps it was baser instincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And that enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for things of that sort to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Look at <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">In 1941 they pass a law, which has about -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But it was almost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it’s provisions were clearly anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Or what happened to the Romanian Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Half a million people were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Or the -- the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Most of them died of starvation by the Ustasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, the Germans, by no means had - didn’t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They rose it to -- to heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [</span><span class="sentence" id="191">indecipherable] Salonika Jews, they were telling them that they gonna send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and -- and un- unfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> was a -- a gullible, naive, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> that their brethren in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> were going to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Of course, the Germans didn’t tell them that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> had already been totally eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So this kind of a thing hadn’t reached <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Maybe -- I don’t know, maybe the ethnic character, 1t would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often think that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">When I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and one sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So I feel a personal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Also, do you think that the role of the <span class="BUILDING">Greek church</span> was very critical in being outspoken and saying that we oppose this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Look, le-le-let’s put things perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There was really one extremely courageous voice, that’s was Thamskino’s, the archbishop, who not only protested openly, and who I think, perhaps -- I don’t know if it was mentioned in the videotaping, he was threatened by the German general Stupa that he would be shot, and Thamaskino said, “Greek clergy traditionally have been hanged.” </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And he expected Stupa to follow the same tradition, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But look, I know of no really massive -- by that I mean even in t - in the [indecipherable] of Jews that were saved through the action of the <span class="BUILDING">Greek Orthodox church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The -- it is a fact that Thamaskinos, the archbishop said that Jews would find refuge in <span class="BUILDING">monasteries</span> , but I really don’t know of a single case where Jews survived because they were sheltered in <span class="BUILDING">monasteries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There are not remarkable stories of righteous acts, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Oh, there are -- there are lots, but they -- they -- they are not on the part of an organized body, wha -- be it the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">For example, the then chief of police, Evert, he -- I mean, in the German occupation, he personally issued or gave orders, and faked id -- identity cards were issued to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">These -- these were acts of heroism that are -- really were individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Other than Evert, and this act of Thamaskinos of open protest, all the other Jews who were saved was through the act of, I think, great humanity, first of all, and even at times against a -- a -- you know, a palpable danger on the part of individual Greeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Let’s go on now to the reunion with your brother Samuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Well, as you recall from the other tape, beginning in May, or June of ’45 as I recall, when the first news of the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , then -- and -- and -- and - and DP’s -- displaced persons began to be processed, then there were both -- there were reports both in the Greek newspapers, and also on the radio of rec-recitation of names of the known people who were -- would be returning. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And I found this out from a neighbor in the -- in one morning, that she had heard my brother’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But within really t-two or three days shortly after this news, Sam already had been moved, eventually from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bali</span> , and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pardres</span> , and then he called on the phone and told us that he was arriving, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and -- and there he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Well, 1-1 -- first of all, I cou -- I didn’t recognize him right away, because he had grown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see -- we had seen each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And two things I think, or one thing s -- that struck me was that his behavior, at least outwardly in the days and weeks after his return, to -- at least to me it appeared as if he had not really -- or -- or -- or all these horrors, and all these experiences had not left such a -- a -- a mark on him, because he -- he would laugh, and sing, and -- and I remember he was into -- into jazz, and -- and -- and modern music, and going out with -- with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Whereas I had really, in the -- in the -- in the months in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , I had spent a great deal of time just thinking about what had happened, and also looking to a much better situation afterwards, and I had all kinds of plans, and especially about my mother, who was always a very demanding woman, and who I thought was not -- never satisfied with my accomplishments, and that she would be very proud about things that I was going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And -- and -- and I had been, I think, much more touched by the events than I could see Sam. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Of course, it’s very difficult to read what is really deep in -- in somebody’s mind, or psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But at least outwardly, I was astounded at the resilience of human beings to go through this -- this horror which you would begin to see in newsreels and read progressively in books, that the term Holocaust hadn’t even been invented yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But I was astounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  And did you -- were you able to come up with any explanation of how Sam could be coping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Well, the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young, absolu -- in absolute terms, but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14, there was more elasticity in -- in -- in somebody’s mind and character and emotions than there would be -- we only had four years apart -- in any -- 1n any case, it -- it -- I was much more affected by the -- by the war experience, all the events, than I saw Sam being affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And that’s -- simply surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">How did you view, subsequently, your decision not to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , but to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In a sense it seemed to me you -- your -- you were 1n hiding, but you were in hiding with the partisans in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I have -- I have thought about this thing very, very much, but I -- I can really tell you that 1t was not resolved of a great deal of rational thinking, and weighing of factors for and against. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I can only ascribe it to pure instinct, number one, to a aspect of my personality that I simply -- when I thought about it, I re -- re-refused to -- to -- to -- to s -- to s -- to accept the possibility of remaining in hiding for an indeterminate period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I had never been away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , although the Mikalopoulus’s were very kind to me, they accepted me, th-th -- Thanasis, my friend, was the only child, the only son, and -- and there was never any hesitation, accepting me as another, but it wasn’t really that I felt a stranger, simply that I could not withstand a life of continuous hiding, which then made me an -- and the moment this took root, then what I call personality, I -- P’ve believe that what is referred to sometimes, I’m goal oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">That means I -- once I set a -- a target, then I -- I do whatever I can to -- to -- to reach that -- that outcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">That was what propelled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The -- it wasn’t really based on any other set of weighing of rational pieces of information for or against. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That was going to be it, and I was going to a total unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I didn’t even know where I was going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Was part of it your wish to be actively resisting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The active wish was to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  And I wonder if you talked with your father about this, but it seems that for those in hiding, they must have been -- have felt imperiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I mean, when they’d go to sleep at night, you never knew when you wou -- would be denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I think of how fearful a time it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and brothers were taken for questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Did you talk to your father about what that stage was like for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  The answer 1s, we didn’t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let’s put some dates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They were incarcerated in the detention camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hithari</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> of Hithari. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And on July 29, they were put on board the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that ever left <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I can imagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a negative <span class="NPIP">side</span> , lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my father, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Also, perhaps -- we didn’t cover that, I don’t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my father changed <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only maintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So there would come a time when it was time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really ostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So my father moved three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother, grandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the third <span class="NPIP">place</span> , before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And simply, he must have realized that something had happened, because there were no contact -- there was no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Of course, he found out immediately after -- after the liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">What did Sam later tell you about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I mean, were they -- were they brutally treated, because I -- I think the Germans would want to find out where your father and you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected -- not the young one, not the me -- Mekko. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they kept on asking them about my father’s and my whereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Of course, in -- 1n a case for me, she did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really destitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">She did not know where I had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I’m sure my father told her, “He’s gone to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But even with my father I didn’t com -- there was no way to communicate and -- and send notes from time to time, I’m -- I’m fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">There were no ways of doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So the combination of her concern about my fate and whereabouts, and -- and the brutality and the beatings, and -- and the other thing which is so revealing about my mother that Sam mentions in his interview, was her almost foolhardy defiance of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their comeuppance would come very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know, that’s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But it’s an aspect that’s -- is so telling about -- about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I don’t think that’s -- I don’t even know if my father knew about these events. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They didn’t come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I didn’t learn about what I just related to you, until I saw Sam’s interview with the sh -- the Spielberg foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  I think you had mentioned earlier that in that family, that one family council meeting, you had agreed that you would never disclose where each of you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And it’s interesting therefore, your mother’s defiance. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But I wonder also if you had her determination. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">She was a strong personality, I think, and it may have been that spirit from her that drove you to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  I would like to think that that’s the case, but I have to also confess that it was not, again, a conscious thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">In other words, I -- I -- I set my -- I became determined to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">| even -- I mean, in -- in retrospect -- no, you know from my thi -- the other interview, that I didn’t even have an identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I -- I -- I manufactured one of them, which really would not pass scrutiny even by a -- an idiot, but fortunately we were not stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">S -- the fact that -- that -- that I did it, that I didn’t know where I was going to end up, it was something that -- that simply drove me, and if it was a part of -- a similarity in -- in character traits, that’s what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  What did you later learn from Sam about your younger brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I’m wondering if your mother protected him? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I -- I -- I think he was -- he would be 10 when he died, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  He was nine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  I wonder if she would hide from him something of the horrors, and -- but I don’t know what you learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Well, really very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Mekko, as we used to call him, well, his name was -- Mechalmar was his first name, was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">An eight year difference, as you know, is immense among young children, although I re -- I remember I -- when he was two, or three, or four, I was his protector, I would take him to walks, and to play ina number of <span class="NPIP">places</span> near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">There was a square with -- in a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , in a <span class="DLF">playground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But we did not exchange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I -- I don’t th-think I [indecipherable] my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Obviously she protected him in the sense of making sure that he was fed, and - and clothed while they are -- they are hiding, under those circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But, you know, as you -- as you know, children sense, even much younger, so I’m sure that he knew that these were dire times, and I -- I think someone refers the fact that actually the -- the capture, the denouncement was perhaps that both children, in the last place of their hiding, they went out to play in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And maybe more than they should have, and therefore, seeing strange faces, perhaps, gave some people who were not particularly sympathetic to the situation, to spread the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Not maybe maliciously, but once these kinds of things came in, well, there are strangers in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , you gotta remember that the people who discovered them were Greeks collaborating with the Germans, and who perhaps, a the -- I -- of -- out of ideological reasons, but in order to maintain their jobs, they became more zealous than -- or more [indecipherable] than the king, as the saying goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So they went out of their way to -- you know, to -- to chalk up captures. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And that’s how it happened, because they exposed themselves a little bit more than -- than they should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But at the same time, they were young children, and they had to get out and play.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Have you felt a wish to f -- try to find out who revealed where your mother was? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I mean, oh -- did you even feel a wish to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  La -- I’ve asked Sam about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There is no -- no one knows who did -- if there was really someone, or more than one who actually denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I think simply, as I say, the word spread around there were strangers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">This got picked up by these roving collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Now, what is known, however, is that when they were taken to the detention -- to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of the -- of the Gestapo, and -- and the names are very well known, the two or three Jews, including this horrible man named Hasson, who was a terrible collaborator with the Nazis, who made it his job to go and discover hiding Jews, and -- and -- and -- and capture them. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So in -- in -- no one knows, really who -- single person, or other people who did the da -- see -- see -- see -- one of the unknowns.</span></p>

I was interested in knowing when your mother was taken for questioning, with your family, where they were -- where they -- that Gestapo questioning would take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Yes, according to Sam, he -- they were taken to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now, let’s not think that they really went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the chief of the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The ger -- the Germans, they had a -- a major office building in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , not very far from Constitution Square, which was known as the commandatura, which was a c-combined <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the German occupation forces 1n -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> in the center of Athens, not very far from Constitution Square, which was known as the commandatura, which was a c-combined office of the headquarters of the German occupation forces 1n -- in Athens, the Gestapo had. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And because it was a large office building, it had also a -- a large <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> , it had also a -- a large basement. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">That’s where they were -- they were taken for interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Let me just simply tell you that I don’t know if it is -- what kind of poetic justice, or anything like this, when I was taken by the gendarmerie after -- that’s where I was taken, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But that’s where they were taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Now, to what does Sam attribute his having survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  We have ta-talked about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I think essentially, one -- if one has to take a single reason -- well, first of all, let’s say two. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">One that at their arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , 1n the morning of August 16, of 1944, parathetically -- can I say how I -- we know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Yes, because I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are known, which is entries, almost like a diary every day of oc-occurrences. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And the entry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It doesn’t tell the complete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my mother and -- and -- and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They arrived there, and in the -- this of course, famous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , was because of his height. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He was only -- ’44 -- he was 14 years old, but he was a lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hidari</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless labor of moving rocks from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, had -- and the food was good, also, there, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Once then in the labor camp, after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">boodi</span> , which was a set of <span class="DLF">farms</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of Auschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a combination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But the survival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">boodi</span> , in particular then the survival in the famous Death March in the winter of ’45, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> got shut down because of the Russians coming in, and they were taken elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Sam credits it to the care of older men, who took him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">In particular in protecting them about -- especially what not to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And what to be a-a-aware of, because as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each other, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So he believes very strongly that one or two people took him also under their wing, and -- and it was through them that he was able to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  I’m interested in also in knowing of the roles you as brothers fulfilled later, as the eldest son, and the winner of a scholarship, you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Sam stayed with your father, and I -- I’m guessing that he felt an obligation to be -- to spend his life close to your father, emigrating after your father’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I just wondered if you felt that you were a -- a cornerstone of the family, sort of succeeding in the -- in your new life, but fulfilling one critical role?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Well, re-re-recall that I came to the United States on a student scholarship, therefore believing that after my studies were over, I would return to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on a student scholarship, therefore believing that after my studies were over, I would return to Greece, and resume my life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Why Sam stayed, I have really mulled this very much, and I -- I - I don’t have a -- a -- you know, an answer that I can be a hundred percent sure, but both my parents were really maniacal, I think, about making sure that we were well -- well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I -- the decision for me to become an engineer was cast at the -- I think the moment I was born, I think, f -- by my father in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Not a currency trader.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  R-Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Or -- or an accountant, as -- as he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I think that there was a - a particular event. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">In 1952, Sam had, I think, just barely finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He -- he may have been thinking -- I think he did, about going to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , possibly for commercial studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But at the same time, coincidentally, my father retired from his occupation of -- his job that had gone on for 40 years, practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And there were no pension plans as we know them here, but he was given a large final severance amount, which he then decided to -- to -- to use to invest in going into business with somebody who actually was the brother of my stepmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">My father had remarried, and so he started this business, and I think -- I think -- I’m -- I’m almost sure, that it isn’t that my father didn’t push Sam to continue, or to -- to -- to pursue university work, but starting a business, he thought that it would be a wonderful thing to bring my brother in, so that he would also learn the business, and grow with it, and eventually of course, inherit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Unfortunately, it failed for many, many reasons, including the fact that my father, while he was a wonderful accountant, was not a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Plus also that his brother-in-law and partner turned out to be a crook. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And -- and in -- in the meantime then, Sam had also married, and that’s why I think he stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It wasn’t a matter of his feeling that he was forfeiting the opportunity to join you, perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  No, look, although by the time I left, and I -- I know now that my father had started all his efforts to secure a scholarship for me, or -- or some means for me to go and study abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He even wrote letters to Churchill, inflating -- I mean, the truth, beyond- you know, any conceivable acceptable level of -- of -- of -- of recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It’s true that at one time, during the occupation, two Jews of the British army, that had, you know, been stranded in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and were hiding, w -- they -- we -- hi -- hid them in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">In his letter to Churchill, he inflated these [indecipherable | arrangement of British troops, and -- and -- and he was asking for no compensation of any kind, other then op -- an opportunity for his son to have an opportunity to study in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The fact is that also he was starting the same thing with B’nai Brith, because he was a member of the B’nai Brith. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">In -- in fact, he kept all of these things totally secret from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I had no idea what was happening until one -- when it was a done deal, essentially, and he told me at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And actually, my first reaction was to -- to say, “No, I don’t want to her -- leave you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I’m saying all of that -- forgive again the detour -- to tell you that -- I mean, my leaving, and -- and -- and his decision that I go and study abroad, the sacrifices that my father would undergo to see his son educated, had no bounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And I think that under other circumstances, he would have pushed Sam to do the same thing, even if then that meant that he would be left alone, you know, with two sons away. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But as I said, the -- the -- this maniacal thing for education was so strong, the only countervaley thing, I think was that -- that -- that coincidentally he was starting a business, and therefore he saw that there was another <span class="DLF">avenue</span> that would be open for my brother to advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I speculate -- and I was telling this to my wife last night, that if my mother had been alive, Sam would not have gone into that business, she would have pushed him, regardless, to go and -- and -- and -- and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  It’s interesting, your story of your father’s efforts on your behalf, cause I was thinking of when you were -- when you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Libya</span> , he had intervened then, and -- successfully, I think, either was a New York Times reporter that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, well not -- not -- yes, of course, 1-1 -- my father immediately then contacted a cousin -- our cousins, and it was they who then knew the Times’ correspondent who then talked to -- to the archbishop, Thamaskinos. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And it was that way that I was -- I was set free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Yeah, anyway, they’re wonderful stories of a father’s determination. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Now, at this time, would many of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> have been thinking actively of leaving for either <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Very well -- ah, I -- I saw that question, I was laughing a little bit because I have -- I have to tell you what -- what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">There was not, as in for example, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You know, in spite of all the talk about the Bulgarians saving 50,000 Jews, it’s true that -- that they were not killed, but not what then the Bulgarians began to claim. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But the Bulgarians, as you know, marched with their feet, and -- and from 48,000, there are only 3000 left. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">There was less of the mass exodus from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , but th -- recall also, that out of a population of 77,000 pre-war, only about six or 7000 survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I think in one of your questions was how many wer -- were sheltered. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The best numbers that one has, about five or 6000 found shelter, either with Greek Christian families, or in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I don’t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to hide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> that they were known as free Greece, which included the <span class="REGION">region</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">About 1300 were the -- in the resistance, in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But very shortly -- I mean, mid ’45, immediately we had visitors from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis, but totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and -- peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I mean, things out there that you don’t necessarily associate with the appearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> who are -- live soft lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And as you know, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Quite a few were then sent to what’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akshara</span> <span class="BUILDING">Akshara</span> , which was sort of a preparatory school for three or four weeks, to teach the rudiments of living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> <span class="BUILDING">preparatory school</span> for three or four weeks, to teach the rudiments of living in a kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And then it was -- all of 1t was clandestine, because one night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that were not in territorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="REGION">territorial Greek waters</span> , and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in secret, because they didn’t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to violate. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And some of them were caught and incarcerated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cypress</span> , in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I - I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but the reason I’m laughing 1s -- y-you -- it’s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it’s so unreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind of government are we going to have, if eventually a state is formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Because our experience, you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and things like this is we need to be democratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would look at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, “Look, w-we have many things to do before w-we come to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we become a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,” and - and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Well, and that was -- there was a very strong thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The reason I didn’t become extremely serious, you know, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn’t leave my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Sam had not even yet appeared on the scene when these events of the contact with the Israelis occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of course, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it wasn’t even possible to do that any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then of course, my departure from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, made this thing a moot point. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But yes, there was a very strong period of I would say two or three months, where practically I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Now, how much of an honor was it to have that B’nai Brith scholarship? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">W-Were there -- were there many of them, or very few?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The first two were my scholarship, and -- and my second cousin, Jeff Levis. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We left at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">First of all we -- even after everything was put 1n <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- you know, in addition to all the paperwork, visas, this and the other, examination by the American consul that we were at least mildly proficient in -- in English, enough to -- to claim that we were going to go and study in -- in an <span class="BUILDING">American university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But the major th -- thing that -- that -- that -- that one had to wait for -- and that nothing could be done about it, was to wait for passage, because there were no -- there was not much shipping still, it hadn’t been fully restored. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So it took about another four or five months of waiting to get booking on -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So there were two -- it wasn’t done on the basis, let’s say, of competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It was -- I ad -- really wa --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It was your father’s letter writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  My father’s letter writing, and his cousin, you know, Joseph Levi, that, you know, really made th -- there was -- I know now that two other such scholarships were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were not scholastic achievements, it was simply th-that -- that Jews in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> sponsored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Although it was B’nai Brith money, which it certainly didn’t last more than one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And -- and the only reason I was able to continue was because the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> then picked up the -- the sc -- the scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So that’s how it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Then how did you travel to the United States, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , by boat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Well by -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Volcania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It was two Italian ships that had been used during the war as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian ships</span> that had been used during the war as transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It had a sister ship called -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volcania</span> -- not -- not Lusitania, but it’s is -- same Italian -- kind of Italian name, I’ll -- ’1l remember in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It took about 13 to 14 days because we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> to pick up other passengers, and -- you know, it wasn’t a very fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And it took about, you know, maybe 12 days to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  What did you take with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And you thought then you would be there for several years, for the degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  F-For at least four years, for any -- four years, for at least four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Well, of course, other than -- than items of clothing, I took very little else. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Two or three mementos. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">First of all, for the man who sponsored me, who had to sign an affidavit of support as it was called, who I never met in my life, he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalamazoo</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , his name was Osias Souvairdling, my father gave me a present to give him, which was- must have been a very dear thing for him, it was a -- a cigarette case. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He didn’t even know if the man smoked, but it was really done of silver filigree, I think of -- of -- of wire, intricately done, and which I eventually sent to Mr. Souvairdling to thank him profoundly, when ha -- as I say, we never met. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And so we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we stopped for three or four days, seeing relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Jeff had a --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And that would be -- you had a -- your father’s brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Yes, Benjamin, and I stayed with him overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And then -- after all, we were also late, because it was end of October, and this -- and the semester had already started, so we were already a month and a half late. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So we left New York to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> then we parted because, you see, both of us had no choice, we were not given a choice about what <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to go to Chicago, and in Chicago then we parted because, you see, both of us had no choice, we were not given a choice about what schools to attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We each told what we wanted to study and B’nai Brith then found the appropriate <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I was then sent to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> we said good-bye to each other, I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Champagne</span> , and he took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , because he went to <span class="REGION">Iowa State</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  And what are your memories of, the first impressions, of New York, of your uncle’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , of <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , of your uncle’s home, of Illinois?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Well, all right, they were distinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="439"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was of course something that only one saw in pictures, and in books, and still one had to -- to -- to really marvel at the c -- the- the -- the sorts of things tha-that were hard to even imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Taken to the automat for example, I mean, the idea of pushing a nickel and then being served a meal was -- you know, not only strange, but for -- for -- especially mechanically minded people like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">In <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> it was very different because, you know, I arrived there the night in -- on November the third or fourth of ’46. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">It happened to be the day before the semi -- the -- the biennial elections -- not presidential, but for two-thirds of the Senate, and the whole <span class="BUILDING">House of Representatives</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And -- and -- and -- you know, naively, and - and -- and I found out the following day that at that time, easily, about half of the people in the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> where I was being given <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board -- which was another thing that the B’nai Brith had arranged for me to do at the <span class="BUILDING">AEPi house</span> , the majority of them were veterans themselves, fliers, soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And then when I asked them are they voting tomorrow in the elections, and they said, “What elections?” </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I was -- it was the biggest, first initial shock in my life, because one in Europe associated political awareness and movement always with university students. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">That’s where also the ferment would take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And to -- to find out that the supreme indifference, and -- and a -- and e-eventually, this 1s -- became really, from -- from a critical thing, became an endearing aspect of American life, that I liked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  What is it they say, if all 1s going well, you don’t need to vote, but --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [indecipherable] or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Or -- or maybe the other thing that all politicians are -- are -- are -- are not worth paying attention to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  How difficult was your adjustment to life at -- that would be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Urbana</span> , Champagne. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I was just thinking of language, and then all the other adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Well, all right, language of course was really a bit of a problem, but it didn’t take me very long to -- to acquire language. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The nice thing a -- the ni -- the good aspect -- not the good, the -- the -- the tolerable aspect was that for engineering, really language was not that essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Or at least a very strong component. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Some of the first courses one had to take, which first of all amazed me, was that I had to take, you know, algebra. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Algebra. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I had gone to a special high school in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in -- in Greece, preparatory to entering the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">What is -- algebra was already a foregone thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And in fact, the first day I got to -- to that class, and I’m sitting there, and -- and -- and I see the instructor laboring over a formula, and -- and -- and very diffidently I asked if I could show another way, and I went, and then I showed the solution, and afterwards, at the end of the session, he asked me to stay back, and he said he knew about my arrival, and he knew that I was -- I came from Europe and education was stronger there, and he asked me not to come back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He says, “Ill give you an A, don’t show up in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So I was able to overcome that. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So I -- I believe that -- that I had some facility for languages, and so it didn’t become that much of an obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  What -- what were the most difficult areas of adjustment? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I mean, were there -- were there cultural things that were hard? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I mean, were you nostalgic for Greek food, did you miss your friends and family badly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Really, I must a-admit that -- that -- that except for occasional bouts of -- not loneliness, of not really being with a relative or a friend, but there was so much to absorb from every <span class="NPIP">aspect</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Life in it’s little ins -- insignificant a-aspects, wa -- the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , university life. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Life in a <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> , what young people did, what interested them. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It is -- it was so -- so -- there was practically no time to really begin to feel any deprivation at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The first time that happened was at the end of the first year, when suddenly the summer vacation [indecipherable] what am I gonna do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  And you were 20 then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I really went to New York, and stayed with my uncle, and I was working in his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and stayed with my uncle, and I was working in his factory, he was a manufacturer of dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Well, when the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B’nai Brith</span> found out that that’s what I was doing, they were horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So then they arranged for me to go to a special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was run by the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They had six or seven of them around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but typically what it would be, the Quakers -- the Friends -- the American Friends Service Committee would invite f -- foreign students, about 35 to 40, put them in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , usually a -- a private school, the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> for a private school that -- since it was vacation time, and we would stay there for almost eight weeks, and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs, and things like this, and we had every week some prominent individual from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , a professor would come, or -- either of political science, or psychology, and he would lecture, and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , the grounds for a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> that -- since it was vacation time, and we would stay there for almost eight weeks, and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs, and things like this, and we had every week some prominent individual from the university, a professor would come, or -- either of political science, or psychology, and he would lecture, and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">You know, kind of a thing and exchange ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then of course, play games, go swimming, and things like this, and that’s -- that’s how tha -- th-th -- it was a first time when I suddenly found myself almost detached because the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the fraternity house closed, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="BUILDING">fraternity house</span> closed, school was closed, I was going to go to <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And that’s the first time that it hit me that now I’m again alone and on my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  What was your fraternity experience like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Well, since I had no -- I had a brief semester which I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic</span> and still living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I -- I don’t want to say it was strange, or -- or -- everything was strange for me, everything was new, and I had nothing to compare -- of course I had then, eventually a -- other schoolmates who didn’t live in <span class="BUILDING">fraternities</span> , who lived in <span class="BUILDING">dorms</span> , or who lived in -- in <span class="BUILDING">rooming houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">What -- what I found -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">This is tape number two, side B. What was the fraternity experience like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, I guess, since it was all new, I had to -- to absorb and ac -- and sort of accept, because I had no other frame of reference against which to compare. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The only thing that certainly was a bit peculiar, at least to me, was that so much time was spent in -- in games, and recreation, as compared to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But even within this type of environment, one was not obligated to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I mean, there were certain events that one had to participate in, but what one did with one’s free time, it was up to individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So again it was -- 1t was a very good introduction to an aspect of American life, namely that you don’t have to conform to exactly a particular pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It was some of it you had to do, some of it was entirely voluntary. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I -- I know that there were some fraternity brothers who were Americans, and who, like me, did not participate in all the games, and superficial other activities, and who were much more serious in studies, and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  It would have given you acceptance by a group, and I wondered if that was a very good feeling for a newcomer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes, and again, since I have no other way to compare it, I would have to ask myself where if I had simply had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in it, or -- or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> , or -- or -- or ina <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> , would I be able to, al-almost in one fell swoop, be a brother to f -- to 40 or 50 other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I-It wouldn’t have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Yeah, it seems to me it was interesting that that was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  And I wondered too, when you were later in the U.S. army, years later, were there any similarities with your fraternity days? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I -- I was just simply thinking of group acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  None, none. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Of course, there -- there is a similarity, you know, whenever groups of people do similar things together, there are ties and camaraderies, and of course I leave out a big -- I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , that’s a different story, and participated in an action, and so forth, but in the American army I was not in any battle situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Because there is a special ties that get formed when people share dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">In the army, what was shared in the beginning was, during basic training, where you undergo a mixture of both discipline that 1s -- has some meaning, and a lot of mindless nonsense, which has even particular words in the -- in American army that we will not mention now in -- you know, the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Now, what fraternity was it, and what were the usual characteristics of that fraternity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  All right, the fraternity was called AEPi, Alpha Epsilon Pi. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was a Jewish fraternity, one of about, if I recall at that time, either five or six Jewish fraternities on the <span class="BUILDING">Champagne Urbana campus</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  And -- and most of, I think of the 40 or 50 individuals, me -- students at that time, I think 90 percent were residents of <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> from various parts, mostly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And the rest were really from practically other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , there were three or four New Yorkers, one from -- two from outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And obviously I was -- I was the only -- the only foreigner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Did you experience any anti-Semitism on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> in general, or in those years? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Were you a -- aware of any”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  None. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">None.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  Tell me more then -- let’s go on to your -- your studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Y -- it seems your adjustment was very straightforward. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">You did your first degree, and you stayed on at <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> for your later degrees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Right, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">After finishing the Bachelor’s degree, 1 -- it coincided with the advent of the Korean war, 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">When I got my Bachelor’s degree, then that summer, the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">A -- a number of friends and so forth, who thought they were be of imminent draftable age, did a number of things, including going to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> which they never thought or intended to go, in order to get deferments. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Other even went to the length of quickly getting married, so they would be supporters of family. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And then I -- I was told that I would be given a -- an assistanceship, a research assistanceship to continue to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , which then enabled me to go through the Master’s degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Then I decided to continue on for the doctorate. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And I went for the additional year, including then taking the oral exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And the oral exams were -- were- took place on June third, 1953, the date of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So I passed the oral. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So what was left to d -- to -- to do was to write the thesis, and in fact my advisor and I had selected the topic, but I had run out of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And there was no- the assist-assistanceship funding was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So it was a question of how I mi -- a -- going to be able to support myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My professor had arranged for me -- my advisor to work for the summer at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Telephone Laboratories</span> , just for the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And then, after taking the orals, I was offered a permanent position at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Well, I talked to my professor, and he said, “All right, it’s a little -- rarely done, but it can be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You can arrange for to write the thesis in absentia.” </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Which was the plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Unfortunately I was drafted a year later, and -- although after my release from the army, I intended to continue on -- to try to -- to write the thesis by -- in the meantime, at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> , they stopped allowing thesis to be written in absentia, because of pressure from the legislature. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And that sort of put an end to -- to that quest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Yeah, what did you write your thesis on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  What I was going to write the thesis on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Well, yeah what -- what were you planning earlier, to write it on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Well, the topic we had selected was this, the realization of electrical networks, with real components.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  And did you work -- I mean, wa-was that an <span class="REGION">area</span> you pursued in your work later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  A little bit, because since I was drafted, less tha -- in about a year after my starting arm -- permanent position at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> , there was a two year a -- in -- almost two years intervening in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">When I returned, I changed departments, and I joined a completely brand new department, which really was going to, and did the work in -- in -- in the totally new generation of telephone exchanges, digital instead of the older variety. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Which almost had nothing to do whatsoever with any of the special academic interests that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was -- it was a new universe, essentially of computers, and that’s what to -- got me into that <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Going back to the army, now had you become an American citizen earlier? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You came here as a Yugoslav.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">This is something that we have not covered at all because it was not covered in the earlier interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">While I -- I was studying for the orals, in April of 40 thre -- 40- of °53, my landlady tells me that somebody’s -- wants to talk to me, a gentleman appears, hands me a letter, I open it up, it’s from the immigration naturalization service, I’m to depart <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> within two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He says, “Look, I’m only the messenger.” </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Well, you can understand my state of mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> where I had friends, told them the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The long and the short is they intervened. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I mean, they got me to talk to a congressman, who then talked to the immigration department, immigration department renewed my stay for another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I thought that was going to be the end of that, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Without my knowing -- I had told one of my professors what had happened , and while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and even after my return two or three days later, without my knowing, four professors wrote to the then Senator Dograss of <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , who introduced a private bill in congress, and eventually became a law, known as the law for the relief of Isaac Ne-Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was signed by President Eisenhower, and by law I became a -- I was accepted as an immigrant, outside of the student visa restrictions, because student visa is a restricted class, where you are not allowed to -- to stay permanently. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So I was now, because of the special bill, I was now a special -- a -- a -- an immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So I would have to wait for my five years, you know, to be -- to gain citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But being inducted into the army, automatically within six months, then you become a citizen, for the very obvious reason that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> cannot ask you to defend it, and at the same time not recognizing you as a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  So I became a naturalized citizen in Colorado Springs, <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colorado Springs</span> , Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  Yeah, now -- and they intervened on your behalf with that private legislation, just you were a promising student, and they felt it was an injustice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  Yes, I’m -- I’m eve -- I’m very embarrassed to read the -- because I was investigated by the FBI, I mean, they had to go and interview them, and the glowing terms, I mean, make me blush even today when I read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  And then after serving in the army, you returned to Bell Labs, and continued to work in this exciting new <span class="DLF">field</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bell Labs</span> , and continued to work in this exciting new field?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- a personal aspect of my life is that it -- that just before I went in the army, I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">In fact, I lived with my first wife in Colorado Springs, because after basic training in New Jersey, I was then sent to the fifth army’s headq -- <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colorado Springs</span> , because after basic training in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , I was then sent to the fifth army’s headq -- school -- <span class="BUILDING">signal school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colorado Springs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And since in the army it’s very important- Or even more important what you don’t do, than what you do, instead of cleaning pots or -- or -- or being in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , I was teaching in the <span class="BUILDING">signal school</span> , reserve officers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio, telephony, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So that’s where I spent my -- my two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Upon our return then, to <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , I resumed my work at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> , but then there was a -- arift, and in 1957, I was divorced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Tell me about your first wife, what was her name and her background, and where you met, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  Her name was Ann Greenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I -- I -- I -- two summers -- after the first summer I mentioned to you earlier, with the Quaker camp, I worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poconos</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quaker camp</span> , I worked in the Poconos in a camp for boys and girls, as a waiter, to earn pocket money. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And was very often sufficient to- to -- to allow me to buy a -- an occasional movie ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Because the scholarship just simply provided <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But then I had a friend and when finally I wa -- began to start working at Bell Laboratories stationed in New York City, then this friend that I had met in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , then this friend that I had met in the camp told me about a young lady who was an -- an -- a friend of hers, and that’s how I -- I met Ann. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And so we were going out together, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for training, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own parents were divorced, it was a -- arather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I maybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you know, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But she was persuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it [indecipherable] allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The long and the short is we -- we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Colorado Springs, at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colorado Springs</span> , at the university because she eventually intended to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at <span class="BUILDING">NYU</span> <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , she enrolled at NYU. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And she was -- began to have problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">First of all, academic problems, and then one day she disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The long and the short is I found out through a physician who was -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a schizophrenic. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And he -- who -- and this -- this man urged me to simply get away as fast as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I was -- my reaction was, you know, “You’re just telling me that I’m dealing with a sick person, and you’re telling me to abandon a sick person?” </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But he convinced me that it’s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it would have been almost an impossibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The long and the short is that I got a quick divorce in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It was consensual, it wasn’t contested or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That’s what happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  W -- y -- in your years with <span class="BUILDING">Bell Labs</span> , I’m sure there were particular successes, and difficulties, and -- I mean, how do you look back on those years, and what would you have us know”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  All right, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe the Bell system. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We used to refer to 1 -- 1 -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So one can conjure up a -- an older woman, rather buxom, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Warm, that you feel warm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Well, in other words, 1t was a magnificent preparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of extreme capability. </span><span class="sentence" id="608"><span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> recruited only the upper one percent of graduates in <span class="BUILDING">American universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn’t really make it through with hot air, you would be found out right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So it was a -- a very, very demanding -- well, not demanding, but -- but really very mar-marvelous preparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">By the same token, it was a -- an extremely inbred thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">We -- we thought collectively that we knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And -- so in -- there was a little bit of a struggle because there was no formal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">My dreams always were that when I started my career, I would be taken under the wing of an experienced person who would take me slowly through the -- and it didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It isn’t that I didn’t learn things from colleagues, I did, a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But there was no former -- you were essentially left on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And there came times I think almost three or four weeks after I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck under false pretenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That -- that I wasn’t doing anything valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But I very quickly got over that, because I began to do serious things. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And then I got drafted, and I return, a-and -- and then it happened that we were working on the first field trial of this first ever new telephone exchange, what has taken Bell Laboratories biggest department of 400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modess</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> biggest department of 400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And I started the -- the -- the system, and I came to the conclusion that it will not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Not - not that it will not work, that it -- it would not accommodate the kind of capacity that it was aimed to, something like 20,000 or 40,000 subscribers. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">My analysis showed that it would barely make it for 2000 subscribers. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Well, it was solid enough thing that my own supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a presentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And of course the first reaction was one of horrible shock and -- and -- and -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a -- immediately a rising star. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I was almost, I think, thrown out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and within a week I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really wanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand Corporation in <span class="REGION">California</span> , where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke, really to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people who had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start an effort, and I wanted to be a participant there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">When I got there, simply the -- the plans were totally different, never as I said, and that experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rand</span> was, in itself of a different kind, but equally rewarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Your --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And how long did you stay with Rand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  I stayed for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Then one f -- day I got a call from my former boss at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> , who was ready to retire, and who told me that the Bell system had been asked by the government to assist the government in the Apollo program. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And he was simply asking me where I would talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And he asked me not to hang up on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I said, “I respect you too much to do that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The long and the short 1s they -- and I’m talking about -- I -- but I don’t know anything about rockets is what -- I don’t know either, and I’m -- I’m 65 and I’m willing to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The long and the short 1s that -- do you want to hear a interesting story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  All right, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I -- because I had a lot of leave coming, I flew to east, I spoke to them, I came back, I spoke with Paulette, and I decided to reject their offer, that I was happy what I was doing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">That was a weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">On Monday I go back to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at Rand, and the telephone rings, and it’s the secretary of the president of the Rand corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">She says, “Frank Wright to see you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I had met him once. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">What’s the president to do with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I go to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he greets me, he says, “I -- I understand you’re considering leaving us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I was, you know, f -- absolutely -- you know, and it showed in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">H-He saw it, he says, “W-W-Wait,” he said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="648">it isn’t anything nefarious, we don’t have a -- a secret police. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It’s very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Julian West,” who was the vice president at <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> with whom I had talked to that previous day or two, “is a West Point classmate of mind, and he called me, he told me that they want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And so what do you think you are doing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So I told him, “I’m going to stay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He said, “Fantastic.” </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I sit down, “What are you doing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He said, “And what do you think of the Apollo program?” </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So I began to say, “Well, this is probably the biggest thing since the building of the <span class="DLF">pyramids</span> , the greatest,” -- so I didn’t know that he was almost setting a -- a -- a trap, and I was waxing so eloquently about, you know, going to the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Then he said, “I -- I th -- I think like you do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He says, “Let m -- let me tell you -- let’s do the following,” he says. ““</span><span class="sentence" id="660">Why don’t you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Within -- because if you don’t, you may regret it later that you didn’t participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But you go, and within two or three months, you will know whether it’s really s-suits you. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">If 1t doesn’t, come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There’|l always be a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you here.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="665">What a wise individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So I -- I --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  An inter -- it is an interesting story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I -- I didn’t return.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  So that you then continued to work on the Apollo program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Yes, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Oh, well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s why we came to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  Well tell me for how long you worked on it, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, from 1962, till 1968. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And this is at what -- at that point where already the plans for Apollo already had matured. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">My department -- I was head of one of the five departments in the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We were already beginning to think about voyages to <span class="NPIP">Mars</span> , believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But another opportunity o -- arose. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">A friend of this boss of mine, who re -- who attracted me back to the -- to -- to the Bell system, then had a -- a- a wealthy individual friend who lived in f -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and who was willing to fund new <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And the long and the short is that I left the Bell system, and I founded my own company.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  This is very fascinating, I thought you’d had a career, you know, an unbroken career with <span class="BUILDING">Bell Lab</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  And this would have been a very exciting time with the Apollo program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Yes, it’s an unmistakable time because I don’t -- it ha -- is -- 1t has been studied, it has been written up, namely how so much enthusiasm, because fo -- you could see -- and I traveled a great deal, because this program was all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we didn’t think about nine to five, or working hours, weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The enthusiasm there, of going and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The enthusiasm was -- was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It has not been replicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But if I may tell you that things like this have occurred, and I can assure you that I have not really been an instrument in choosing the situations, but throughout my career, <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> , the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand Corporation artificial intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">In other words, what I’m trying to emphasize is that these things occur both in <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> as well as 1n -- even in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , very rarely, where you undertake something where there is no precedent. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Because when you are in situations like this, then ideas flow freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">When you are in a -- 1n a environment with a lot of tradition, and you say, “Well, what about this thing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Then they’ll say, “Look, we ve tried that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Or, “We don’t do things like this around here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="693">When you are in a new situation, then all ideas are given free reign. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Now, all of them are not equally good, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in, but even <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> don’t have the luxury of pursuing two or three <span class="DLF">avenues</span> in parallel. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it’s the -- it’s -- it’s almost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don’t know what smoking pot or any of these things would be, but it’s -- I remember the early 50’s in the <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Unless you are either under narcosis or an utter idiot, you couldn’t help but stumble on new inventions, on new ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was a kind of a ferment that occurs very, very infrequently in the lives of <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> , or the survivors in -- in even the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Somehow it occurred two or three times 1n my career. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">None because I chose them like this, just pure luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Yeah, so you’ve been very privileged --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  -- to be in these sort of intellectually exciting --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  -- <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Now, when you would be with the Apollo program, how would that fit with Sputnik? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I mean that -- Sputnik would have happened, and have --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh yeah, [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- Kennedy, yes, and -- and we would have been sort of fast and furiously pursuing space flight --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  -- just at the time you’d be -- yeah, well --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- you’d be working on part of that program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  Well, Apollo was -- was -- was -- was done on purpose by the Kennedy speech in Congress --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  -- to send a man to the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The fact that it was done not so much in response to Sputnik alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I mean, we were pursuing manned space flight. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">The Russians beat us by a year, but as events eventually showed, really, eventually the a -- the American technological superiority is what made -- made the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  Yeah, and a -- but -- was it -- well, I was just thinking of reading about someone named James Webb, I think, who --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, James Webb, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">James Webb was the -- the -- the first administrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">A very funny thing I will tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Of na -- of -- of NASA.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Of NASA, oh -- NASA. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He was a very ki -- a -- he was primarily a -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">This is tape number three, side A. We were talking about Kennedy’s America space program, and James Webb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  Right, James Webb, who was the first and really strongest NASA administrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">But there -- there’s a vignette about Webb which I think that you’ll find amusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Around 1954, he was interviewed by the New York Times, and there were many questions, and one of the questions he was asked was phrased as follows, he said -- he was -- he was told, “Mr. Webb, it’s been said that the Russian space program 1s a very methodical program, you know, because they had started with a manned thing, then you send one individual, then a woman, then two. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">How would you characterize the American program?” </span><span class="sentence" id="723">He said, “Our program is just as methodical, if not more so than the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Every step we take depends on the next.” </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And that’s Mr. Webb, all right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  Yeah, that was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Now, you formed your own company at -- in what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was 1968. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">My revered, late, former boss Dr. Lovell, a prominent man, inventor with 300 patents to his name, prolific individual, and extremely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">He told me one day that his friend was looking to fund a starting company, was I -- was I interested? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I really didn’t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get into the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But very quickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">The first one was that my former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing the work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of course, situated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , that’s what brought us from <span class="REGION">California</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He also had, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief executive of another company. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he called me on the phone one day, and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">That is to say those systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and bet. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">totes</span> , as they were called, it’s also the same name in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , from tote boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And we -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So we thought that 1t was going to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It turned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and - and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it right, they said, “Well, why don’t you do it for us?” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And the long and the short is, and what made my company was the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We -- we build the first computerized systems in the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation because we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play, primarily as laboratory instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">No -- no such animal had ever been used in a very, not only real life situation, but betting 1s a very, very technologically demanding situation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting’s taking place, the number of transactions is very, very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And so the system had to, you know, keep up with the flow thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  Now when you said <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mini-computers</span> , would -- I mean, how small would they be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Well, a -- a mini-computer, the type that we used, would be about the size of a -- let’s say an audio tape, no not -- not that small, but one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mini-computer</span> , the type that we used, would be about the size of a -- let’s say an audio tape, no not -- not that small, but one of the units that you see on my shelf, possibly, let’s say 20 inches wide, maybe 20 inches high, and about the same depth. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But as I said, they had very limited memory, and they were used only, principally at the time, tentatively as laboratory instruments to collect data on experiments and things like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  And what did -- what was your company called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  It was called International Computing Company. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">My f -- boss, the man who eventually engaged me asked me why that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I said, “Well, it would be too ambitious to call it intergalactic, so I -- I chose International Computing Company.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And then it was really venture capital behind you initially?</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  The horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  The horses, gave us enough staying power. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Also our -- actually our first contract that we won two months after our formation, was to win a -- a program funded by the nat -- National Institutes of Health, to try to see whether computers could be used in assisting the collection and dissemination of blood in <span class="BUILDING">blood banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And we were allied in this particular contract with the -- the blood bank in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> , in <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> <span class="BUILDING">blood bank</span> in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And it lasted for two years, and we were able to prove that indeed, because it’s the -- a problem of s -- not -- o-of -- of -- of inventory, because as you know, blood has a short lifetime of three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So, it had -- computers were -- what we were able to do, ina real life situation, because the Milwaukee blood center supplied about 23 <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in the greater Milwaukee area -- the secret is the ability of the Milwaukee blood center -- all information if a blood unit is wanted, of a particular type in one <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the computer knew it was in another <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is to transport it, sometimes even with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxicab</span> <span class="BUILDING">Milwaukee blood center</span> supplied about 23 hospitals in the <span class="REGION">greater Milwaukee area</span> -- the secret is the ability of the <span class="BUILDING">Milwaukee blood center</span> -- all information if a blood unit is wanted, of a particular type in one hospital, and the computer knew it was in another hospital is to transport it, sometimes even with a taxicab. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">By contrast, the Red Cross, who was the -- and still is the biggest collector of blood -- privately I think it’s a national disgrace, because the Red Cross doesn’t, once it collects a unit of blood, if 1t then ships it to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , it’s responsibilities end there. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Now the unit may eventually age, and then be thrown down the <span class="DLF">drain</span> , but in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> we -- we did not allow that, because we were able to, if something was needed, then we could -- had enough authority because the <span class="BUILDING">Milwaukee blood center</span> still owned the blood unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  But the long and the short of ICC was that after the horses, then we got involved in satellite communications. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And I can tell you -- perhaps you know enough about computers to know that computers really don’t care whether you’re dealing with blood, or -- or horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It’s information that you are -- are -- are exchanging, so very -- when we got into satellite communications, we bodily lifted elements of software from the racetrack systems into satellite communications. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And you tell that to people who don’t understand, they say, “Well, how can that be?” </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Well, [indecipherable] understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  Yeah, the horses paid for your knowledge that could be applied to other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  Right, and made -- made -- made the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And -- and by -- by ni -- ni -- 1987, and that was about 11 or 12 years after our formation, we had reached a force of about a hundred to 120 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And then we became -- we were courted by a number of big corporations. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Eventually a company called Contel, Continental Telephone, cause it was the third largest telephone company in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , bought us. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And in a sense this was [indecipherable] completing the circle for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I started my career in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">telephone company</span> , and eventually gets bought out by another <span class="BUILDING">telephone company</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Yeah, oh do, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  Oh, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Well we’re -- it was February, and I picked him up from the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and we are getting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span> , we are driving, we are talking in French, primarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He was not that comfortable in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">At some point, about an hour -- it’s about a three hour drive, he was telling me that he had been suffering from stomach problems, and his wife Vera, a magnificent Russian grand dame, was from time to time su -- supporting him, he said, “Yeah, yeah, oh she’s been very, very sick at times.” </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But at some point he said, “Look, I -- I’m -- I’m feeling some pains now, would you ask the driver to stop at the next <span class="BUILDING">gas station</span> , because I have a thermos bottle with milk in my valise, and I need to,” -- of course, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So we stopped, and we opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , and -- and -- and opened the valise, the driver and I were on the side, and we saw Stravinsky opening the thermos, pouring something, and drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And after awhile he says, “Everything is fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and there was an unmistakable strong smell of Scotch whiskey. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So, when about an hour later he said he had pains again, we understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">This way I met, you know, people like Stravinsky, and Stern, and -- and Metropolus, and Zell. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Because I would go pick them up, and then we would always ask them, and in many cases they all did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">The only reward that we students had, about eight, 10 of us, for all the work was to be -- to have dinner after the concert with the visiting artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">That was, you know --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  Yeah, and was that something that was -- meant a great deal to your parents, and their parents before them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  Well, my father used to play the mandolin, and he at times would play, but mostly th-this work -- what, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> and Sephardic culture, are called canteegass, from the Spanish word, which are -- believe ballads, although there are differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Ballads tell a story, canteegass mostly are usually about a love affair, or -- or one thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But it wasn’t that they were s-so musically. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We didn’t have -- we had a -- a radio, but it wasn’t a musical thing, but in the whole process of -- of being well rounded, then I was sent to the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and I took classes 1n the violin, until ’41 when also again because of the occupation, the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> closed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  -- about Urbana Champagne --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  -- and -- and -- and music, but were there other things going on in those <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> years which were important, and tie in in some way with your -- your background? </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I -- I was wondering what was happening politically in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> then, and would there be much involvement at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  The only thing that I recall distinctly -- and it didn’t touch me personally, but in fact the director of the school of music, Dr. Kyper -- in fact, the summer of graduation, I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Champagne</span> to retrieve a couple of personal belongings, and on the return - he was there, it was July, so I was -- it was a little strange to see Dr. Kyper in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="BUILDING">school of music</span> , Dr. Kyper -- in fact, the summer of graduation, I returned to Champagne to retrieve a couple of personal belongings, and on the return - he was there, it was July, so I was -- it was a little strange to see Dr. Kyper in the train. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We sat together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">observation lounge</span> , and he proceeded ga -- I -- I could see that he was very troubled, and I felt both honored, and in the same time, it’s a bit uncomfortable, because Dr. Kyper unloaded, or -- or told me, or related to me, the reason he has come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And this it was simply that because of the McCarthy era, perhaps he had connections with leftist groups in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">But essentially he had been sort of recalled from vacation by the president of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and told that there were such suspicions, or accusations, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">The [indecipherable] fact was that he was dismissed from the di -- the directorship of the <span class="BUILDING">school of music</span> , but remained as a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And he was a -- a -- a first kind of personal contact with a political atmosphere at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">This is the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I mean, after I went in the army and so forth, well then I -- I was always politically interested, I -- because I remember, my first recollections as a -- as a boy, because my- both my parents were extremely interested 1n political things and we used to discuss it, but my first political awareness was the Spanish civil war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">No, I -- I would have expected that because of your background, you’d have a particular sensitivity to the McCarthy era. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Just -- really just you’d experience the pre -- well, you know, you’d experienced the Holocaust, and so you understood that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Sure, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Well, not only the Holocaust, but -- but even the [indecipherable] all of these things, and the reading, and all the thinking, and it was a kind of a strange thing to be living those days in the United States, who -- f-for us in the liberation -- the United States and it’s history was something so unique, so superior to anything else, that at the beginning, you know, I found it really hard to reconcile how in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , who -- f-for us in the liberation -- the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and it’s history was something so unique, so superior to anything else, that at the beginning, you know, I found it really hard to reconcile how in the same place that -- that -- where there was so much freedom of expression, everything else, there was also something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Except that a little bit of understanding of what had happened in the 30’s in central Europe, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> , in Germany, then s -- I began to -- to realize that there wa -- there was no monopoly, and it could happen anywhere, and it had begun to even infest the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Yes, and I would think to see -- to have that insight that -- perhaps to appreciate the danger it posed before many Americans would.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  You had referred to your -- to y -- to your wife, Paulette in the -- as we spoke about your -- your corporate years, so let’s -- le-let’s return now to that part of your family life, and tell me how you met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Well, we go back, remember I was divorced 1n 57, and -- and again, this is another period that harks back when you were asking me, when I first came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did I feel lonely, or -- or nostalgic, which I hadn’t, but again in this stressful period, I had lots of friends, but really not relatives near me, that is to say people who, regardless of what you do, will always be on your side. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So I had nowhere to turn, and I -- I had to -- to cope with the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">In any case, the following summer, and coincidentally because Sam was getting married, then I decided that I needed a -- a change of scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">In fact at one point I -- I thought that perhaps I would go and -- and -- and live in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And in fact I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And I had been given names of a number of companies, including IBM, and believe me, it took just one interview to completely settle the issue for me, that the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me was the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So I then enjoyed my -- my vacation, and I didn’t think of ever st-staying in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  Yeah, let me -- let me ask two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Going back, what were the main stresses at that time, in 1957, which you mentioned before, but also -- and then -- then I’m eager to know what it was about that IBM interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">The stresses were strictly personal, the personal stresses of the divorce, of- of -- of all it’s -- 1t’s a-aftermath, and then finding myself alone, and -- and a little bit lost, and -- and wounded, the way that things had -- had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I -- I imagine it’s either romantic or -- or -- or -- or whatever you want to call it, to s -- to -- to -- to s -- really think that a change of scenery is what you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So that’s why then I said, “Oh, well, all right, let me look into the possibility of working overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So I contacted a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">When I went to 1 -- to <span class="BUILDING">IBM offices</span> , well they said, “Yeah, but you see we cannot hire you here, as an American, because that has all kinds of other ramifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We have to pay you extra salary, allow you return every year for vacation, and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">So that’s a totally different kettle of fish, you gotta be hired by <span class="BUILDING">IBM</span> there and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But if to hire you here, you have to be hired as a local.” </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And that meant a totally different situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">The moment I heard that, [ -- | -- I realized 1-it wasn’t going to be for me and I’m glad it -- that 1t occurred very quickly, because then I could enjoy the remaining two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Because I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> first, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> for Sam’s wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">This is where I met Paulette, I mean the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I mean she was in the <span class="DLF">receiving line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Then two days later, I got a call from her sister, whom I knew vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I had met her vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Her sister was having a few people for dinner, would I like to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So I’m walking, and -- and I’m reaching the -- the -- the <span class="DLF">block</span> where her sister lived, and at the <span class="DLF">door</span> is a young lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Well, we’re both waiting for the <span class="DLF">door</span> to open, we go, we get into the elevator, and we both realized that we stopped in the same <span class="DLF">door</span> , and we ring the bell, and of course, it opens up, Yola, her sister, opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They embraced. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I thought there was -- she was just another invitee, I had no idea of the relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And like an idiot, it was during, really, dinner when a conversation is going between them like Yola is asking Paulette, how are the folks? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I mean the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And then I said, naively, “Are you related?” </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They said, “We are sisters.” </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Well, so that was our first meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Then the following day, or I di -- two days later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that this was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with Isaac Stern, would I like to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I said, “Of course.” </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I had dinner with Isaac Stern during my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went backstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">He remembered me because we had dinner together with his accompanist Zagin. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And so we started going together, and within about a week, I proposed to her.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Now, as an observ -- as an outsider it would seem to me that this wa -- this marriage had lots of qualities that would make it a success, of -- her sort of coming from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , being Jewish and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Do you remember having any thoughts about what you -- what -- what qualities you wanted in a wife, or shared background? </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Was it important that she shared your faith, and things of that kind? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Or did it just happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  I think it just happened, but really in -- in -- in -- in my own personal case, you -- you have t -- to also take into account that even at the time I went in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , I was still living possibly in the tail end, fortunately, of my experience, the first marriage, which had ended so -- so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Really, I think that -- 1t’s one of the questions that I think I saw in your notes, about religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There 1s a woman named Jane Gerber, you know her work. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">| -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> in July, which I will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral where they have some artifacts that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> <span class="BUILDING">National Cathedral</span> where they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Wonderful lecture she gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in response to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the Sephardim towards religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And this is as best I can also describe both my religious upbringing, which was not very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I mean, we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Dietary laws are really almost impossible to apply in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , because there were 3000 Jews in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of a million. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">There -- y-y -- there wasn’t a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to -- to go buy kosher meat and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But in the high holidays, then special arrangements were made for s -- special slaughterers to come, and to provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">So there were no -- there was -- when I -- there were never crustaceans in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">But the observances there, we were -- my job for example, every Friday from the age of five or six, because the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was only about a block away from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , was to carry the oil donation to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , because the Sephardim didn’t burn candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">All the -- the lights were olive oil with wicks in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Sabbath, and of course, all the major holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And the -- the -- the prepara -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>

<p>ANSWER:  Continue in that vein, so -- from a totally different thing, there is a -- a Greek saying that it’s better to -- to wear old shoes from your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , even if they are -- have been repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">But again, I didn’t got there to -- to -- to find a -- a wife, it just -- it just happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  And, of course I’m -- I’m -- I’m glad that there was some commonality, first in another language, to some shared experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Paulette was too young, she was -- she was only 33, and at the time of the hiding, she was barely nine or 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So she doesn’t have as vivid memories of -- I mean, she has vivid memories of the hiding, but I mean nothing compared to going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And also, very fortunately, none of her relatives perished in -- in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">ANSWER:  One of her uncles also happened to be a Spanish citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but he survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Now, does she remember being in hiding, though, her -- her family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Not only that, but she was able a few years ago, I think four or five years ago, to re-establish contact with the daughters of the family that hid them. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And in fact one of them was visiting a sister in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and then came and stayed with us for -- for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So she has maintained this thing, and she has extremely strong recollections, because also, there -- there came a time when in maybe not the first, but the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were hiding, somebody already told them, there’re already suspicions that you me -- may be Jews, and that was a signal to- for them to immediately leave and go someplace else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  See, she remembers all of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Tell me about your children.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  Right, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">QUESTION:  How did both you and Paulette decide to raise the girls? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I’m thinking of bringing them up to -- I mean, did you attend -- did they attend <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , did they have Bat Mitzvahs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">QUESTION:  Did you share openly your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  No, the -- we -- I -- look, 1 -- living in aside what I referred to earlier, Gerber’s phrase of the relaxed atmosphere, but I mean both at <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and -- and -- and when I began to mature a little bit more, I am not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But some of the things we retained which were dear to me, primarily because it brought memories of the family and it’s tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So we always had the lighting of candles in Hanukkah, and the high holidays we -- we used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But I did not insist on their going to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , or -- or -- or this or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">It’s -- it’s turned out that of the three, entirely spontaneously, Nicole is the one who is super Jewish than all the other -- all -- all the -- the daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I think really if I think now in retrospect, I think the division of labor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured from a social standpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I mean, in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , for instance, we never celebrated birthdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">It was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I don’t even know my father’s birthday, my mother’s birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">The only reason I know my birthday, and my brother’s is because I -- we have records from -- birth certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But in those days, they did -- they did -- but so from the social upbringing, this was sort of Paulette’s area. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">In my case, I think that I co- I continue to try to inculcate the same things that I received from my parents, you know, the tremendous reverence for -- for education and -- and -- and learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Plus I think something else, one other thing, it was -- this -- how can I phrase it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">The -- the -- the a -- assuming of personal responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I remember that in the case of all three girls, when they were ready to now leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , Maya- Sarah going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , Maya in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , and Nicole in <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> , I took them all for a -- a long ride and lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And first of all, I told them about the fact that I had been married once before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And a -- a typically -- although they didn’t tell each other, because I asked them not to, they all -- always asked the same question, what was her name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And did by any chance have a sibling that they didn’t know? [</span><span class="sentence" id="1013">indecipherable] not -- no -- no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And then I told them that as they are ready now to go and -- and live their own lives, I told them that a part of the Hippocratic oath a doctors take, one part which I -- I -- I think it’s very important, is above all do no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  So Is -- I used to say to them, “Look, you may encounter all kinds of situations, all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">If you are asked to try something, whether it’s drugs, or si -- do the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">If you have any doubt about the possibility of doing harm, then don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">But whatever it 1s that you do, take personal responsibility for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Now, it will always be a -- a-- I mean, we will always be with you, no matter what happens,” but I tried in a number of little things that they used to do when -- when they were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">For instance, how they would divide a labor, chores, how they would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">It was always this aspect that -- and -- and although this got formalized really, after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , with existentialism, and when it was finally given a kind of official thing, that namely life is nothing but a -- a set of choices, and even not doing something 1s itself a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But even before I had read Sartre, and -- and -- and -- and the periodicals that I used to get from my cousin, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> [indecipherable] moderne, I always felt, and I think primarily the war years, because when I got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , then I knew that is- is nothing -- I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go f -- to assume responsibility for whatever I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">So that became something that’s -- I sort of learned on the job, as it were, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And I thought that 1t would be a very important and useful thing to -- to tell them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  Yeah, and had -- had they been growing up in a -- 1n a strictly observant <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , their guidance would have come from the sort of roles of their faith, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Yes, probably, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1029">QUESTION:  So it’s -- it’s --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [indecipherable] the ethical portion of the --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">ANSWER:  -- of the faith, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">You know, it’s -- what I would say, either by recounting personal examples or events in my life, the -- they were not meant really to be mini lessons in ethics, but simply that -- that I -- I trusted them enough -- I had differences with Paulette, really sometimes really severe ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Paulette would sometimes accuse me that I was too easy, that I -- she -- she -- she believed, and she still does that Sarah experimented with pot when she was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I tried to tell her that -- that all I tried to do, and all I think a -- a parent can do, is to make sure that the core of the person is solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Since I could not be on top of them in every <span class="NPIP">place</span> they went, I could only concentrated in one pronouncement, do whatever you want, but be responsible for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Fortunately they have all turn out to be magnificent persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">ANSWER:  Very different in many, many respects, but all of them quite good --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  -- and solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  I wondered if there’s any -- wh-when we referred to Jane Gerber earlier, and I was reading something that spoke about this Sephardim psyche, which I -- I jotted down, but I wonder if there is -- I wonder if you think there are any built in differences of attitudes that Sephardim might have, because they really have wandered so widely, through centuries of history, and -- and faced all sorts of upheavals, and -- I don’t know if there are people that are more resilient, less trusting, I have -- I -- I just wonder if there -- if anything comes to mind that’s worth discussing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And -- and if you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well -- well, it may be, but I think that it again depended on individual <span class="BUILDING">households</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">What I can say that comes a little close to -- to -- to what you’re alluding to, was my mother telling me about some -- for example, because her maiden name was Colonomos, which, as you probably know -- who knows if there is any connection, but one of the most famous rabbis of all time, not s-so much Sephardim, a [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">Ashkenazis Germany</span> was a Colonomos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And as you know the name means -- it has some variance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">The -- the basic variant is Colonimos, which in Greek means, of good name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And it’s Hebrew equivalent is yom -- what’s the name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Not -- yom -- yom -- Yomkesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">So, th-there -- people who are called like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Now, why was she doing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Apparently there must have been a kind of tradition that was primarily oral -- again, through the ballads, and through the songs, that hark back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">After all, of the five <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , major <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , before the catastrophe, one was Kal Aragon, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aragon</span> <span class="BUILDING">Kal Aragon</span> , the synagogue of -- from Aragon, the other was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kal Portugas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">So there was really in -- in the stories that they would say, and even sometimes I -- you know, I- yo-you -- if I chance to read a -- a play of Calderone’s, and you see phrases which are not longer existing in -- in modern Spanish, and I can hear my grandmother pronounce it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Some of that was there, but 1t was not something that was cultivated so much, except simply in the oral tradition about how things were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , how they dressed for holidays, how they ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So I don’t know if it 1s really what you -- you refer to as psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , because of a stronger movement, and the fact that -- that -- that there was a lot more contact with other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> because of commerce, and in inismeer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , there was much more of an intellectual fermented than there was in the monastileese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">There is a mystique about monastileese that to this day I don’t know why it’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">In fact, a week or so ago, we went to an annual meeting on monastileese, which is a group of 60 people in -- in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that it’s a bureel society, they simply are descendants of a first congregation of monastileese ever established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It doesn’t exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">It’s called the Congregation of Peace and Brotherhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But they continue --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Their sort of proud tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  Yeah, so there is, yeah, there is -- 1f you could see, I mean you go on the web, and you -- Monasteer, when it comes -- [indecipherable] has his own website, the Sephardic four, full of things again about -- Sephardic things, dishes, cooking, traditions, names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I mean, you -- names which were strange names sometimes, very Spanish in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Then strange mixes of Hebrew names, women, Soonho, which in Hebrew is Allegra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And then you see from -- from generation to generation how things we [indecipherable] change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">My mater -- paternal grandmother’s name was Estraya -- Star, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">But as is traditional in Jewish fa -- Sephardic families, the eldest daughter, firstborn on the paternal side -- I mean born, takes the name of the paternal mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And the boy -- that’s why I’m named after my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And -- and -- an-and -- now that’s -- [indecipherable] it was through the work that I’d done for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that I -- and some other things, that I found that my great-great grandfather, Solomon, was one of the 13 signatories in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> in 1864 for the bringing of the alliance fran¢aise in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">QUESTION:  -- stable parents, with a shared -- to some degree a shared heritage, and -- and with a great deal of sort of, I would think, economic stability and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1071">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  But it’s wonderful that there’s gaps, I mean in I -- history over generations, it’s [indecipherable |</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Let me tell you what I regret, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">That there 1s practically no information about my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I have a cousin, first cousin, Miriam, who lives 1n -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she -- her -- her -- her mother and my mother were sisters, and she has done a lot of research on the Colonomus family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I finally have decided that it’s about time I asked Miriam to make as much of the connection -- the only thing I know about my mother was because she was an extremely bright student, and she went to a French school, and in that meeting just last weekend, I found another woman, whose mother, although in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> , and in that meeting just last weekend, I found another woman, whose mother, although in Salonika, also went to an alliance francais school, and she also was very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Both of them were slated to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for further training, but unfortunately the war intervened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">That’s -- stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But I remember even when I first came to the United States, landed in New York, and saw my aunt, and I met another friend of hers, not a relative now, but also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and saw my aunt, and I met another friend of hers, not a relative now, but also from Monasteer, and she says, “I remember your mother, she was so clever.”</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  That’s a -- that’s putting it very mildly, very mildly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">QUESTION:  -- but her own abilities would want -- want it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">ANSWER:  Yes, she was a very driven person, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">QUESTION:  We were speaking about your mother and her abilities and her ambitions for her sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">ANSWER:  Well yes, first th -- I mentioned earlier about the obligation to speak French at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Very frequently she would ask me to all -- give me assignments to read, books, French books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">In the beginning children’s stories, later on even plays of Racine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And I still remember she’s in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , maybe cooking something, and I would then read passages, or from some of -- of these plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Now some of them, and I still remember, included situations which really -- now, they were not erotic, but for instance I still remember -- although I knew the -- the word -- 1t comes from when it was -- it says -- he says elaparlay arsematress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Well, she did not comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Normally she would have expected me to ask, “Well, that does matress mean?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">You know, because matress has at least two meanings in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">One is a teacher, you know, or mistress, but mistress in the sense of hierarchy, and the other 1s the -- the lover connotation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So she was an avid reader herself, 1n the little time that she had available running the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , although- though we had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And she read history, and she -- 1-it was a -- ak -- a kind of a- of a situation where she -- she demanded, you know, excellence, and it was at times sometimes hard to know what her expectations were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">My father on the other hand was a lot more encouraging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">He had ways of recompense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">One of my earliest memories that I have to tell you, I was I think possibly barely -- four -- four and a half, and I had written from an assignment, you know, half a page. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And I showed it to him, and he was incredulous, he says, “You wrote that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I almost saw a -- a -- a look of disbelief, and he says, “Here, here, takes -- take another piece of paper.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">He sat down and he dictated a brand new passage from another book for me, and had me write it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So I finish that, he looked at it, he says, “What a magnificent handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">All right, put your things together, we’re going to go now to the <span class="BUILDING">patisserie</span> , and have a piece of cake.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So he had this nice thing about, you know, rewards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Wa -- my mother was not really that free with -- with praise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">She was always a lot more demanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  Yeah, but your father was very warm and loving, it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  Now, you s -- you’ve said different things in the earlier video interview that m- made me feel there was often tension with your mother, and I’m assuming that you, rather than Sam your brother, would be the one who would c-carry the burden of your mother’s ambitions for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But I -- I wondered if you’d talk a bit more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know if it’s something, you know, if -- I know even from my own experience with children, that by the time Maya was born, the second, one mellows, and -- and it becomes a different -- because obviously the first child has taught you how to become a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And I think that probably from either a character or personality strai -- trait, ’'m probably very much like my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I too, perfectionist, demanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Really I -- I cringe sometimes at being praised. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Which I know 1s a terrible defect, because it’s almost the obverse side of the coin of claming too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">If you always reject praise as -- as if -- you know, you’re asking for people to -- to continue doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there were tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And it isn’t that she neglected the other two, but I think, again, 1t was a question of mellowing, and -- and not asking as much from them as I did -- she did with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But on the other hand, especially in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her demands, and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">It’s -- it’s then that I began to realize how much what was, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self discipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something that you like, namely to go and find out things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And -- and the joy of discovering coutch sa -- doesn’t happen if you don’t -- 1f you don’t try. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And -- and you know that there are people I -- I know my youngest daughter began -- she had a -- she has perfect pitch, and began to even play tunes in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> when she was barely two, two and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And -- and later on -- I tell her sometimes, and she -- she rightly says it isn’t- wasn’t laziness, she had other things to interest her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So she didn’t pursue piano the way, you know, I thought that she -- she would from -- from that kind of promise in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">So similarly, what originally was a -- a compulsion, then I began to appreciate, and how much I owe her for what she eventually was able -- able to give me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">ANSWER:  The love of -- of -- of -- of -- of finding out, and -- and -- and looking at things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Except that she -- she -- she -- she had a sharp edges to doing that.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">QUESTION:  -- you know, you had the -- the balance, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1133">QUESTION:  But her relationship with Samuel might have been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Of course, you can never be in his shoes, but --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And because a-again, see, the 40’s was s-so different, and by the time that I think Sam also came of age to really start to doing more serious studies, going into the <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the war had intervened, and -- and that changed things considerably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And I -- I -- and it -- I don’t even by -- that -- tho -- the p -- the -- the occurrence of the war mellowed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It was merely that -- that already other <span class="NPIP">things</span> became very important, and by that time already, I had then hit my stride, and it was not necessary any more to be pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And she already could see, she had evidence that I had now taken --</p>

<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">This 1s tape number four, side A. We’ll go back to the things you were doing for pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Well, again, you know, it’s amazing how inconsequential events remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I ha- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or - or a cub scout, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but also a staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d- you couldn’t go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy it, but next <span class="DLF">door</span> , or two doors down from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a -- a <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square pole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Well, it happened then again that another two <span class="DLF">doors</span> down was, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , a -- a -- a man who used to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , and he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the -- the -- the legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me wait, and was sit down, and he put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lathe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And then he began to explain to me while he’s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a square, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give it shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a craftsman in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a compliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in mathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">If you solve a proposition in mathematics, you know when you’ve solved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">You don’t need somebody to come and say yes, that’s right, you know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Unlike physics, or -- or science where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical observation, experiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Which 1s then half wasted because it requires both intellect and observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires also some training, which obviously involves the brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So I -- from those early things then, I wanted to build things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And so when we went to <span class="REGION">California</span> for the first time, I bought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I remember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent of the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the amount of marble, and just reveals what’s already there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  What about -- well --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  All right, so -- so -- so -- wha -- you asked me what I like to do for pleasure, and part of it was, when I was at Bell Laboratories for example, then I belonged to a Bridge playing club, and 1 -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> to have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the recreation room, and -- and play <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bridge</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bell Laboratories</span> for example, then I belonged to a Bridge playing club, and 1 -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the cafeteria to have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">recreation room</span> , and -- and play Bridge until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in Bridge as well as in chess, you have to have good tutors, especially wish have -- to have very good partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing in tournaments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, 1s -- it was -- it’s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">This is a -- a- a game with the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It’s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there are two boards, with a <span class="DLF">wall</span> in between the two players. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So both boards are set independently, and each player does not see what the other’s board contains. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And the moves start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role 1s only to say whether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Permissible in the sense if there’s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let’s say, a square ahead, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And his other role is to say whether you have captured a piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">That’s the only thing he’s permitted to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don’t know the deployment of the opponent forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Now, as you proceed with the game, and pieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out, you begin to have a pretty good idea what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So these are the things which are intellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">But inc -- we moved to <span class="REGION">California</span> , I bought a saw, and I started make -- making things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Making things out of wood, then when we came here I made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> which I showed you upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I made some other pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But now I don’t do these things any more, now it -- it’s -- a new toy has come into my life, and that’s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">The other passion is music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I’m a -- a musician monqué as they say in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">If I had another life, this 1s what I would have liked to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  And tell me more about the kind of music that you feel you most enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  Well, I have always thought that my eldest sa -- daughter Sarah really was born about three or 400 years too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Her li -- preferences, and the things that she likes in [indecipherable] are more suited to the Renaissance days of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , at least as I picture them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Similarly, my tastes in music are really frozen, as it were, between the 17" and the beginning of the 20" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">So I only listen to classical music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And although I studied the violin, it is a terrible instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">It’s a punishing instrument because it’s very, very hard, even for experienced violinists to -- to make a good sound come out of that instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And although I never took piano lessons, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> attracts me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Occasionally -- I have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">keyboard</span> , if I hear a melody, or a part of an opera and I want to reconstruct it, and I -- I can go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">keyboard</span> and try to -- to -- to play.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">QUESTION:  Course you can do wonderful things with musical composition on the computer now, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">ANSWER:  Yes, but -- right, but I think -- and I’m sure that some of that can be very creative, but I don’t have the training to -- to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So at times I try to play with programs that- in the computer that do that, but I co -- quickly see that -- that -- that -- that this is purely mechanical.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I know that you’ll be going to <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> some time later this year, has tru --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [indecipherable |</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- has travel been an important part of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1198">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I have not travel -- after my retirement in ’91 -- in 90, sorry, even -- I did not agonize very much about what I was going to do, I know many people who are approaching that age, or -- or time, they say oh, what am I going to do afterwards? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Well, I thought for a little while, but then I said all right, P'Il try to do whatever interests me, and -- and if I begin to climb <span class="DLF">walls</span> in the -- Pl -- P'Il think of [indecipherable] then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult for another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had started, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So I did that for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the European community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work which was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with telecommunications, and it’s future in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I mean the telecommunication system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">So for four years, I traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">I was practically on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> every other month, through Europe, throughout Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I -- ’'m no -- I’m talking about the east, but primarily the western part of Europe, and <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , doing this consulting work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Then a year after that, a big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the Irish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> a number of times, which I -- both Paulette and I love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I have lots of relatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">So there’s a -- a lot of progeny that’s -- that’s now in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Plus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one of about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> via <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , and then go from <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , through <span class="COUNTRY">Syria</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> , eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Now some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that’s for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">What 1s not known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and -- and essentially kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Some of them were captured by the Germans, by some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Some were also denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">But one of them made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">But 1500 made it to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">QUESTION:  Now, do you f -- do you follow -- d -- do you have any comments on what’s happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now, and do you -- I -- I -- I’m -- I wondered to what extent you’re more politically aware than many a -- sort of homegrown Americans may be, not just regarding <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but be interested to know your thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">ANSWER:  All right, well, first of all, I -- I -- I think I’m -- I -- I read avidly about current affairs, both in the press, and -- and in -- in magazines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I think about that, I talk to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">What -- what has troubled me about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I could not really understand even a woman as -- as bright, and as capable as the former prime minister, what -- her -- what was her name?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">ANSWER:  Golda Maier, who at one point was asked about the Palestinians and says, ““Who are they?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And I really have not been able to understand the -- the mentality of some people, both in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I think sometimes more of it among some of the leadership of the Jewish community in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to -- to almost ignore the existence of -- of a group of people, namely the Palestinians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">M-My own preference would have been the kind of a thing that as we know from events, things came almost close to being done, except at -- at the last moment, at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">altar</span> <span class="DLF">altar</span> , one or the other di-didn’t -- didn’t -- didn’t make it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I think personally both -- I think that’s historical invisibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">The end of it if it -- it will take place, it -- 1t would be along the lines of what Rabin and -- was attempting to do, or -- or Barak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">But I -- I -- I -- I talk to my relatives, and I- | find them on both sides of the issue, and I -- I hesitate -- although I do not hesitate to criticize the government, or -- or individuals in -- in the -- in the Israeli government, because sometimes I feel that they lack statesmanship, and -- and savvy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">But then I also realize that -- that since -- there’s a Greek saying that if -- 1f you are not in the -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dancing floor</span> , don’t attempt to teach those what -- what are the -- the right steps, and because I’m not there, I -- I -- I -- I can voice certain observations and certain views, but not t-to the point of -- of -- of being adamant about it, because I don’t live there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  -- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Well, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Sometimes they are from the sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">For instance, okay, today 15,000 arrived and were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And then this individual was punished with 10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of entries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Well, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16 August of ’44, where he says, “1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Then he says how -- so many males, so many females. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Not of the total, but so many females were given numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the following numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And I knew from Sam’s number on his arm fits exactly in the range that he’s -- he cited there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I asked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, “Very early, dawn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And that makes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day, because they didn’t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So that was the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">What drove me then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> , in mon -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> , very few ever reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And now not that much had been written, so I was beginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Now I know the Germans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mobile gas vans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It was before the <span class="BUILDING">killing factories</span> began to operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Well, then I found in a book that the Bulgarians who occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this book which is called, “A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> ,” makes the following assertion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">That in the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- 0 -- a -- an item unique to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">But emphatically Pve concluded there is nothing unique about the Holocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And so I contacted Yad Vashem, eventually I got the microfilm, it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But then, while I’m waiting for that, I thought I would to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Yes, we have 1400 photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Well, here is two huge books, but you couldn’t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">But together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same number as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and address of these persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to my relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Now though, since it’s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at the end is f. There’s Colonomos from my mother’s brother, I found my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">My uncle Salamone Hamma, my father’s brother, and my father’s sister, Oro, who had married a man named Franco. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I was a bit moved by this discovery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following Monday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, “Well, Mr. Nehama, you know, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,” -- I said, “Look, let me tell you why I’m calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps maybe I can help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">She said, “That’s what we were going to ask you too, if you would be willing to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And that’s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> carrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a reader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would then transfer them to the computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Then one day it dawned on me that instead of trudging and getting all these things to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , maybe I would rent a microfilm reader, and bring it here to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I don’t have to -- to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But immediately then I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, 1t gives you a copy out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printer</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">microfilm reader</span> , and if you press it, 1t gives you a copy out of the printer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally so that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printer</span> can print it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">If it goes out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printer</span> , it can sure go to a CD. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">So I took the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on one -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Then after that was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the Yad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you magnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that different clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing over time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And it -- it was a-another almost eight or nine months of very eye breaking e-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">But it was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But it was also very rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  Very rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1291">QUESTION:  What -- what are the other things that you want to do in the remaining time you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I mean not -- are there other interests that you have not yet pursued?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  Well, let me give you an example, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">A few years ago, the -- after my first grandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like everyone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So -- so I put together a little handmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity -- special relativity, not general relativity to a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they don’t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Suppose it was on -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- say speed of light was 30 miles per hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">What would happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">You -- you go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and -- and you see a person in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it’s one of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that’s one of the aspects of -- of special relativity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">But because you can’t make -- you know, but -- so you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I’m waiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the relativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell them, or tell them other stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Because I remember from childhood I would be fascinated I had certain heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Or -- or Hercules, or Eracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was Alexander the Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug in many respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">That’s the kind of thing that I would like to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1309">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">So it sounds to me as if you -- there may be a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> for those ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  Right, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  I was thinking, I think Einstein said he asked the questions only a child would ask, and that ties in with something you said earlier about working in <span class="DLF">fields</span> where you are free of the sort of strictures sometimes placed by --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">QUESTION:  -- certain <span class="BUILDING">workplaces</span> , and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">Well, you see, Einstein said that imagination is much, much more important than even very sharp intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1316">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">You know, often 1n these interviews -- and -- and this is why I think of this question, about your sort of resilience, and your psychic state, but ha -- have you felt that you ever needed to have psychiatric counseling? </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I -- I’m -- y-you know, I wondered if the -- I know your brother Sam would have seen and experienced far more horrifying things, but I wonder if you felt some degree of trauma from the losses in your family, and that -- that -- that has at times been difficult to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">ANSWER:  Look, I -- I have felt, or I have thought about the Holocaust and what happened to my mother, brothers, the other relatives, and I am absolutely certain that he has colored part of my outlook to life, to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">But can I make a connection, can I - was there -- was there a time when I had personal difficulties? </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I mentioned to you the divorce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">But I -- I didn’t find that -- that a, even if there was a connection, that I would be able to -- to -- to get relief, to -- tying it to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So it’s one of the unanswered things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I have been m-more impressed by the works of all of the writers of the Holocaust, there’ve been quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">But the one that -- that I admire most is Primo Levi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Number one may be because he was both a -- a scientist and a chemist, as well as a extremely sensitive individual, let alone a -- a wonderful writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And you know, although most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying because of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne -- essential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal problem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it would not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">QUESTION:  Right, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">ANSWER:  I think -- when we were talking, and you were asking me about the recent work that I had done, which I call the trassiteration and translation project with the archives of the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , it was -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</p>
<p>ANSWER:  You don’t --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Oh, let me ch -- let me see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">ANSWER:  You need -- you need a [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">This is tape number four, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We were talking about one aspect -- not that one aspect, but I think you used the word, and I almost at the same time, that the work that I was doing was very rewarding, and I-I -- I think it’s very rewarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">There’s a matter of me corresponding with -- his name 1s Moses Hasson, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santiago</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , because the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> were early settlers in 1916 in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temooko</span> , in the lake district in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lake district</span> in Chile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in <span class="REGION">San Francisco area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And it was through Mark’s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran¢aise in- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , and we have a facsimile of his letter from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yale</span> , where’s he’s addressing the illion israllitany versell in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during the first World War, to almost the total destruction of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Then -- then my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span> , thanking the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for a shipment of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">All of that, in addition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">They don’t think about anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Then they go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they meet other people, so they begin to share. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">When they have a family, they begin to give to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">But some people stop there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Still fewer give to even larger circle, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which they belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don’t know whether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history that he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">So ’m glad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a ledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">So that’s the kind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I’ve done represents, and then finally that I may be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it’s -- it’s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me insistently to do, to write my memoirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">So at least I -- 1f -- 1f I only write certain other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> , and I don’t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can refer to, 1f they choose to, after I’m gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So --</p>
