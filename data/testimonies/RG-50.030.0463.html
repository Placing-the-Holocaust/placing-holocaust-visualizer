ANSWER:  Ba -- there were basically four -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was a textile center. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We called the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was called before the war, the Polish Manchester. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And the tanneries were really a minor industry, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There were four of them, all three Jewish owned -- no, all four Jewish owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Three of them specialized in what they call upper leather, supp leather, one specialized in sole leather only.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Oh, ah, ah, ah, sole.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  My father’s tannery was the supp leather, upper leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Although he was a master tanner and he could produce any type of leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Did you work in that -- in the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  No, I did -- no, I wa -- I was b -- I was born in the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We lived --
QUESTION:  Really in the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Ah -- oh yea -- well, 1t was a compound that was in -- it was a -- that consisted of the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">housing complex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">The <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> -- the hou -- <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> was occupied by partners and family only. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I was actually born in the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> , on the same <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And the <span class="DLF">tannery</span> was a -- my <span class="DLF">playground</span> , considering that we lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> there was no such thing as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> just gradually tapered out. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And it -- a leather tannery being a smelly and pretty dirty business, was by necessity located somewhere where -- pretty far out, away from the center.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  How does one get the -- the leather? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The -- the skins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  I'd say it’s a very complex process. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">You start the -- actually, leather 1s a -- they’re two separate words. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We start out with the hide, and when we say hide, we mean a skin of an animal beginning from the time when it’s removed from the carcass up til the tissues are saturated with some chemical that will stop it from deteriorating or rotting. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">That means -- we call it a hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That part of process -- and 1 -- it’s a -- it’s a length -- it takes even today with modern methods, it takes anywhere from four to six weeks to process a hide into a finished product. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the reason I say today because in 1946 - ’47, I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">leather tannery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And the process was virtually identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Matter of fact, the machine I worked, I -- I was assigned to, the particular machine, was identical with the machine that we had back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was virtually no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The same machine, same thing, same way, same method. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, ou call a hide all the way up to the tanning process. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The minute it’s tanned, that means the tissues are permeated with some chemical, from then on it’s leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And all consecutive stages of it, we talk in terms of leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The tannery was my <span class="DLF">playground</span> because there were only the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> resided in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And as you went out to the peripheries, there were less and less Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The peripheries were populated by blue collar Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Especially that the native Poles were a minority in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> had close to a million population, something like 800,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 native Germans, which was termed in German the Volksdeutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So the Poles were really a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They were hi -- and there were <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , when we talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where -- <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> where the only Gentile was the janitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The entire <span class="BUILDING">apartment house complex</span> was part -- occupied by Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">For instance, the friend of mine with whom I’m staying right now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> he lived on <span class="BUILDING">Piotkowska 20</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And it was a gigantic <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , two <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> , house at least six, 800 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the only Pole was the janitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  And was this typical of the way in which the groups lived, that there was mostly separation between the groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  So you had no Gentile friends, or [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Well, well, in my case, there were on the -- to the best of my memory, I lived on a dead end -- you know, it would help us, you have that map, it’Il be a great help if we could kind of --

<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  So this is where the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> was [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Right, this is the -- this was the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> , and this is the <span class="DLF">ghetto boundary</span> , the future <span class="DLF">ghetto boundary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The Jews really occupied densely, the <span class="REGION">area</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Balloot mart</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">market</span> -- going this way, which would be -- this map is very wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">This is north, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Right, right, so going north.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Going north. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was the s -- [indecipherable] 1s <span class="DLF">Freedom Square</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And that -- the densely populate -- the poorer Jews lived between Belt mark -- <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and that’s [indecipherable] more or less here. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That -- that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balotte</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balote</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">This is the old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the new part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was centered more or less around <span class="BUILDING">Pietma Center Piotkowska</span> with all -- the sizes are not shown, this densely [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  And this was all Jewish populated. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So you see us who come out here, that was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">This little <span class="DLF">street</span> -- we -- I live on a dead end <span class="DLF">street</span> , and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">factory compound</span> was actually closing the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And how do you pronounce that? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Quid --
ANSWER:  Kwizinska.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Kwizinska.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  While the Poles were very hard Polanizing, actually the original name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was feesh -- the Germans named it during the 1917 occupation, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fishagossa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then the Poles called it Walitsa Fishaira. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Apparently Fisher must have been the man that started the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But the Polanizing pressure came on, and everything got Polanized, so they done away with Fisher, and they -- up til ’39, a lot of people, Jews especially, still called it Fishagossa, not Kwizinska.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  And why is there a number one to five here?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Well, what happened was the tannery was -- my father was a person with no formal education. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He only attended a chaider, traditional chaider. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">However, he was self educated 1n his - in his teens, he -- he was born into a very religious Orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My grandfather was a Hassid, a follower of the Alexander [indecipherable] which makes him a real Hassid, he made annual pilgrimages to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> of the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I don’t know whether you’re familiar with these things, are you?</span></p>

QUESTION:  No, no, you s -- just explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  And so my grandparents had -- my paternal grandparents had about eight, nine children. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I believe five boys and -- six boys and two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And the boys were of the pretty independent mind, and my grandfather was a very strict person. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Especially that -- back then -- we talk now about the late 1800, beginning 1900, children were considered a labor asset. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So as soon as the kids reached an age of let’s say eight or so, my grandfather put them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they worked for him til they reached the age of reason, which would be something like 12 or 14, and at the age of 14, they simply disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My father himself was the second born, and he run away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the age of 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Pretty far, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He run away all the way 300 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And he stayed away til he was 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">At the age of 19 he was -- at the age of 14 he was self supporting. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He had the trade that he learned between the age of nine and 14 from my grandfather, in my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He was so good that he was hired as a expert, or experienced worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he didn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> til he was 19 where he could stand up to my grandfather.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Tell me, did your father’s sisters run away too, or was it [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No, th-they stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then I think when my father was about 18 or 19, he embraced the Tolstoyan philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He became a follower of Leo Tolstoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">As you know, Leo Tolstoy was not also a auth -- not also -- not only an author, but he also formed a specific way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I think there’s still a foundation somewhere <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> that was run by his sister -- fa -- by his daughter, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I wa -- I passed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binghamton</span> and I saw si -- a sign on the outskirts of bir -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binghamton</span> , something about Tolstoy and there is the foundation still there functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And that’s why my father, for example, ne -- was not a smoker. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My father did not smoke, that was part of that Tolstoyan way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">No whiskey [indecipherable] just didn’t drink, either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He was not a glutton. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">That’s again the Tolstoyan principle, don’t overeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Eventually he -- while he embraced it in his formative years, therefore it -- some of it, some principles of it stayed with him for the remainder of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It also involved some intangibles like honesty, like forthrightness. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It’s a -- it’s a way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Tolstoy formulated a complete way of life, to lead a clean life, both ways, physically and philosophically. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Eventually my father became a member of the bund, that was the Jewish Socialist Worker’s movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And he was capable, while my father’s ancestors, that’s my grandfather, I imagine even people before my grandfather, were all leather tanners because in the medieval times, tanning was one of the few trades -- [phone ringing] -- Is this going on?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Anyway, going back to medieval times as we just should do, the medieval girls did not accept Jews, and there were very few trades available permitted to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The Jews were limited to money changing, trade, some thing -- whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But not skilled craftsmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">One of the few exceptions in crafts and trades was leather tanning. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was dirty, was filthy, the way it was done in medieval times, and it required a great amount of skill. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And apparently the medieval Gentile had no inclination either to get himself all dirtied up with filthy rotting rawhides, nor put his mind to the comp -- to the complexities of tanning, converting a raw hide into a finished product. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So that was one of the trades open to Jews, and my grandfather was a medieval leather tanner. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">However, he did not make a go out of it in his adult -- young adulthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And he had to support his family by other means. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My grandm other descended -- dese -- is a descendant of the first settlers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">My grandmother’s name -- maiden name was Lieverman, however there was, because there were so few Jews in [indecipherable] intermarriages in families were common, and her stepfather’s name was Hanoch Lodzki -- Lodzki. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Lodzki means, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Therefore, if we go back to let’s say 1820, when Jews only had the -- the given names, and they had to be identified by some kind of a surname or a handle, this was Hanoch from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Lodzk1 1s an adjective.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  And always a -- with a slash on top which makes it a U. Lodzki. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Just like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jakuv</span> could be spelled two ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I can spell Jakuv with a U, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I did not spell Jakuv with a U. In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we spelled Jakuv with an O with a vertical slash above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Poles use the U two different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So his name was L6odzki which definitely puts his ancestry way back into the first settlers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And he was quite -- and her family was quite prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Apparently my grandfather’s family was not prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skierniewice</span> , somewhere within I would say 20 - 30 mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It’s a hamlet. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And the marriage must have been a brokered marriage, as all the marriages back then were. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">A usually young man went for the dowry. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I mean, let’s call a spade a spade. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So apparently my grandmother’s family was capable of offering a sizable dowry, and to satisfy the [indecipherable] family of my grandfather and the marriage took place with the condition that my grandfather will move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skierniewice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> where her family will kind of see to it that they will be able to become economically viable. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And they opened for him, or purchased for him, a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> somewhere -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staramiasta</span> , somewhere in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barlutai</span> was farther down, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staramiasta</span> was coming up. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">My grandfather was not successful as a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  -- because it just -- either he didn’t produce good enough leather commercially, he must have been behind his times in the product. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So he came back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and started a <span class="BUILDING">upholstery shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And that’s where his boys were trained in upholstery business. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And that’s was my father’s occupation or trade at the age of 14 when he ran away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He was a experienced upholsterer. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He was hired to run a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> at the age of 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That must have gone on til the war broke out, the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I don’t know about the future wars, but in the past wars, the one I know of, which is the first and the second World War, the minute the rumor of war starts, leather becomes gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And as soon as the war started, there was a scarcity of finished leather and my grandfather went back to the original leather trade which all a sudden became very profitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I heard tales that he used to tan the hides in my grandmother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , if you can imagine the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Well, it was illegal, because all this was <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , what we would call it in modern terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Back then it was just forbidden by authorities, so was -- you would buy some hides off a peasant and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  My dad came back si -- sometime in that -- at the end of that period, that means around 1916 - 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And he joined my grand -- the -- the leather trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The demand for leather was so great and so profitable that all sudden all the sons engathered, and they all started producing leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And all of them became knowledgeable in leather tanning. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">However, my father had the greater expectations of himself and he single-handed made the leap from medieval to modern leather tanning. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He taught himself German, and he read -- studied German biochemistry books, because there are no book that relates specific to tanning. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Maybe right now there are because we live in specialized times, but back then if you want a formal education in that particular profession, you had to go into it by chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And the only biochemical -- biochemistry available was in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And J still -- in th -- our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my father continued try to improve his methods, he continued to receive from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , German textbooks in biochemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And he became -- he made that transition from medieval to modern process. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He became a master tanner, one of the best known master tanners in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  So by 1919, when the war ended, they -- my grandfather and his sons, two sons, three sons -- no, two sons -- my grandfather and two sons became wealthy enough from this semi [indecipherable] war time production of leather to acquire the property on <span class="BUILDING">Kwizinska 14</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">factory building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And installed in 1t modern leather tanning equipment imported from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  And when does your father get married, and to whom does he marry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Oh, wait a minute, that was -- that was like in 1919, and because originally -- and originally there’s -- the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> was owned -- established and owned by my grandfather and my two older uncles, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and Simon. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">However, my rel -- my father’s was [indecipherable] that’s right, excelled in the knowledge, both my grandfather and his brothers, so they hired him to become the master tanner, in charge of the production. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And you say -- asked me before what it was -- mean to be a master tanner, master tanner means the -- being a -- the chemist, knowing the chemicals, the mix, the application and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">In addition, the master tanner also has to know, and be able to instruct -- hired workers who had no skill in that trade, how to use the mechanical part of it because there were also machines that processed the product at different stages in different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Some of them shaved it, because basically a hide 1s too thick, has to be more or less brought down to a specific thickness, especially that after tanning, the tissues do tend to swell. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So if you start off with a raw hide, let’s say like a quarter inch thick, after it’s tanned, it’s three-quarters of an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well, you can not use a finished product three-quarter of a inch thick for a upper shoe, or for a pocketbook or a belt or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So this had to be -- the thickness had to be reduced by mechanical means, or shaved on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">power machine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And then there was a machine that would soften the leather because at some stage of the process they were coming out as hard as a board, and they have to be like, flexible. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And that was done by a machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And then the final glaze was not a paint, but was applied again by heat, by a steel roller striking the face -- the grain of the leather that was prepared before with some type of preparation and that will produce a glaze. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So it was a mechanical process, therefore, a master tanner had not only be -- had to be not only knowledgeable in the chemical -- in the chemistry of it, but also in the mechanical in order to instruct or pass judgment on the performance of the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So that’s a nutshell, is a master tanner. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The man in charge of the entire production, knowledgeable in each <span class="NPIP">phase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And by 19 -- I believe ’21, my father earned enough -- saved enough money. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">My father married, I believe in 1919, something like that, because my sister was born in 1921. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And -- and around 1921 - 1922, my father brought himself into the partnership. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And moved into the <span class="BUILDING">factory complex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Up til then, while he was employed, he did not live on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The <span class="REGION">premises</span> there -- the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> was restricted to owners only. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">As long as he was not an owner, not a -- a matter of fact, he lived right on the corner, in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the corner of the <span class="DLF">middle street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">That will be 107 Demillaskaga. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">That’s where my sister was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">That’s the way I’m kind of trying to get the chronological data because I know my sister was born on <span class="BUILDING">Demillaskaga 107</span> in a high -- rented apartment, while I was born three years later already on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kwizinska</span> on the premises of the compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And by then my father became a partner to the [indecipherable] to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And there just very few Jewish families, and I remember them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There was at 111 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yumanoskaga</span> , which 1s just a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> down, there was some kind of <span class="BUILDING">textile product plant</span> , again with <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , owned by a family named Friedlander. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They were very wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Must have been a very successful plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Then going ho -- there was -- but there were no boys my age, there was a girl my sister’s age, a daughter, and my sister was friendly with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then going farther toward the outskirts, at about 137 - 140 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yumanoskaga</span> was another textile processing recycling plant, owned by a Jew named Osher. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The reason I’m naming these names 1s because by the -- by the oddest quirk of fate, I came across these people many, many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I came across the name of Osher, Heinrich Osher in the chronicles of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> , that the -- put it in context, that there was a Heinrich Osher who married a Gentile woman, and lived outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and that Pruschidsky puts together some kind of a story about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I knew the man because the head of the family, Mr. Osher was a widower and he had two sons of the first marriage, Heinrich was the youngest son of the first marriage, and they had two children, a son and a daughter after the second marriage, and the son and daughter of the second marriage were my age -- the son was my age, and the daughter was my sister’s age. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So that was another Jewish family when my sister already had two friends, girl friends, Jewish girl friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I had at least one playmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I would say up to the age of three or four, I played with Gentile kids because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kwizinska</span> was an odd <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There were only six residential properties on the left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The right side was a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> with a wild <span class="DLF">garden</span> behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So you’ re talking about S1x properties, maybe 30 - 40 Gentile families, and us, the Jewish family, closing off the <span class="DLF">dead end street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I played with the Gentile kids my age til I was about three or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But once they reached the age of three or four, five, they already became permeated with the anti-Semitism at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and they -- I became ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They wouldn’t play with me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And from then on I was leading a pretty solitary life. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I had no playmates except when I would venture out to see that fellow Osher, his name was -- his name was Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Solomon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  Yeah, we call him Sollik. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He’s alive and kicking in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> [indecipherable] I heard about. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And out of necessity -- now my -- now we talking [indecipherable] we talk about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">My mother, in contrast to my father was a well educated person. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">My mother did not -- family did not originate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They were immigrants from <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And they came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ukra</span> -- <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">My mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The Russian and Ukrainian Jews were much -- were not Hassidic, and were much more for enlightment education. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Therefore my mother attended a <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> , which is equivalent to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and graduated from a <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">lyceum</span> , that’s the two additional years preparative for <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">My mother was fluent in Russian, both in speech and writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">My mother spoke accentless Polish, and wrote perfect, correct Polish, while my father never managed Polish at all and spoke broken Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">My father’s native language was Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He would navigate in Polish, but it definitely was not the grammatical Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Did your mother speak Yiddish as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  My mother no -- well, in addition to flawless Polish, perfect Russian, good German, not so much in language as in reading and writing, she spoke Yiddish in two dialects. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">With my father’s family she spoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">With her family she spoke Litvok, Russian Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So my mother, out of -- I guess out of desperation having this kid four year or so old with no playmates, and I must have been pretty bright for my age, she taught me how to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I was reading fluently at the age of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And I spend my ti -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ’s first grade -- there was no <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , first grade started at the age of seven, not six. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So between five and seven, I spend my time between reading whatever was available, and using the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , as my <span class="DLF">playground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And early on I dif -- developed an affinity to hang out in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And I must have a inclination, inborn inclination to work in mechanical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Early on I achieved dexterity in mechanical capabilit -- whatever mechanical. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Because of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , and the -- the -- we employed about 20 some employees, it wa -- wasn’t a great big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And everybody knew me because they -- th -- the workers, that was not much of a -- what would you say, leaving and hiring, the workers are permanent. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">A matter of fact, I had a picture here of a di - end -- entire <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> group, the crew, with three men that knew me -- Gentile Poles that knew me since day I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And that picture was taken in 1946, so you can imagine there were -- once you got a job in a -- 1n that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , in -- especially in -- in my f -- in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , in a place of work that was supervised by my father, you were never fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You could quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">If you were fired, you were fired for -- you had to be a real bad person to be fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">My father did not believe in firing people, that’s part of his Tolstoy principle. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Matter of fact, to [indecipherable] and -- and leap ahead, about 1937 I believe, the Polish parliament passed a law outlawing ritual slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I don’t [indecipherable] but there was an anti-Semitic woman representative, in the [indecipherable] which is equivalent Polish to <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">She put the bill, presented a bill to the- saying that the ritual slaughter is inhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the bill pass, and all the Jewish butchers went out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And my father on principle, even though we didn’t need any more help at that time, hired, I think four ex-butchers, because after all, they lost their livelihood, and being butchers, they were at least familiar and [indecipherable] hide were not odious to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So he hired them. </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="377">But of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that I liked best was the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Why

class="sentence" id="381">However, the Poles -- the Polish authorities preferably had s -- did not preferably -- would not mix Jews with Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So therefore, if you run into a survivor out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who will say that he attended a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> or even a

</span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we did have in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , our own Jewish private school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Unfortunately it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And there was no way to send a seven year old one on three different <span
