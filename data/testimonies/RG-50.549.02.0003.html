<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  [had one brother who 1s still alive, who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I had no sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My family was very large and most of the family was destroyed during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The Viennese part and the part living in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the -- only two cousins and my brother survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Is your brother older or younger than you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  My brother is 85, I’m 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Was your mother a -- a homemaker, managed the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother was a homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">She was a very, very good cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">She was a very -- lady always of good spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">She was -- she did many good deeds out -- spontaneously. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She had poor people, or people who were -- who were in need, and she was a very warm person and also her whole attitude was Viennese. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">For instance, she would sing all the time, and would sing Viennese songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, in my time, only my grandfather was religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He went every day to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but he said it’s nonsense what they are saying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Yet he insisted to go there because he said one has to maintain the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Not to go there would be a kind of betrayal of our ancestors. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the rest of my family was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At the high holidays they perhaps would to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but not otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  What about your family’s politics, your father and mother’s politics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Well, you know, my father had the great experience of the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And he, like all the grownups who lived in my time were against the war, were for democracy, were against the Hapsburgs. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So now, as I read history, it turns out that the Hapsburgs were really protectors of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were not against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They used the Jews and protected them, that is to say, at least in the last two centuries, as least since Joseph the second, who contributed to the emancipation of the Jews who lived between 1780 and 1790. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He was emperor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  When Hitler came to power did your -- was your discussion in -- among your f- father and mother ab-about what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Well, it was not only when Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My parents and the whole population was politically very interested, very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I remember that as a little boy, six years old, I saw the Nazis marching with the red flag, with the swastika in their flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But these people were not considered to be our enemies, because the personal relations with them were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they were in principle against the Jews, but not in practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And the -- when Hitler won a great victory in the elections of 1830 -- of 1930, then the Nazi wer -- Nazi problem and the Hitler problem became very acute because we knew very well, we understood very well that might affect us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Were you --
ANSWER:  So let me say, we followed it very, very, very closely and although I was a young person, I didn’t have much experience, I know a lot about the initial time of the Hitler regime because it fascinated us and we knew, we realized we have a vital interest 1n it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Were you close with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We -- we were very close, even though there was an age difference of five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  You played together, and --
ANSWER:  We played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Of course, he was the -- the model, the role model whom I followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Is he still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No, but it’s in a different stage of our life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  I wanted to jump way ahead --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  -- to your meeting with Elizabeth and your f-friendship with --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  -- with her and the first time you met her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Well, we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We were refugees, and we were really at the lowest level of society because we had no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The French didn’t like u -- not -- didn’t like us, not personally, but they had too many refugees, there was unemployment in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and at this time I met Elizabeth in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , in the summer of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She went -- she participated in a club of young [indecipherable] and I once came there and participated in this club, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">A kind of club, it wasn't a real club. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And that’s where we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And that was before the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">That was in May 1939 and the war broke out at the beginning of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  And did you become friends then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Oh, we became friends from the very beginning, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  What was it that was the attraction between the two of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Well, that’s very difficult to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You know, many great philosophers have th -- have thought about the reasons which attract men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I think it’s very difficult to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But it was also a tragic time. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We met in May 1939 for the first time, the war broke out at the beginning of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I volunteered for the army, SO we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I came back on leave in December 1939 and then again in -- at Easter time, I think in -- in May -- March or April 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And then the war separated us completely, but we met after the war by chance, in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and were for a short while together, but a couple of months later, I was interned 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was after the defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and so we -- we -- we didn’t lose contact, because we were 1n correspondence, but in December 1941, Elizabeth and her family left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So I didn’t see her from ninet -- from 1940 until 1947 where we met again in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then we married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  You also were -- you knew her mother and father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I knew her family very well, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with her father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Very friendly relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Her father was a very, very highly educated and highly intelligent person, so it was very nice and interesting to talk to him and s -- her mother was a very nice lady and a very friendly lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And at one point in the video you said you couldn’t stay with them, you had -- you went off --
ANSWER:  I couldn’t stay with them because when I was reunited with Elizabeth and with her parents, her parents -- her father was not yet demobilized and they had no money and nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I remember the whole family, that is to say, Elizabeth’s father, Elizabeth’s mother, Elizabeth and for a couple of days even I ate the ration which her father got from the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So one meal for four or five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That made it impossible to stay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Well now I want to jump ahead further, past --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  -- the war, to liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I wanted to ask you what happened -- if you could recount what happened immediately following liberation, where you went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, my libern -- liberation is a very long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I de-decided in -- to evade and not to go along with the SS on their hung -- on their death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was in hiding and then the Russian army came and I went back -- I tried to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but there was still war, you couldn’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So I very los -- sI- slowly drifted back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and from there to my former <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where there was nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I stayed another year in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and that was the beginning of communism, but it was not the communists 1n power, but you felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So in 1946 I got a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where I stayed another year and then I left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and came into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in February 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  When -- when -- immediately after you were liberated, what did you have in your possession?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">As a matter of fact, four months -- no, no, that’s not correct, two months after my liberation, I got the first document which established my identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Before -- and I still have it, I had proofs that I was deloused, see, because 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish towns</span> they tried to prevent the spread of lice, all of us had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So they gave you a paper that you have been 1n a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they disinfected you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  How was your health, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  My -- I recovered very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I had the very good physically constitution, in spite of the fact that I was fo -- over four years 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and I was over four years or even longer hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And in spite of the fact that wa -- I collapsed twice due to hunger, I recovered very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Very, very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I -- my liberation took place in January 1945, and in May, June, I looked absolutely normal and I felt very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Do you remember your first full meal after liberation, what that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes, there I got a little bit sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We crossed the <span class="DLF">Czech frontier</span> in February 1945 coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we were received by chance, by a Jewish family which had been hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And they had -- they came back to their own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there was plenty of food and great comfort and they were extremely friendly to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And sure, the first meals made me sick, but that was temporary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  You ate too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I don’t know, but 1t made me sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Had you been thinking when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> what it was you would want to do when you -- if and when you were freed, or you got your freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No, that was impossible, I mean, our main concern was not to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And so what we would do afterwards was beyond us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  So when you were li -- when you got your freedom, what were your plans, what were you thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  I had no plans, and most of those who survived had no plans, because the impact of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was overwhelming and it was very difficult to find your orientation under these new circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had no plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And if I had a plan it was later on my wish to be reunited with Elizabeth and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So if there was any element of a plan, it was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Did you know the whereabouts of -- of your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I know it very, very wer -- in great detail, for the following reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">When I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brno</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , there was a man who had been with one foot in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He had converted from Judaism and was Catholic, he had a non-Jewish wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So he was always supposed to be deported but was not deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was a neighbor of ours and a nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And he called me and told me the following, that during the war a German soldier came to visit him and brought a message from my father which stated that my f -- my mother had been -- had been massacred together with 30,000 Jewish women -- women and my father and the husbands and the relatives had to look on. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And this German soldier was behind where my father and his colleagues were. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They were -- they formed a kind of outer chain, then there came my father and the men, then came the SS and then came my mother and all the women, who perhaps had to -- probably wi -- had to dig their own <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So that was one -- and as proof of the veracity of this story, my father gave to this man, who was a very decent man, who happened to be in the army, a picture of mine, a photo of when I was about 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">A couple of days later I met a young man in [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">His name was Spitzer, I still remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And th -- after he heard my name, he told me that he had been with my father in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , and he knew my father very well and he confirmed the story, my father had told him the story which I heard from this former neighbor of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I said goodbye to this young man by the name of Spitzer and two days later it occurred to me, I have to see him again and talk more with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I couldn’t find him any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  And when you were liberated, you -- you knew that your father had -- had been killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  When -- you know, I was liberated under very dramatic circumstances, the SS evacuated some 5,000 of those who were with -- had been with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz number three</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And there were, however, other prisoners who had come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and many of them were massacred by the SS after the people who were originally with -- with -- with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> had been -- had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and were on this -- on these death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was -- th- the SS set fire on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it was very miraculous that I escaped and survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And it wa -- it was from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which happened to be between the German and the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> -- we were in between -- that I escaped into the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  And had you heard news about your father?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  When I left there I was with somebody and we walked, we decided to walk to another -- to hike -- I [indecipherable] to say walk -- to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And we wanted to hike, but there were -- except for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian military wagons</span> , there was nobody on the ro -- on the <span class="DLF">road</span> who would take you along, who could take you along. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was very cold, snow was very high and we walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And why were you going there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Because I had the 1 -- I knew the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , he -- has -- has been liberated, so I had the foolish idea to go east, east, east, and cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">high mountains</span> in -- in winter and go to this liberated part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  And how long did it take you to get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Well, I can tell you exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the 26" of January, 1945, and we crossed the <span class="DLF">Czech frontier</span> on the 14" of February, it was rather fast, relatively fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But generally we were walking -- perhaps no -- not always. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Sometimes we got a -- a -- somebody took us along. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But somebody was always the Russian soldiers because there was no other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What -- you had mentioned, I believe, in your video that in postwar <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> there were -- arbitrary things were happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  What was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Well, the Czechs were very badly treated and very badly oppressed by the Germans, and by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And when the war ended, they decided to expel all German inhabitants of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Now that was certainly arbitrary and cruel, because not all Germans were Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And so the Germans suffered like the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Not quite like the Jews, but similar to the Jews, because this deportation of the Germans were under much better condition than the deportation of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Created not only hardship, many people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But the difference was that when the Jews were dep -- deported, they knew it’s -- 1t’s a death march, th -- it’s -- it’s the end of life, whereas the Germans didn’t have to fear that they would be bad -- that they would be killed when they got -- they were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And the Czechs were very chauvinistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Was there much anti-Semitism in postwar <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You know, the -- the czechos -- <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the Czech -- <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak Republic</span> was very democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Was founded in 1918 and [indecipherable] 1938 and there was no antisemit -- no anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">One of the few <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there was no anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It has a very humane and liberal government, there was no anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And the Czech government also behaved very tolerantly towards the refugees who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">After the war, they come -- as long as it was there the communists were very powerful, it was still a democratic regime, but they started to prevail. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And Is -- as long as I was there I didn’t -- I didn't notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">There was no anti-Semitism, but I do know that under the communist regime, shortly thereafter, when they came to power, there started to be anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And certainly it became stronger and stronger and in 1951, Czech communists who were Jewish were punished, and one or two were hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And they were selected because they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They were Czech communist Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  How long did you remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  I remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">From ’45 to ’46 and then I got the visa for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  And y -- and during that time you were studying, you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">You asked me before what my plans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I really didn’t know what I should do, but I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Not -- not very enthusiastic, not very devoted to studying, but I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But I really don’t -- didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You know, it was an entirely new situation and not only for me, for all those who came back and who were more or less in the same circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Not only were our families destroyed, everything had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So you couldn't find your beer -- bearings very easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Yes, you said you were disoriented, that --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And you know, if you read, you know, about the book, “AII Quiet on the <span class="REGION">Western Front</span> ” by a German writer, Remarque, who describes the first World War in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He wrote a second book which is called “The Way Back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And 1n this book he describes the disorientation of former soldiers, German soldiers, they don’t find their way in the German postwar society. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And in a certain sense you find the same thing with the American Vietnam veterans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  And still they don’t find their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  W-When did you begin finding your way? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">When did you begin becoming oriented?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Well, I think only in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and only after I had finished my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">When I er -- I would say when I got my first jo -- not my first job, no, no, I had many temporary jobs, but when I got my government job. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That was settling back on that- into normal circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Did you ever think that you would live a normal life after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Oh yes, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But you know, you didn’t see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Can you talk about your reunion with Elizabeth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Well, Elizabeth worked at a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> in the New York Public Library and -- and not necessarily she, but her father scratched together enough money to take a trip to Europe, and they came incidentally with the Queen Elizabeth, which was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury boat</span> , more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after these many years, and she found that we love each other as we did before and we decided to marry, and so we married. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And yesterday it was 50 years since we married. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Of course we never expected that -- is that we would marry -- we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We were bo-both born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We never expected that we would marry in the Royal Borough of Kensington, in -- which is part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Well, congratulations on your 50" anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">How did you first get word that Elizabeth was even alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I mean, I think in July nine -- th-the war ended in May 1945 and I think by July communications were possible, and I had a cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and knew -- he knew Elizabeth and he knew my address, and I had written to him and so I [indecipherable] Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  And how did you locate -- how did you locate her? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Did you write her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  So you were married 1 -- after -- a week after you were --
ANSWER:  Right, right, something -- something like this, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  And that was a surprise to you, or --
ANSWER:  No, no, no, we intended to marry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  Oh yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  You knew that you were going to -- to see her and that you would probably ask her to marry you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Then, how long before you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  I came to be married in June 1947, and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in February 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  And you had to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> for awhile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Thad, because you see, at that time American immigration was based on quotas and the quotas depended on the pla -- on the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I was not born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , I’m Viennese born, so I was in the Austrian quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And because of persecution, and the Austrian quota was always oversubscribed, it was very difficult to get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I got priority because after having married, I was the husband of an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Elizabeth was already an American.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  So what was that like, coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1948?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Oh, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was very impressive and it wasn’t very encouraging because you wondered how you can withstand all the <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> tha -- I mean, not the <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> but the way of life that you didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It took some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Takes every immigrant some time before he gets somehow settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that affects all -- all phases, all aspects of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">For instance, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , on the first or second day, I asked when we have to go to the police to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I didn’t realize and couldn’t understand that you don’t have to go to the police and register. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  -- and one of the most amazing -- amazing experiences was that I had to go -- I had to have a document notarized. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I was told -- and I asked where 1s the notary public, and I was told it’s the newspaper man at the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I couldn’t imagine that a newspaperman could be the notary public, because in Europe a notary public was a man of a certain standing, like a lawyer, with a big <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I went around the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper stand</span> , I was looking for a sign that this 1s the notary public, until I realized, or somebody made my mistake understood to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  So, you were still disoriented.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yeah -- so -- but a -- but yeah, cli -- they are little things and I think all Americans, or most Americans -- no, all Americans except the Indians hail from immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But the present generation and those who have se -- have -- who have been -- who -- who -- who are natives of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> don’t realize what it means to be an immigrant anywhere, not only in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">For instance -- after all I was a person of common sense, I didn’t know how to do certain things at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , because your -- the way the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> worked here 1s different from how it works in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Now, that’s the other way around to, if you move to Europe, or to any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  And how was your English when you first came to --
ANSWER:  Well, I could speak, but it -- 1t was broken, it was broken English and I really have ne -- never fully acquired a mastery of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  So what were your impressions of -- other than the examples that you gave, about the notary --
ANSWER:  Well, the impression were overwhelming, primal -- primarily because <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is more advanced in many respects than Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And number two, I came from war-torn Europe, which had fallen back beyond the time when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , conditions were pretty tough as compared to pre-war times, to peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And the American civilization is quite different from the European civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So there are many aspects and many details which we have to learn about, to which we have to get accustomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Elizabeth said that -- that it was the freedom that was remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Being able to just walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was remarkable, not only the freedom in comparison to what happens now, also the safety and security. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">For instance, I worked -- when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , when I studied, I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">typewriter shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And sometimes we were told by our bosses to bring a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> somewhere to some part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> , to deliver it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There was no fear whatsoever that somebody would take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">There was no fear at all at that time, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that somebody would attack you, that somebody will mug you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  So what were your plans when you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , did you have any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  I had no plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  And how did you [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I thought it’s -- it’s -- it’s reasonable to try to continue my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And that what I did during the first two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But I wasn’t sure whether my studies would help me and whether I -- whether I would succeed in getting a reasonable position, or a reasonable job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  What was -- what was it that you wanted to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  [really didn’t know what I wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  You were doing odd jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Yeah, but the odd jobs I did only because I was studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I wanted to finish my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I wasn’t very hopeful that would help me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  And were you going -- you were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> while you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I went -- from the very beginning I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about two years, then I made my Master’s -- I got my Master’s degree and then I was able, with the help of Elizabeth’s father to get a job as junior instructor at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That was miserably paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Elizabeth worked in -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , Elizabeth worked in the <span class="BUILDING">veteran’s hospital</span> and that we were -- that what we were living from. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And then I decided I cannot continue living on such a small salary, which practically was no salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I have to look for another job, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> being near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> looking for a job and I got one and I got first -- I got a very good offer in the treasury, but I needed a job immediately so I got a summer job in the Department of Agriculture, a two month’s job and s -- out of these two months became 40 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  You studied political science, or what did you study at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Economics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And when was it that you decided that that’s what you wanted to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  Oh, the moment I came -- the moment I came, I think the second or third day after my arrival, I decided I have to continue my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I had studied in Europe, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And the question what to study was clear, economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It seemed to be clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  Why was that clear to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  Because it seemed to be a practical occupation, not to remove from life, not necessarily a research [indecipherable] you can make research in economics, but it dealt with contemporary events. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And that, of course, was of great interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  When did you become an American citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  In 1950, bec -- I didn’t have to wait five years because my visa was based on my -- on Elizabeth being an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So after two years I became a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Was that significant for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Was it very meaningful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Oh, certainly it was very meaningful. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was more than meaningful, it was a major event, because you mustn’t forget, we always speak about the Holocaust and of -- and of persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But the fact that we were refugees before, meant that we were odd man out, we had no legal status. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We had no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which we could appeal for protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Nobody cared for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So to be again -- to have again a little status, and what was more, to be an American citizen was grandiose. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So that was certainly a great event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Was it in a -- in aroom or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where a lot of people were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  No, no, it was my cousin -- my second cousin who is now dead, and I don’t know who else went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Elizabeth? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don’t think Elizabeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Wa - no, 1t was just a judge and it was a ba -- the -- the -- I mean, the event alone was - the fact of the event was impr -- impressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  What -- what did it mean to you then to be an American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Well, to be the citizen of a big <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which was a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and a humane <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but I -- I -- I mean, I wouldn’t say I’m -- I never believed I am a Yankee, or I could become a Yankee. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I was a citins -- citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And don’t forget, I was born under an emperor and I was an Austrian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And then the empire collapsed, then I became a Czechoslovakian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Then I was nothing, because there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> any more and nobody else wanted to recognize our nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Then -- so when I became an American citizen, this had many aspects, many positive aspects, but from a very personal point of view, it meant that was again -- that I wa -- I was again irregularized. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">What is a man who has no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He’s a nobody in the sense of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Was there -- I-I’m sure there were negative aspects of -- of your -- your arrival to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and your -- your transition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  What -- what were some of them -- were the hardest things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  I don’t think there were any negative aspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I was not very encouraged that I would be able to succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I mean, I was interested in economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I was interested in studying and then teaching, that was very nice, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johns Hopkins</span> , so it was a modest position. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But teaching there was very nice and I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But I couldn’t see how I could return to a normal, middle class life, because during s -- up to the time I had gotten a job in the government, I was not mi -- I was not middle class, I was very far down, no, that didn’t -- that was no hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">That was one of the positive aspects of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that in spite of the fact that I had very, very, very little money, I could have a breakfast which was richer than the breakfast of a European minister of that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Unless he dealt on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , he couldn’t have a breakfast, at that time, which cons -- for less than one dollar I could buy toast with butter, a piece of bacon on it, orange juice -- imagine orange juice at that time in Europe -- compared to Europe, and -- and coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So I wasn’t suffering in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Why did you have such doubts about your ability to ex -- succeed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Because we didn’t know how -- I didn’t know how to succeed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You know it only afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">You cannot judge an experience which you don’t have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  You -- did you -- you consider yourself an ambi -- ambitious person before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Did you have a-ambitions and --
ANSWER:  No, I am not ambitious, but I am interested in many things, and I am particularly interested in history, not only for academic reasons, but I lived through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">You know, we -- we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and during my earlier life in a very, very upsetting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I mean, the collapse, for instance, of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was a major, major event. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And the collapse of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the abandonment of -- of the Czechs [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">All these were major events which affected us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So, it was difficult to find, at the beginning, a satisfactory orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Di-Did people wa -- in your first few years in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , did people ask you where you were from, what had happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Were they curious, did you talk to them about what had happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Well, you know, when you asked for -- when you applied for a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , people were not allowed to ask you where you are coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It’s -- you know, in -- in order to -- to avoid any discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But on the other hand, people had not the slightest idea of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">That’s a phenomenon that’s an - a-- a Subject which became interesting only in the 80’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Once a la -- I told the lady -- I don’t know any more who it was, but I remember the event, that I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And she said, what did you do to get into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="386">She had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I -- in- when I arrived in -- in the summer of 19 -- 1948, I had a -- an eczema. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It wasn’t dangerous, but it was all over my body and I had to be hospitalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And the people in <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai hospital</span> didn’t -- also, they saw my number here, they didn’t want to accept me because I had -- I couldn’t promise that I would pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So th -- there was a -- tha-that’s a very interesting phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Now there’s so much talk and fuss about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But people here discovered this only -- well, I would say in the 80’s, not before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  People ask about the number on your arm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t even know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean, you know, that was, for instance, one of the great contrasts between <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Europe, because in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- 1n Europe people knew about the Nazi regime, and it was not only a Jewish affair, thousands of non-Jews, 10 thousands, hundred thousands [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">When you heard what the Pope said when he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , he s -- he went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where 135 Polish intellectuals, officers, had been arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It was German policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And all of them died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  So people weren’t asking you --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  -- or inquiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Were you telling anyone, were you talking about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  No, because nobody was no -- 1n the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> nobody was interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">In the second <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the few people who were interested were afraid to hear ster -- and still are, still afraid to hear stories about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">All this talk avoids talking about what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Because the listener identifies himself or herself with the person who tells the story and is afraid and shrinks away. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I mean, people go as far as Anne Frank because she doesn’t speak of in -- of g -- of cruelties. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It’s a sad story, but it’s not a story where all the bestiality of the SS comes to the fore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  Was that frustrating to you or would you rather have, at that point not have talked about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Well, I was always willing. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I think one should talk about it, it’s a -- it’s a major event. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But I was not frustrated, I mean, you consider people as being ignorant, because -- and not understanding the time in which they are living, if they show no interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But I know why they show no interest, they do show interest, but they’re afraid of it.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Is it still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Well, you know, the years have diminished the liveliness of the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">On the other hand, due to the fact that Elizabeth worked in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , it is now nearer to me as it would have been had I not -- had Elizabeth not worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I -- what did I want to say now? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I wanted to say something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Wa -- about Elizabeth had gone over --
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I mean, my interest in the Holocaust, I know what I wanted to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">In Europe, those of us who had survived ex -- talked all the time and all the time and all the time about our experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And of course you -- you learn from each other new things, which we personally hadn’t experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But on -- on -- on- On -- on -- on -- because of this and because I was always interested in history, and I have read a lot ev -- of -- about the Holocaust before the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> started here, I’m interested in, certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  How much did Elizabeth know about what happened to you in your early years and when did -- when did you start telling her the details?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Well, she knew in general what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But, I mean, she hadn’t experienced it either, and she was in the same category as the non-survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Non- survivors in the sense of not having gone through this phase.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  She described finding something at -- at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> about --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  -- about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and -- and --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  -- and I suppose -- and she said she hadn’t known a-about it, so that you hadn’t gone into great detail about your experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  No, you cannot, because it’s very complex story. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">For instance, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="435"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a series of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> not one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , where people came to be killed immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">In the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> where we worked, many people were killed, and people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">For instance, I was lucky not to die of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I was once near the point where I thought I couldn’t continue any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So it’s a very complex subject, very complex subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first time telling Elizabeth in detail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I think that was probably still in -- in eng -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  Sorry.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I never hesitated to discuss it with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was the f -- the fear of others, of your listeners, which we -- you noticed, which discouraged you to speak about the details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  When -- when did you talk to your daughter Nicole about your experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Oh, I -- slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You cannot tell such a story to a child, still less when you’re in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the -- when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I mean, I was attaché in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> , she was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And she did -- she went five days into the amer -- an <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> , but on the sixth day we sent her to a German -- on Saturday she had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , you know, to learn German, and she hated to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she hated to learn German, she learned it much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And under such circumstances you couldn’t tell her where we are and what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But she learned it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Ivory tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It was far removed of real life. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So I looked for a job and I found a job, a temporary job, which then lasted 40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I was very happy in that job for many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">First of all, it was a rather solid position -- a comparatively solid position. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Number two, the subject was very, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was a world agriculture, world trade, trade policy, very, very interesting subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And I and all those who worked in the Department of Agriculture on this particular subject were very lucky because we learned about foreign policy, we follo -- followed foreign policy developments in <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And from a purely intellectual point of view, we had a very interesting job. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I was in the Department of Agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">First I didn’t advance, then I advanced gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And -- and I -- I was very happy there, even is -- even when I didn’t advance, I wasn’t that -- I wasn’t happy not to advance, but I was happy there, I liked the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And in 1959 I was appointed to be assistant agricultural attaché at the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I was there from °59 to ’64 and then I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">common market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And there I was agricultural attache for 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I probably could have stayed there forever, but I got an offer to lead the American agricultural delegation in a big trade negotiation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was called the Tokyo round because the decision to enter such negotiations was made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So I was then s -- seven years -- no, over seven years, six years -- less than seven years, six years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I was here for two years and then I was appointed agricultural attaché -- no, counselor. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Counselor for agricultural affairs at the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> again, and that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So my whole career was very nice and very satisfactory and very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  And when did you finally retire?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  It was fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  It was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We had one incident which is remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We ran a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Elizabeth and I, and we overheard a conversation at the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , where one person said, no, Herr doctor, that goes too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Expel yes, burning -- to burn them, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And [indecipherable] said, all of them should have been burned, there are still some survivor.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, we overheard that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Well, it was laughable, I mean, you see, Nazism is a very complex per -- very, very complex problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">It requires a lot to understand why it happened, who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">For instance, those who were the SS, those people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and killed people and tortured people, these were the lowest of the lowest. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">These were at the margin of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The others acquiesced in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Take the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Hitler was a man who had no career before he became a politician. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Goering was a -- a former officer who didn’t find his bearings after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They were all people at the margin of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But these people didn’t kill, I mean, all -- at -- at the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But those who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> the SS, the SA and those from the -- the police battalions who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and killed not only Jews, but thousands, 10 thousands of Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">These people were really the -- the scum of the earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Really, from every point of view the scum of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> and they were also, I would say, the scum of the German people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  But you -- you had said it was -- it was fun or amusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Was there a part of you that was --
ANSWER:  Well, imagine during my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and even when I was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I used to go to the so-called Green Week, which was an agricultural exhibition in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">An exhibition which had a long tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Every year by the end of January, there was this big exhibition. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And at two or three occasions, I was invited, together with other people to dinner by the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So where I was sitting? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Not next to him, but this was a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> and I was invited to dinner by the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Certainly that was amusing, it gave me a lot of satisfaction, because I-I realized, and I qui -- I thought of it, I was condemned to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I was not only condemned to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> all of us were destined to die, by the highest authorities of the German Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And now here 1s another highest authority, highest authority at least formally, of the German Reich and I was his invitee.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with a colleague a couple of years ago, and we SAW -- We -- We -- we Saw -- we passed some [indecipherable] elderly man, well dressed and very respectfully | -- I was l-looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And I said to him, look, there still are -- seem to be people whom we owe respect to, but we are their age. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We look the same as they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  I-I’m curious about the -- the fellow survivor who is your friend here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  What in particular -- you say some -- on occasions you’ ll talk about what happened in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">What [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Well, we -- we often exchange experiences, reminiscences about the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I didn’t know him in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and he is 10 - 15 years younger than I, so he was a young bo -- almost still a boy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="751">He 1s of German origin, German is his mother tongue. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So -- and he didn’t look Jewish either, so he sometimes had a certain advantage from this fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We had fun coming -- coming -- you know, there was one SS man who both of us knew and we called him Tom Mix. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Tom Mix was a character out -- from out -- out of American movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And as far as I remember, Tom Mix was always out either to cheat the Indians, or -- he was a cowboy or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And this Tom Mix the SS man was similar, he always wanted to find a- to -- to -- to surprise us when we did something which we are not supposed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  So you talk about this fellow and -- and sort of make fun of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Ye -- yeah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But of course the memories start to vanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">For instance, it becomes more and more difficult to visualize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I think, for instance, he was probably in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> near me, but it’s very difficult to visualize this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">QUESTION:  How do y -- this is a hard question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  Certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  How di -- does -- how do you think the experience of having survived the holocro -- Holocaust a-affected your out -- general outlook about life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Oh, very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  Can you talk about it, in what ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Yeah, I can say it in a -- ina few words. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Don’t give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I never gave up except when I said I almost di -- died. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">There I was so weak, I was so weak that I asked for permission to stay one day away from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And you know, that was a voluntary confession that you cannot work any more, but I didn’t care.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  Did you have that attitude of don’t give up before the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Were you a persistent person, or --
ANSWER:  Yeah, ye-yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  -- did it add to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Just made you more --
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I mean, when the Nazis occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in which I was and told us to go back, I envisaged to disregard what they were saying and to cross the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> on my own and then see whether I can cross <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I gave this -- I gave up because I -- I thought -- I deliberate and thought it’s too risky, I mean, I will not succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  Did surviving make you -- how did it affect your spirituality? </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Did it make you more spiritual, or did it have --
ANSWER:  No, it makes me more realistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I like intellectual activities, but I don’t like spiritualism. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It makes you realistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Incidentally, realism has its own spirituality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  How does it make you more realistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Well, you see what 1s possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">You see la -- how human beings behave and you see what can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I mean, the idea of my mother -- come back to my mother, my mother, a very good, nice, non-political middle class lady to be shot in a massacre? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">That seems to be incomprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Unrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Completely unrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">You can say out of this world, yet it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And so many other things happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  Does it make you question the -- the goodness of humanity sometimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  Human beings are neither good or bad, you know, some are very bad, because they are, as I say, the scum, I mean the lowest level, educationally, morally, in terms of their experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But there are other human beings wi -- who are very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Astonishingly good. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Willing to sacrifice. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">No, I think one cannot say human beings are bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">There are many bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">You know why? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Because they’re weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And that is one of the basic explanation for the behavior of the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Just think of the fact that the Germans were one of the most civilized people in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And they were a Christian people, I mean they had to learn certain moral -- moral -- moral be -- about moral behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But don’t you do what we must not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And they acquiesced in these horrible events, in this horrible policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But they were afraid and fear, fear is one of the most potent motives for human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  Do you consider yourself a hopeful or an optimistic person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  Yes, I’m optimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Which doesn’t mean that we might not anticipate horrible things to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Horrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Why, the Holocaust could repeat itself on a much larger scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Or when the Jews were killed as -- suppose six million were killed, 20 million or more, it’s perhaps 30 million Russians were killed, in one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They were not only shot, I mean, they died of starvation after the war came to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Millions of Poles have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So there could be a new Holocaust -- I don’t mean, necessarily an anti-Jewish Holocaust, though it could be an anti-Jewish Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  Do you think your -- your testimony and the testimony of other survivors makes that less of a possibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Not to the same extent as some people believe in, particularly the people who founded and who promoted the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , because the horror of these events is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent its repetition. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And moreover, concentration on the Holocaust alone doesn’t give you a sufficient explanation of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">You cannot understand the Holocaust if you only speak of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">You have to see the whole system which ruled in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and which was one of the most barbaric systems in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Imagine what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Not only did they kill people, murder people, but they took their teeth, their gold teeth or their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Now, the most backward people considered it anathema to utilize parts of human bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I mean, the -- the cannibals, that’s a different -- the cannibals are something quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The Germans, the Nazis were below cannibalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Below cannibalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So did you bring us sandwiches, Liesel? [</span><span class="sentence" id="830">tape break]
QUESTION:  So I was curious why you agreed to take part in this project and to tell your Story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  I think it is useful to take part in the project because it may contribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">It does not necessarily contribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It may contribute to make the Holocaust or the experiences connected ti -- with the Holocaust more plausible and understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">But it probably never can do full justice to the experience of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">If for instance I were to tell you, or to somebody else, that one of the most horrible experiences was not hanging and beating and killing, but to be on a very cold day when it was rais -- and raining, the rain was a bit icy, in the open, and not being pushed by the SS because they went into hiding, they wanted to protect themselves against the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And standing there from six o’clock to six o’clock in the evening, doing nothing, just standing there freezing and shivering, that was an extraordinary experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Or, how can one -- and one doesn’t do it really -- is in this interview convey what life is like if you are undernourished and hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">If you have no soap, no toothbrush for months or years. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I never had -- I never had the toothbrush in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">If you’re completely cut off in the outside world, that is to say you’re not supposed to na -- to write, you’re not expected to or -- or supposed to, or permitted to receive any correspondence from wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">It could have been, if paper taken from cement bags, which were -- was plentiful and on the <span class="DLF">construction sites</span> -- the only thing which was plentiful, serves as your handkerchief, as your toilet paper, as a means of protecting yourself against the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">This is difficult to convey, but however little you can convey, may be useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  You seem to talk about these things with now a sense of detachment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  Was it always that way, or --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We were 1n a relatively favorable position, as far as our attitude was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">When we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the greatest powers in the world, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> fought against the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So there were our allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And whate -- whatever success they had was our success, it was a step nearer to liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I always think that in this respect we were favored, 1f you compare us with the prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They had no hope that Stalin will die, or if Stalin will die, there will be another Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They had no hope, or hardly any hope that the regime would change and that they would be libera -- that they can expect liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">For us the situation was, 1n this respect, different and that was the -- th - that was the -- th-the -- the -- the idea which kept us alive and which made us hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  Do you ever think about what your life would have been like had the Holocaust not taken place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  Yes, but I did -- I do not come very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I cannot imagine it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But there was another thought which we had particularly at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">When we were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the question was, why are we deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And while we thought of ourselves as workers who will have to work, why do they dis -- deport old people and children? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">What sense does it make? </span><span class="sentence" id="861">These people cannot work. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And there, I personally envisaged that the Germans are going to establish a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave county</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or <span class="REGION">area</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , that’s there -- that that is our future. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We might be slaves forever, if we survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And then, you know, there’s another thing, we must not think of it respectively in the sense of drawing conclusion on the basis of knowledge which one acquired only after an event took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">For instance, I didn’t know, and my colleagues, we didn’t know that the Germans are bent to kill all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Really, not only all of us, that we expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We were absolutely convinced if they want, we were 5,000 in this one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they might decide tomorrow they will kill all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But that they are going, and are bent, and decided to call -- to kill all Jews, that never occurred to me, and not to the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I mean that there was the plan of mass ec-ex-extermination, that we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Because what I should have done before we had this interview was to write down certain points and deal with them, which I didn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And then --
QUESTION:  Oh, I think you did just fine without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  -- and -- and then it’s a bit incoherent, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So you -- you had the systematic questionnaire.</span></p>
