<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  So in the beginning, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Young people -- everybody has to go in the morning under the guard to do work. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I was working with my older brother.

people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and make smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So they surround, for example, one part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And this part people couldn't live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They have to go to the

id="119">So this was in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">1941, they, they asked to get -- to give to them thousand young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the people who are partners like small government in <span

to have a list of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So this was going to 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then in the beginning of 1942, they said, "Two thousand." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They have at least -- they came to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they wanted to take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But my younger brother, he was a little physical stronger, he said, "No, I will go." </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they took him to the

id="132">And they took him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He, he voluntary -- he was going because he wanted to save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I was still working with my, with my parents and, * Murderous campaigns undertaken by the Nazis for political, racial, or eugenic ends (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="135">and my brothers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We apparently didn't know about deaths, what's happened to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But my wife

class="sentence" id="149">When they took my brother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , she was going to see him, because she was a girl and she was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She could go close and see something. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He can go to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">She ask some

class="sentence" id="157">So she has to bring him some clothes, this and this; and they make arrangement where, where he has to come to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And this time she came but they make special hours when she will meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But there was now going the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military trains</span> , and all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civil trains</span> were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">First, military. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So it was a couple of hours, maybe two or three hours late she came, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> was - she couldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">In meantime, he -- according to, to his agreement with

<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  This was no -- there were a few <span class="DLF">streets</span> they surrounded with <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And there was watch, like police. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Police watch-- watching men, Polish, and there was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Was the stationary because when it was Aktion, it came special group--SS or special military group who was taking the Aktion then or doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But when this other, they left to the domestic people to take care about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That the people cannot get out, that cannot go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But my wife’s little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">She was going, playing and she was the messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She was bringing some message. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We wanted something. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We asked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">She would prepare in, in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Always I was under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> sneaking through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I was coming and I took her to pick up something. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">In the meantime, my brother, he got typhus and his friend got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That was terrible thing, but we need something to -- there was no medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Nothing but something to, to keep them strong, to fight the temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So my wife, she prepared a sugar or milk or some cheese, butter -- something. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I smuggled this back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Some drugs like painkiller drugs, you know, against high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">This was, she could get without a, a prescription. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, like aspirin, you know -- such things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So kids, they survive, thanks God. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But one time -- I have to tell this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I was going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and, and my watch was 8:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But the, the curfew was until 9:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">After 9:00, they can catch anybody on the, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They can kill without asking if you have no permission to go on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I had always dressed similar to the dress like the young Hitlerjugend,” they were wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Those high shoes, short tight black pants, and nice coat and a nice hat with a, with a -- with the, with a -- like a, no, like a shaving thing, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Like a feather, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I was going always dressed in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But this time I had an attaché case, because I was going to my way to pick up some food and my watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I changed my dress from my old dress to this dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I forget to put this -- I’Il show you this false document. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I'm going... There was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but the, the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was going from <span class="DLF">street</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which there was fixing broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So -- but on the side was <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but this was blocked by <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And was like a <span class="DLF">road</span> that you cannot go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But always I was going through the <span class="DLF">holes</span> , and I was going to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And when I was going downstairs to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> already, suddenly a flashlight went to my face. "</span><span class="sentence" id="510">Oh," I said.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="551">I'm not spying for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He said, “Don't touch me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He start to swear to me: "You such -- out. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And you, we're going to Gestapo." </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I know if he will go with me, and this is -- he said, "You know, it is 9:30." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I show him my watch, was 8:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He said, "Throw your watch under the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">This is 9:30." </span><span class="sentence" id="559">My watch was not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I was late. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">After curfew, curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So he said, "We are going to Gestapo." </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And like this, and I know if he will go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at night with this -- with me, the German, you know, police, they are going also patrols. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And they will see him holding. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They will take me from him, and they will kill me on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So I, I know the psychology of the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I start to talk him: "Hey, you are a tall guy and I am a little short man. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And you are holding me under gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">What you think, that I will kill you or I will run away? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">You're supposed to be ashamed! </span><span class="sentence" id="571">You're a coward." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And he said to me, "You don't-" T said, "You're a coward." </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So he put his gun here, the rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He walked with me like this, and we start to talk Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I talk to him Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So, really, there was going a German patrol, but they look on us and they didn't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Because he was a policeman, and I was talking to him Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He was talking to me Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They didn't understand what we were talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So they thought maybe I'm also a, a secret police. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I am going with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So one thing passed away behind me, and then we are going, there was a <span class="DLF">street</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I see from far away, like maybe two hundred yards, a small light. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And there stand a watchman as the Gestapo watchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">That's the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I said, "This is the end!" </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I talked to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He is taking me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I said, "Listen, if I am a partisan, you know, they are watching you. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Your whole family will be killed, and you will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They will put in fire your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You will not survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I said, "I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They will kill me, but you will -- " He said, "I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Now this is wartime, and this is my duty." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And sudden, I don't know, came to my mind something. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I hit him with my right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He was taller than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I hit him once right, and then upper cut his left. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He fell down like a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I felt I have such power because this was death -- life or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And I was so angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I was said to him, "You dirty pig! </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You will get what you deserve! </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I could kill you right now," I said, "but I will not do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I will not make my hands dirty." </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I turn around and I was going on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> "ID card (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="610">the <span class="DLF">street</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I was not running. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And then, in the last minute, I start to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I came to my wife at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I was out after 10:00, and she was, "What's happen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I told her the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And I was all night staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And next morning, I told her, "Go look on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Watch what's happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="619">She went. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">She came, said, "Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">No nothing, and nobody." </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">You know, quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And in the evening, I was going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And when I was jumping through the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , I heard shooting -- [Imitating shooting sound]. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And I went myself, and then I saw, look what's happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">There are another like SS man or maybe not SS man, but he was a secret police. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">There was lying a woman he took from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">A woman, he was taking off her shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">She was still alive, and he was taking off her shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He killed her because he felt she was a Jewish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">They found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Anyway, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I came to there, and I was there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Then her sister always was with her and counting, and I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I talked to my wife was yet to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, because in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> we cannot stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I said, "I have to come with my brother, with his fiancée, and my friend and his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Would be about five to seven people." </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And so we organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">She's under -- "The beginning," she said, "1t will be very hard." </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So I said, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We have to do this." </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So she was looking, and she find on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> is like a side <span class="DLF">street</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The name of Tatarska (ph) Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And this was like a nice small <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I came with her once there before she made the arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I said, "This is perfect for this purpose." </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So she make the whole thing legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">She says she make -- she get the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And when she moved there, I came there with my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And first we were looking around; and I think, "We have to make a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So under her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , I cut a piece of <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We start to <span class="DLF">digging hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We were digging, and she was taking in the evening in a sack this ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And there was some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and between them she was putting the, the, you know, the soil, so nobody would see the soil. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And we make such in that two could stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was too open. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And there was like a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> from the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">There was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> between <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So I was thinking, "Later." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But for first thing, I said, "Instead of sit in the open <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , maybe we will be there." </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But then came the father of, the father of the girl, and, and came another, my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So was a little more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I...I don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I said, "Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So we are, we are sitting in the open <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And then I told to my wife, "Look, maybe we will find an old <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood.” </span><span class="sentence" id="668">This would be nothing new. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And I said, "We will make a false <span class="DLF">wall</span> , do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">She was running around many <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and then she find somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And they brought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So they left this. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And she brought this little by little <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The neighbors was asking, "What?" </span><span class="sentence" id="676">She said, "No, for I like to cut this and cut for wintertime." </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So was not for -- not I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Then when she brought the -- we measured everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We cut it by little and we make numbers that everything will fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Then we have to nail this. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There will be noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So I advised my wife make washing, laundry -- everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you will put them 1n <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , you will hang them and they will dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The, the, you know, the washed laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So that. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the ropes, we know they, they were fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Then we put a little also <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and if you put everything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like 1s dirt and, and from the spiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">The -- took from our <span class="NPIP">place</span> they put another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Was look exactly like old thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And this the, the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was shut in maybe like two <span class="DLF">yards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I make sure of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I make, make the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was going on an angle, so I make a small <span class="DLF">door</span> , so that I can every time open, watch and close right away if somebody will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I was this what I have my curved spine. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if somebody not come. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And it's hard to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was very fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And then the people that come, little by little, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto--</span> then my brother and his wife, they came, the last ones.
