ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  To talk about your experiences, to talk about the way that the Holocaust impacted your life, and as we do with all of our interviews, we'll start at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We'd like to know a little bit more about you, your background, your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">So let's start off with the simplest of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Where were you born, when were you born and who were your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born on February 28, 1924 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and in a second floor walk-up apartment on <span class="DLF">Potsdamer Strasse</span> , which is near the center or close to the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Both my parents were medical doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My father was practicing and my mother was a psychiatrist and we lived in that same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , until we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , except for, I think, one week after the Kristallnacht where we heard some rumors that the Gestapo was coming and looking for people, so we moved to my grandmother's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> , in a different <span class="REGION">area</span> which just temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Just temporarily, and then you came back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Well, I'm not -- not quite sure because I left in 1938 on the kindertransport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  We'll get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yes, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  We'll get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Let's still stay in the 1920s, the early 1920s. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">You said that both of your parents were physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes, my father--

<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, actually he was a orthopedic surgeon, but for--for--to make a living he--he was a GP because it was more difficult to get working in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , even at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  And that would have been because of what reasons? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">A: I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I'm not sure, but I know that he had a sign outside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that said praktischer Arzt, which means GP, and that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">You know, I was, all after, very little so I didn't--I did not know about all the various complications that come in to being.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I was the only child, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother's health wasn't that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">After I was born she had pleurisy and some other -- and she was not able, I think, to have another child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  What would you say would be your earliest memory? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">A: My earliest memory, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had fairly large <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , was a peculiar long shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">You had to go through the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> to go into the rest of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and my earliest I had my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> was in my <span class="INT_SPACE">parents bedroom</span> but the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was very large. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">There was not only the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> , since they didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> , and a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> was on the other side of that so it was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but I was standing up 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and looking at the rest of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Ha-ha. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Q: Yeah, ha-ha. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Did you have -- after your mother had you, and you say she -- she was a bit sickly, did she still practice?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Too many.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Too many, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But at age, I think, five they hired a French governess for me so she was free to do things without having to supervise me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We also had a live-in maid that cleaned -- my mother liked to cook, but not to clean up, so.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Was he an extrovert?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Not -- not, you know, the bravado kind, but he was pleasant to be with, you know, respected others and.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  And your mom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  She was shyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">She was shy in many ways and a little more quiet perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Who were you closer to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  My dad.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well, here's the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My dad, in his spare time, used to do all kinds of small repairs and he actually made a lot of toys for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric train</span> set when I was a little older and he built a whole <span class="BUILDING">station</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage lifts</span> and all kinds of --

QUESTION:  Oh cool, that's so nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The set actually all together was so large that I could only use it on weekends because it went from one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to the next, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Oh God what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> set delight, to have it through the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  You know, because it's not that a kid gets a gift it's--
ANSWER:  Actually the way the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was arranged you came in from the <span class="DLF">front stairs</span> into what was the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> for the patients and the front three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , one was my <span class="BUILDING">father's office</span> , the one next to it was the <span class="INT_SPACE">examination room</span> which was not too large, and next to that was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> /<span class="INT_SPACE">sitting room</span> , whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And when we had guests there were two curtains drawn between my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and the other <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> so you didn't see all those medical instruments and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You just walked through from one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to the other, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">sitting room</span> had a baby grand, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> which was unusual for--
QUESTION:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  -- that kind of set up, but during -- unless we had guests we don't -- or I was practicing the piano ha-ha, we didn't use that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Well, I'll confess to you when I was little my parents also gave me piano lessons and I was the world's worst student. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My teacher was a composer who was a refugee and he was reduced to giving piano lessons to kids who didn't practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Ha-ha. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">No, I actually practiced and I liked it, ha-ha, but I probably -- I wasn't, you know, wunderkind talent, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I had to do my scales and things and -- but after age 12 there was just not, not time and opportunity to do that.</span></p>
