ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Just by a -- having you say your name and identifying yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes, m-my name is Jan Nowak Jezioranski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The Nowak is the nom de guerre, and my real family name is Jezioranski.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Id like to begin with you telling me where you were, and what was happening in your life at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, I was the first survivor of the Warsaw uprising who was sent as an emissary by the Polish commander in chief of the underground army, and of the Warsaw uprising to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , with microfilms, with the archives of the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And the first one who reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , on 22™ of January, ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And of course, I did work for some time with the Polish authorities, debriefing them, and also British and American authorities, lecturing, writing, until I was hired by the Polish section of the BBC, in ’48. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And that was the beginning of my radio career. [</span><span class="sentence" id="8">sneezes] Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I was trained in my profession as a broadcaster by the BBC, and I stayed with the corporation until the end of °51. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And th-then I was appointed the first director of the Polish service of Radio Free Europe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I had to organize the entire operation, all day operation, from the scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was the first Pole who was hired, and my job was to recruit people to organize the operation, to create, you know, the schedule, the programming, and all that, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So I started a sort of a second chapter of my life with Radio Free Europe, and this was probably, from the perspective of my life, the most important job I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Much more important than during the war, because during the war I was an emissary, and I was very active in the Polish underground movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But as an emissary I was rather a witness, an eyewitness of the game between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and I saw the moon from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , from the perspective of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But I cannot say that I did really influence any -- any decisions or events. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">While in the radio, we learned really that we have much greater influence that could have been expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I feel, and this is what the audience say, including such people as [indecipherable] opposition leaders, that we did have a considerable impact on the development in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> between ’52 and ’89 when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was liberated, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So this was my most important period of -- of la -- of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  I want to talk about that, I -- I'd like to go back to the -- the -- just at the end of -- at the end of the war, w-where you were --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  -- a-and -- and -- and what you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I understand you were arrested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  I was -- I was only once arrested by Swiss authorities, when my wife and I illegally crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was very lucky; I was never arrested by Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">If I would be arrested Gestapo, I would probably not be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But I was very lucky, and never -- 2September 18, 1996 never really fall into the hands of -- of Gestapo, but when we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , we were immediately caught by the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> guards, and arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  This was the end of ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was just, you know, the -- the end of ’44, and the very beginning of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And under pressure from British, we were released by Swiss, and allowed to cross into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which was already liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military plane</span> , we are -- we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  So when the war ended, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And can you tell me what -- what was going through --
ANSWER:  Well, a-as I told you already, I was -- my job was really, to tell British and Polish about the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The history about the Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">This was the time before Yalta, and before the formation of the puppet su -- Polish government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So we -- we were at that time deeply involved in -- in a very desperate struggle to really prevent what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">In other words, to s -- to rescue the independence of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And that took me my first -- first years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I mainly was focusing -- focusing on what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was a kind of a advisor to the Polish exiled government, which still existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  And where were you living for the brief period after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , how long did you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Until 50 -- until the end of ’51. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">In other words, I spent six years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  And how would you say your life changed after the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well, unfortunately, I was in exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">All my plan, my -- really, my -- my objective, I did want to be -- to be a scholar, an economist, and I was just on the point of finishing my doctorate thesis when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">That was all lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I had no chance, and no wish even, to return to my scholarly career. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Frankly, you know, the objective was how to regain freedom for my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And that was the main objective and there were only two -- two ways of -- of doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">One was to try to influence public opinion in the west, a-and the governments in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And that was very difficult at that time, because immediately after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Still some kind -- the hopes existed that -- that wartime friendly relationship with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> could continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And second was, to try to influence and educate people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And the -- the only way of doing it was by radio, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> there was a monopoly of media in the Communist hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And the only way people could learn truth, and learn about even their own situation was by listening to foreign radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So it suited me very well to join BBC because I had a chance to broadcast to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , although the contribution was negligible because the British really did not allow so-called exiles to make any [indecipherable] contribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Most of the programs were written by British, and our job was simply to translate it into Polish, and to deliver it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">3September 18, 1996
QUESTION:  I could interrupt you for one second, I’m going to readjust this. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So for those six years you were working for the BBC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and --
ANSWER:  You know who I was working for s -- no, I -- for the BBC I wor -- I worked fr-from- since °48 until the end of ’51, for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  What about the years from °45, the end of w -- the war [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I already told you that I worked for the Polish government in exile, I mean, this is the answer, I mean --
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Did -- when was the first time you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  After 45 years, the first time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in a -- a -- at the invitation of Lech Walesa on the 10" anniversary of the Solidarity, or Solidarnose. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And that was at the time when the first non-Communist government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was being formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So it was- I was there, yeah, I went to [indecipherable] to see for myself, on 20 -- on 30 of August, ’89, after 45 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what that was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Well, 1-1t was a very moving experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">For 45 years as the director of Radio Free Europe, I was on the top of the blacklist as the enemy of Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And of course, I could not go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I never -- I was convinced that one day <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> will be free again, because I sensed that the Soviet system has so many inherent contradictions, that sooner or later these contradictions will bring down the -- the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But I never hope that it may happen in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And it came unexpectedly really, and without bloodshed. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And the people were -- felt that Radio Free Europe did make a considerable contribution to this bloodless liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And so I went privately on the [indecipherable] of, I believe it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TWA plane</span> , or a -- or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pan American plane</span> , and didn’t expect any welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I -- I thought some members of my family will be there, bu- but I didn’t know that Radio Free Europe did broadcast the news of -- that I will be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the time of arrival, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, after 45 years, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> -- I touched again the Polish soil, I was very moved, I saw the <span class="BUILDING">terminal</span> with the -- this [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I saw many people, crowds of people on the <span class="DLF">terrace</span> and around the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I ask myself, why, how’s it? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I mean, it’s Tuesday, a weekday, why they should be there? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And they -- when we were going towards the <span class="DLF">exit</span> , two Americans were behind me and they said, there must be a VIP on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , because a group of people are waiting in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">That was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the entire leadership of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solidarity</span> was in the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , I had fantastic welcome, and -- by this hundreds of people who came to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And the next -- I -- the next day, the hostess, my hostess, offered that she will take me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And I said no, because after all, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and I would like to be -- to see my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I said, you will have a -- it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> -- you will have a problem to find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> , because they don’t stop, you have to find the taxi stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I said, okay, I will manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I went to the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and here was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So I raised my h -- my hand and su -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I jumped in and the taxi driver said I know who you are, because you were on television, on the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Okay, he took me to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> which I requested, 4September 18, 1996 and the fare was [indecipherable] it was 27 cents, because of the dollar was very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I decided, no, I will give him a dollar at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I gave him a dollar and he said, keep this dollar for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I said, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">How much? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He said nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Why nothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because I was listening to Radio Free Europe for so many years, free, wh -- I -- I want to give you -- offer you one free drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And that was to me very moving, you know, this one dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work [indecipherable]

<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Because I felt that I still was not old enough to retire, that my personal friend, Dr. Jezinski was the director of National Security Council, and I did decide that I could serve my old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> by being here and by trying to influence American policy towards- towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and my part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This was an ideal <span class="NPIP">place</span> , close to the administration, to the Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And with -- as I say, with few influential friends.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You had said that your time at Radio Free Europe was the most important time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  It was definitely, by far the most important. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Frankly, you know, I never thought that the -- the words, as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> carrying ideas and information may have such a tremendous impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">A-And first of all, frankly we eliminated effectiveness of censorship, because it was enough to tune to us to learn everything that the censorship was trying to keep from preventing to know, to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So we destroyed the monopoly of media, ne -- monopoly of information and education. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">As long as this monopoly existed and people were isolated from the outside world, and flow of information, th-they could have been brainwashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But once they had access to free sources of information, they wou -- they remained independent in their own mind and in drawing their own conclusions. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The -- that was our role. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Also, we did play a role of opposition and I discovered that the ruling group fights the opposition by doing what the opposition wants them to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In other words, the [indecipherable] when it is widely known, government reacts to the opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They don’t want people to believe in what they say. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And therefore they try to prove that you were wrong by acting exactly like you want them to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We -- our first rally, probably it was the most important event in the history of political broadcasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">After Stalin’s death, and after Beria was -- was killed, a very high official of the Polish political police, who had -- knew all the secrets -- all the state secrets and party secrets, defected to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And after being debriefed by the CIA, we could use him and he was broadcasting all the secrets of the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And th- there were -- the -- the entire <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And political -- they had to find scapegoats because he was revealing all kind of crimes committed by the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">In order to defend themselves, they put all the blame on the political police and they -- it was reorganized completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And the resulting chaos really -- I mean, decreased the terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">You know, people were no longer afraid because the entire apparatus of the repressions was paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And it was bef -- because of the effect of [indecipherable] that opposition in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> could became much more articulate. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They could speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They could, in a sense, organize themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And that was our major contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I -- I was curious ha -- how you at Radio Free Europe dealt with the issue of anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Well, you see, right after the war, I believe that anti-Semitism was pretty dormant, but the regime, which was under great attack from the west, for violating democratic institutions, for forging the election, in a way that they want to -- to compromise the Polish people, and there are strong suspicions that so-called [indecipherable] was instigated by the political police in order to, you know, compromise the Polish people, but in fact, th-the sad part of the story is that this kind of provocation is that there was a provocation, did find a fertile ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There was people who did the -- the d -- the fact, historical fact is that 42 innocent Jews who survived the -- the Holocaust and lost many, 9September 18, 1996 many of their relatives and friends, were murdered by the Poles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and this is something that I myself, as a Pole, I am very am -- ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I believe that we should and we did -- <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did apologize for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Then, you know, there was a anti- Semitism made in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Stalin -- Stalin was anti-Semi -- was anti-Semitic, and shortly before his death, he ran so-called doctor’s plot, accusing his doctors of Jewish background of plotting against his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that was a signal for kind of anti-Semitism that was instigated by Russians in order to divert the attention of people from their poverty, from the inefficiency of the Communist regime, and to find a kind of a scapegoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Jews were to be a scapegoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And this was the kind of anti-Semitism spread by the Stalinist faction, called [indecipherable], in the Communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And they were opposed by intellectuals, liberal intellectuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And among the intellectual [indecipherable] there were many Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And this is when we first really started to fight against anti-Semitism, ’54 - °55, after Stalin’s sudden death, when this was the means to compromise, liberally minded Jews who were in opposition to the party line, to the party system of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And there were some very outstanding intellectuals, who were opposing this kind of anti-Semitic trend, and we did a lot to support them to compromise the anti-Semitism as a -- something that is imported from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Seeing as the people at that time hated Russians, this was probably the most effective way of fighting anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We did -- dedicated lot of time and work to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  You had a lot of programming that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  I think you had said in -- in the other interview that the -- your time in the underground was the most fascinating time of your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  It was fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Well, in the underground I had adventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">There wer -- this was a time a -- war time adventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And the -- in Radio Free Europe, it was much less romantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were simply broadcasting, writing program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  What is your attitude now toward -- toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, I hate hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">In other words, I am strongly against the idea of eternal enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The Germans inflicted terrible, you know, blows to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They not only murdered the -- most of the Jewish population, but the -- but about two million Poles were killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They were executed, or deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And the- the years of German occupation were years o -- of terrible human tragedies. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So frankly, you know, of course I had very strong feelings against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But after the war, when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I discovered that you cannot generalize, that there are also some Germans who are decent, and who would like to frankly, compensate in some way f-for what they did to the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I --I -- well, this is probably a postman. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Yeah, I -- I can do -- do it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And ma -- the only problem I had with the Germans is their territorial claims against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which were extremely dangerous to our existence because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was moved westward. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We lost one-third of our <span class="REGION">territory</span> and our people were annexed by -- by the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And we were compensated by the big powers in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">A considerable part of former <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was incorporated into post-war 10September 18, 1996 <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We couldn’t possibly lost it again, it would be then a sort of a remnant state. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And so this was the main problem between the Poles and the Germans, but in 1990, Germans recognized the <span class="DLF">border</span> as final. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was ratified by the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And as of that date, 1t was a turning point. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And once the Germans reconciled themselves with the <span class="DLF">post- war borders</span> , they are no longer a threat and there is a tremendous improvement in the Polish - German relationship, which I’m very happy about, because I -- I believe that hatred is a boomerang. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">If you hate other people, they will hate you. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And so the reconciliation between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which is very real, 1s probably the best achievement of -- of this Solidarity government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  When you see that kind of hatred in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> --
ANSWER:  Oh, terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  -- wh-what -- what does it --
ANSWER:  Well, you know, this is -- you know, the hatred brings about unspeakable human sufferings, loss of life, tortures, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Senseless. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Senseless. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So ethnic hatred, and any kind of ethnic or racial prejudices are extremely dangerous to humanity, and to everybody, including to Poles also. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So Iam very happy that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , after it go rid of its- the Communist and Soviet domination is working towards reconciliation with all its neighbors, with Germans, with Lithuanians, with Ukrainians, Czechs and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And restored all the minority ethnic rights to -- to the -- its -- its ethnic minorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  In -- in the video interview you did, you talked about how angry you were, that it was a crime that the world didn’t do more to stop the Holocaust, that it didn’t listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You know, this was my very tragic experience, because frankly, I was again an eyewitness. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Of course the Jews were isolated, they were behind the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But we could -- I could still see the starving Jews who would escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and die on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> from -- from starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So it was s -- it was a tragedy, human tragedy without any precedent. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We did lose two million ethnic Poles, but only Jews were really condemned to death simply because they were born Jews, and had no chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I was the -- the first envoy who brought this information about the Holocaust, with my colleague, Jan Karski. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And then I will -- I followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> at the time of the uprising in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , and I knew about it, and I wrote a memorandum to the Polish government that they should exert their influence on the British that some kind of retaliatory measures should be threatened to stop the extermination of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I know that the memorandum was passed to Churchill, but he was not prepared to any -- to any -- the only thing he -- I believe that my memorandum did contribute to the decision to prosecute after the war wa -- German Nazi war criminals, because soon after the decision was made to install the tri-tribunal, and announcements was made that Nazi criminals will be brought to justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Then I came back, it was July ’44, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> no longer existed, but there were many Jews in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And I got instructions to pre -- to b -- to prepare myself for my second mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And to be briefed, to learn about the whole thing, so that I could again bring about some message, about what’s -- what happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So there 11September 18, 1996 was a man by the name of Volitski, who has his, you know, plaque in Yad Vashem, he- he was -- who was the kind of a liaison with the Jewish militant organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I spent hours with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He told me all about the -- the uprising and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He was himself in touch with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I got on microfilms the report of the survivor of the Jewish ghetto uprising, and also photographs, documents, which I brought in my secret [indecipherable] as microfilms. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I was the one who brought this report of the Jewish militant organization to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in December ’50 -- ’43, and th-this report was passed by the Polish government to the British government, to the organization and I was -- I did see many members of the British cabinet, members of the Parliament, intelligence -- people from intelligence community, and I was telling about what happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And, frankly, you know, as far as the British cabinet, there was no response.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  And when I talked to Eden, Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, he told me, Mr. Nowak, the best way and the only way we can help Jews is by winning the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">If we divert our limited war, you know, military resources to such objectives as bombing the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , it will delay the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And you know, when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with my wife, when I was writing my memoirs, and we went to Her Majesty’s records office, archives, I found piles of documents concerning my mission, including the reports from Eden to Churchill about our conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Not one word about the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Not one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I took to all of them, I raised the question of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I -- I strongly believe that retaliatory measures would have offered at least a moral help. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That they would know they are not ignored, that the -- the world 1s -- sees that trad -- trade -- tradegy -- tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So I feel that -- but even Jews would not believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I mean, I wa -- there was a Polish Jew by the name of Schwarzbat, who was in the Polish, you know, sort of a -- a <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> in exile, and he put me 1n contact with the American Jewish organization, Joint and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I spent hours with them, they didn’t believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">When I said that two million -- at least two million Jews were already killed, they thought that this is unacceptable exaggeration, and that I must have some political motives --

<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  -- to see that changes occurred.</span></p>
