<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Will you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Hetty d'Ancona Deleeuwe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , Ist of May in 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My family was an everyday family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I would say lower middle class and we were just an average <span class="BUILDING">household</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> part, southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and later on we moved to a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> that's more towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and uh my father had a business, and we had the business in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we lived upstairs on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and downstairs, the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , was our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we had a very comfortable life, at least I remember that everything went always fine and uh for my parents, I was an only child and my parents were very kind and we went to grandparents, to uncles, aunts - I had some cousins and we just had a very comfortable life. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I think that my parents knew that something was brewing in the background but <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> being neutral uh was not prepared to fight the Germans, so even though many people most likely thought something might happen, it was a big shock when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I was only ten at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I had just had my tenth birthday, and I don't remember that I knew how critical it all was, but I remember that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I remember that they bombed part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , the oil co...the containers where they kept the oil at the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , and it was terrible fires there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I remember that they prepared the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from where we lived for wounded soldiers but before everything was really settled in our mind that this was war, the war was over and the Germans had taken over <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And uh nothing serious happened in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It went oh I would say like the average life, it went on and then when we uh....
QUESTION:  Tell me, tell me what, tell me what an average life was? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What did you do during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, I went I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">In the summer we used to go out sometimes for months and uh my father stayed and came only for the weekends, and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> not being so large we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We went to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And my mother usually rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a pension or somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we stayed there, sometimes with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Sometimes family came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Usually for a month, and that went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I mean there was nothing that pointed to the fact that we couldn't do that anymore but I don't know exactly when it happened, they started to register people. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And but me being very little and being not always informed of all the hardships that were going on, I really didn't know much about it, especially because I was only ten or eleven and uh I didn't have to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was only for people who were older and at that time we got like ration cards and we got like a personal sort of passport but me being small, didn't own one, and uh so everything sort of went along and then at a certain point there were Dutch collaborators, NSBâ€™ they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And they had fights with Jews in the Jewish part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That's the old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that most likely was provoked. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I think that was just a set-up and that was the beginning of the final solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  What happened to you during this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  I just went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but when I was in fifth grade with, I was about eleven and a half I think, we were told that we couldn't go to the regular <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> anymore, even though there were lots of Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and especially in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where I lived and lived lots of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , so we were pushed to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in uh sort of very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , and the standards of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were so much lower than the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I was used to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I was sort of in a <span class="BUILDING">preparatory school</span> for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and uh wasn't a uh no no special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but you know, there were grades and and levels and so that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> really was not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was, not that I was the brightest but I uh was just a middle, average student, but that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was just only so boring for me, so my parents decided that I was going to go to a better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I ended up going to the south part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> where there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where they accepted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Also only for Jewish children of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Cause I was a pariah I couldn't go to a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Jewish teachers, Jewish teachers were one of the first steps the Germans took to kick them out of the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and so we got our own Jewish teachers back and uh I had to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> then, very far because I wasn't allowed on the public transportation and we were not allowed to have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> being Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The non-Jews could have their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , although it was very hard to obtain one and to keep the tires and things like that because everything sort of vanished. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was very little food, and everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The clothes was rationed, shoes, name it - everything was rationed but the Jews uh were outcasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We had to deliver our copper. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We had to bring in our radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">In '42 somebody who my father knew walked in and said, Mr. d'Ancona, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And my father had to leave his own business and the Germans took over our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Not long after that they dismantled the whole thing and there were like maybe eight or ten <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> that they used for cutting and they dismantled it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> they used for cutting, my father had sort of made himself, so my father helped them dismantle it knowing that they never were able to put it together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And all that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Everything went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and uh so that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And my father went to an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> that provided jobs and things, not because my father needed the money that desperately at that time, but being without a job was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Everybody who didn't have a job was for sure picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And my father became a teacher for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">First, out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and later he was a teacher in <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In the meantime, more people were picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">First that started with the provocative work from the NSB that they you know they had like fights in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then they picked up the Jewish man and then in retaliation they started â€˜National Socialistische Beweging. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Nazi movement in The <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">picking up very young men, sixteen, eighteen years old, and those were the first who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , I think, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and nobody ever heard from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They might have sent a card that they were fine, that they were working, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My parents kept all the information they had from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I knew it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We all had a bag at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with clothes and I think some food but uh we, I really didn't know exactly what was going on and I still wonder till today if anybody really knew what was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I don't think that anybody realized how bad it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Of course it was when when they kept on picking up people and they pushed people to certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They were kicked out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they had to move, and they picked them up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My uncle had to go to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my mother's brother, and we never heard from him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I don't know who really knew what was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> , but I never knew that they were really killing the people there like they did, and uh it was every time uh as the the years went by, as the months went by, it was tighter and tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And there were people who had like exemptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Exemptions because they quote "bought their freedom with diamonds." </span><span class="sentence" id="69">People who were wealthy or for the Germans needed industrial diamonds and there were people who did certain jobs so they had a certain exemption, and we had an exemption because we were Sephardic and my father worked on that with lawyers and we had to go for pictures and uh they could prove the Germans thought that being Marranos we uh were really not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we went digging in our roots for hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And after the war we found out that if we had had one or two more relatives who we would have known for sure were not Jewish, we would have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We would have been declared, gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But at that time we didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And at some point in time then all my relatives were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My grandparents were picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">All my friends were picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">All my uncles and aunts were gone, and we were really the only ones left, practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He decided that it was time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Now before that I had finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you know, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There were hardly any children left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That was in '42, in the summer of '42, so I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a mid...a <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> you can say where I did some work, school work. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Most of the time we were busy sending packages to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for everyday some of the children were picked up and when we found out, we sent packages to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to help them with whatever they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was sort of a crazy thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">There was not much schooling going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Teachers left. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Teachers never showed up the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know, it was a big chaotic mess, so we, I had private lessons at the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That's how late we left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I had a private tutor with a few more children and who taught us from math to languages to geography, history, name it, uh but that ended, of course when, I left in October of '43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Tell us about that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh what you had told me before, your father was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sort of on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , really on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> uh had an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> and the Germans put <span class="DLF">fences</span> sort of around it and when you entered it, it said Juden fer tal, only for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Couldn't go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There was <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> that only for Jews and gentiles couldn't go to that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so we were really outcasts and separated from the rest of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And we lived just outside of that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , so we were a little easier uh to reach, and from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> uh we could get company, non-Jewish company. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was a little dangerous for them because they really shouldn't be seen in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> , but it was not as impossible because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> it was dangerous for a person who didn't wear a star uh to show his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, since we lived where we lived, my father was involved with uh now regular daily, but then it was the underground newspaper and we got like forty or fifty uh when they came off the press, and then they were put into envelopes and I went to the <span class="DLF">post box</span> around the corner and mailed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don't even know that at that time I knew what was in there, but I took like two or three and I mailed them in the <span class="DLF">mail box</span> and uh everybody took a few and so it was the underground news sent around. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we uh, my father did during his hiding period, he made staff cards for the English army and put it to charts all the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and all the little details of the part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where he lived so that when they came that they knew every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that they could identify every <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And we had people sometimes staying in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> overnight, when they didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and my parents weren't too scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They figured they didn't have a lot to lose I think and uh so they tried to help other people, Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We had a person staying with us for quite a while uh when they first started to transfer the Jewish teachers out of the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> because since my mother was a teacher originally, she was still involved with the union, the teachers union, and the head of the teachers union really spoke out against the Germans and tried to protect his Jewish teachers, so when he was that out-spoken, he was looked for by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They didn't condone that, so they were after him and he came and stayed with us for a long time, because I think they didn't expect him to stay with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, he survived the war, I guess, that uh sort of they forgot about it and I think he went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after a couple of months, but he stayed with us for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He was a very nice interesting old man uh not being Jewish but really loving all his Jewish teachers and his colleagues. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He really spoke up and that was at the very beginning when things started rolling and it was so well orchestrated by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was a plan that was put little by little by little into place and we were all pushed together in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There was no escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There was no escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And you had to leave your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and people thought well, you know, so we leave it and live in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They really didn't think much of it, but once they all were gathered in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , one day they had a big ring of Germans around that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , then they picked up everybody and shipped them off cause even though we had many times that people were picked up at night at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when they did like <span class="DLF">street</span> or they did like a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , they uh had this plan of eliminating the Jews out of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And uh they had like little, little occurrences of picking up here and picking up there, but there were really two big razzias in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with razzias, big uh where they picked up the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I don't know what the English word 1s for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Round-up probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Round-up, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And one was in the southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and one was in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , and ...
QUESTION:  Let's hold it for one minute please. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  You were talking about the round-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So the the people in the southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> were rounded up, and that was I think in the early part of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then later on in the center part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> which was more like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , and we were also picked up at that time and of course it was like a whole city affair, and so they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they picked us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They went <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you had to show your Ausweis, your identification cards, and Jews had a J on theirs, so everybody who was Jewish had to come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And since we had this special exemption for being Sephardic, we were put in a special part of the holding pen you can say. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">All the other people were shipped to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and from there on to wherever, but we were put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in a sort of a <span class="DLF">playground</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It's near where the old <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> are now and the uh <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and there we had to stay all day, and the head of the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I still see him in my mind, and with a whole range of (ph) ladies he had with him, and so he came and we had to present ourselves, family for family, and we had to show our papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Now I was too young to have my own papers, but my parents had papers, and so he told us we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because we had this special exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So walking after eight o'clock at night, which was the time that we Jews couldn't walk in the <span class="DLF">street</span> anymore, was was very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then to have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everybody looking at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were so scared that the Germans at the corner of the <span class="DLF">street</span> were going to pick us up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Somehow we made it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then we lived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> still for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">At that time my father's brother's daughter lived with us, so she went as my sister, because she being a little younger uh didn't have papers either. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So she lived with us at that time and she went through that day of being caught and she made it through, too, because we couldn't show that she wasn't, was not our family so that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">She however ended up going to her mother who was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They were caught and they never survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was very sad of course, because we were very close at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  You had another friend who you grew up with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  I grew up with a friend uh since birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We played together in the playpen. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We went together to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We went together to first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Then we moved and to another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Wasn't so far, and we still stayed very best friends until the day that she was caught, we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We did everything together. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We went on vacation together. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We, whatever we undertook uh we were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">People thought we really were sisters I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And she went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , sort of a more orthodox high school cause she came from an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox home</span> , and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> even though it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> it was still a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And uh she was was brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">She was beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She was very very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She was, everything she could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She was good in languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She was terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">She could play piano beautifully and one day the Germans came and the family was picked up and never heard of again. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Her father survived which tn a way is so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">When you lose everybody that was around you all your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">His wife, his daughter, his son - they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And some people at a point like that just gave up and also went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And they just volunteered to go with their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Some people did that but never saw their families anyhow because by the time they reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dutch concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , their family already was gone over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were very scarce of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We really didn't know, I think, what was hanging over our heads even though we all had packed suitcase ready to go, uh with most needed items, I still think that a lot of people thought they were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And a certain extent the younger people were put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But nobody knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I don't think anybody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">My father knew a little more what was going on because he had traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before the war, and not looking very Jewish, he walked in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and saw what they did to the Jews, and he would have liked to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We didn't, were not of any means. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My father had a good living. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I mean not fantastic but we never went hungry, but he figured it was time to leave, but we had no chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I don't know why we couldn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I don't know why we couldn't go anywhere else in the world but apparently that wasn't available. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I know we had a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We had an affidavit for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But our number wasn't up yet, so we had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The second or the third day that the war broke out, that they were fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we tried to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we tried to leave then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> or so, but there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Lots of Jews committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So I have an idea that lots of people did know that it was going to be very bad for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But me being only ten when the war broke out, I really didn't know much. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But then after we came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in May, after that big razia, and there were very few people left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , we tried very hard to find out if the Germans really thought that we were Marranos or the percentage of our Jewishness was so low that they would declare us non-Jews, and at one day my father decided that we better leave, because there were practically no Jews left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were really very late in leaving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the Germans did come a week after we had left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so whatever was left of our possessions of course they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> myself without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I just walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and a lady came to pick me up, and I had nothing with me when I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And much much later I got some of my clothes, but very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But it's impossible for people to understand how hard it is to just leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , your parents, and know that you most likely never see your parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Leave everything that was everything to you, just behind, just close the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">There's an, it's hard to explain how difficult that was, and being a parent myself now, I don't know how my parents could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It's so painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It's so painful to say goodbye to your one and only child, and don't know where she is going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My parents didn't know where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They had this connection with the man who I later found out saved two hundred and fifty Jewish children, and who perished himself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He was caught at the end of the war and he perished himself, not being a Jew, but being treated as a Jew because he helped the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And he found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me all the way at the other side of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ...uh I'll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Showed my parents the picture of a lady who's going to come the next morning to take me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I had to take all the stars off my clothes like and this stuff was very yellow, and very poor quality. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Was no quality. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">You can't even call that quality, and it ran through all your clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So you had to be very very careful that people couldn't see that a star had been on my coat and a star had been on my dress, and uh had to brush it off very carefully, so when I left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> early in the morning, I was scared to death of course that my neighbors were going to see me leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> - I don't know how I made it to the, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> because we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And there she handed me over to a young man in his very early twenties and with this young man was a young boy, maybe eleven, ten, something like that, and the two of us went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh 1t was awesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was very scary because I had no name. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I didn't know who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I didn't know who the man was that was taking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I didn't know the child that was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I was a nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And Germans are always all over, so if they had come to me and asked me who I was, I wouldn't have been able to answer the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And it uh it's a trip I think that might have taken two or three hours on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but in my mind it took like, like forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We had to change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> at a certain point, and low and behold I bumped into a lady I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She was an aunt of my father, not Jewish, who was going to visit her grandchildren who were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But when I said to this young man that was my guide, uh oh, this is my aunt, he right away pushed me in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I mean we were going first class the rest of the way uh to where we were going, because he didn't want us to meet of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So at a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I had never heard of, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And we got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was on the Dutch side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Maas</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venlow</span> , right near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And the young man told me to stand there and wait till he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And he took this young child, this boy, with him and well, maybe he was back in an hour, I don't know, but that lasted forever for here I was, all on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I didn't know where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I didn't know where I came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I was so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then he came back, maybe an hour later but to me it like, like days later, and he took me on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> that he had picked up at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he had dropped off this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And he took me like for ten minutes on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the people that hid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">There was a mother and some children, and they were very, very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But I blew it the first second, because there was a visitor and I was supposed to be a relative from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , but I didn't know the people of course, so I acted very strange and I said yes sir and no sir and yes ma'am and no ma'am and so the visitor of course understood that I wasn't just some relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But they kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I stayed with those people for nearly two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they, they risked their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They risked their whole livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They took me because they felt they had to save my life, and they were very orthodox Protestant Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And they figured God had sent me and they had no choice, and they were very brave and uh the man was a repair man at the, at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He repaired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and they were very blue-collar family, but they're very, very neat family, very fine, fine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">They took me in, no rewards. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I mean from the small income they had it was very hard to feed another mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And we had like coupon cards for rationing, but since I didn't have any papers I didn't get any of those cards either. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the underground provided us with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Once a month they came, usually, and then they brought me a card, but sometimes they didn't have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They were stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And they were, they had to risk their own life of course too, to get all this, and having to take care of all those children, which I didn't know at that time, uh they they had an enormous job, so sometimes they brought me cards, and the family that I lived with had to have some help because we had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was very little food at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the spot of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there was sort of well-provided with vegetables and fruit and most of the people did have a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Maybe because we were Protestant in a predominantly Roman Catholic part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my step-parents weren't as well liked and they didn't have anything in common with those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They were sort of strangers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so for us it was even harder than for many other people to get extra food. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We got very little from the farmers that were around us, so they needed my coupons very badly, but they didn't always come. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I stayed there of course much too long for the neighbors and the friends to be the relative from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They understood that there was something more, and in many of the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant homes</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there were Jewish children hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The, I guess the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> had something to do with that and uh we went through terrible times there. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Being at the <span class="DLF">border</span> we were nearly bombed every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">The, right over the <span class="DLF">border</span> was a big <span class="DLF">German airfield</span> , and practically every night the bomb...bombers, coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , dropped a few bombs at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We gave them nicknames but it wasn't so funny for every night we were up and we were in <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Now one of our neighbors had a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> that was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> which was supposed to be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They build that themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And so everybody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , from our little <span class="DLF">street</span> went there at night when the alarm sounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But after the war they told me that the man who owned the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> had told my neighbor that he didn't like this Jewish girl in his <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> anymore and they never told me that until after the war of course, but my step-parents were a little worried because if word was going around that I was Jewish the Germans would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">My step-father for sure would have been picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">His older son would have been picked up and the family would have been in shambles. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They would of course have picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I mean I was the Jew, but they uh they decided that it was not safe anymore to go to those people, so when there was alarm at night we stayed in our own <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Uh the man who told that to my step-parents, my war parents, uh was a marshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Say you can compare that with the Coast Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And uh was an officer and uh most of the people at the border control were of course with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They, but this man was definitely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He was a real good Dutch citizen and he sheltered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He told the man that if he didn't keep his mouth shut about me that he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about this man who had this outside shelter because he did a lot of things that apparently were not right according to the Germans, so he shut him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But my step-parents didn't like to go there anymore anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, in the end of the war we were at the part where many troops were dropped for the Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnheim</span> , when the really dirty end of the war sort of set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And uh we saw them coming over and they didn't really come in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but they came near, and from that time on the war really came as the war, the fighting part of the war came close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And the Germans were in our in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and they were, out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> you saw lots of troop movements and we heard of lots of shooting and and bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">When they came very close to us, we even had Germans live in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that was extremely scary because my step-mother was in the <span class="DLF">field</span> reaping some potatoes most like cause everything was cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We had nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We only had to drink well water and so she went to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to find potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The men couldn't show their faces anymore because they would be rounded up and shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">My little step-sister went with her mother and I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone with two men who couldn't show their faces to the Germans because my step-father, working for the Dutch railroad, was on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">In September of '44 the Dutch government in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> decided that the Dutch railroad had to go on strike 1n order to help the invading troops, and to make sure that the Germans didn't have much transportation, so my step-father was quote "sick in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> " and the son was, I think he must have hidden himself in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so when the Germans came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I was the one who had to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So they looked through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they decided that they were going to take this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they were going to come back that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So at night I had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I mean, they, my my uh family didn't feel it was safe for me to sit there and discuss the war with the Germans for one moment they could say, oh maybe this girl is Jewish and that would have been the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So they made some sort of a story up that I was very tired, not being used to working so hard, and I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I was, every night I was gone when they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They stayed for about two weeks in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">It was very very tense, but everything was tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I mean the fighting got closer and the uh and then they, they had so many things going in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were against the rules of the Germans that uh you know anyth...any moment something could happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Very close to our liberation the Germans decided that all the inhabitants had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And since we were on the Dutch side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> uh they wanted us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they evacuated everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">At that point the family that I stayed with was worried that if they were going to ask for my papers that they couldn't show anything and uh saying well it's got lost, that was just not good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So they decided that the whole family was going to go under since we felt that any moment we could be liberated, so we ended up in a bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was still intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There was some sort of a <span class="DLF">roof</span> still over the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , so and we knew in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was food, so the neighbors, the border guard family and us, we went to this bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we stayed there for about three, four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Uh that's where we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">All the other people who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were on the wrong side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They had to wait another half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">However when we came back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , now the English and the Americans didn't want us to stay in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they weren't going to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> at that point and they didn't want all those civilians around, so we were all evacuated into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was away from the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And there we stayed for couple of months, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think at that time there was some sort of a newspaper being printed already. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was like free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We uh were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We had no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We had no shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was still, everything was very scarce but there was some sort of free press of things like that going and apparently in one of those newspapers that my family got hold of, they asked about Jewish survivors, and so over the time of maybe two weeks or so they asked me questions, and I never under...never got a feel of what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You know, I was sort of innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">One day they asked me what was your mother's name and the next day they asked what was the <span class="DLF">street</span> you lived in, and so they got my family's history on paper and they supplied that to a Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">My step-parents apparently had found out that my mother was caught and they never told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But not knowing where my father was, they decided that they were going to stay with me, that I could stay with them as long as more details were going to be available. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And so I stayed with those people for all those months while we were evacuated, but they gave the details of my family to this Jewish organization and they apparently compiled a list of people who survived so we went back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was damaged and empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Everything was stolen in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Uh in, then the war was finished in May and very soon after, somehow, my father came to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">When he was liberated he saw my name, number one on the list, being a little d and a capital A, in Dutch it means that I'm on the top, that they discard the d and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and so Ancona, so I was number one on the list and when my father walked out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , he nearly fainted I guess when he found out I was still around. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So he came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> without tires, all the way from the northern, most northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to practically the most southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Fought his way through all sorts of check points and he crossed the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> that were absolutely not passable but he talked his way through, also with papers from the underground, being able to show that he had worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And he came to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So in I guess in the middle of May I went with him back to the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because we really didn't know what we were going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And then about a month later, we got a telephone call, not that there were telephones at that point, but somehow we got a telephone call through the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my father was, that my mother had appeared in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , which was absolutely a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But she's the only one who came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">No uncles, no aunts, no cousins, no grandparents, no friends from our friends, circle of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">From my family, my mother was the only one who came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And that was only due to the fact that she went late. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">She didn't go, she didn't leave <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> until the summer of '44 and she started out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , which was bad, but not as bad as the rest of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So she could hold on and she was strong and young, but she nearly didn't make it of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">She she, there were hundreds of miracles that made her survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So after the war, our family was back intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We had no, no living. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">All our belongings were gone, and what lot's of people don't realize is that the Germans took our bank accounts, they took hold of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">My father was born in just in the other century, so he was like 42 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They took away his life insurance. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They cashed in on everything that was worth something. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So
