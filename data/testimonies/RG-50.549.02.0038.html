<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can you spell that please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">K-a-b-1-l-j-o.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can you please tell us when and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born June 24th, 1929, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , which is currently <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , used to be <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Were they -- Where were they born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My parents were born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reeserko</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> is in bo -- in Bosni -- <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , as we pronounce it, and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> separately and they met there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Do you know -- Tell us what you know about your grandparents on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  My grandfather, on my mother’s side, his name was Haim Kabiljo. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , a little bit before World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He didn’t do too well wherever they lived, so somebody suggested to him that he could come and work with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He put him in a business doing -- making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">This was what he would do; when people would order, he would custom make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My grandmother didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That was not customary for women to work out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My grandfather was also a shamus, which is a sexton in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , and he lived right next door, which was provided by the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My grandparents on my father’s side lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vizoco</span> , which is the same -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My gran -- grandfather, his name was Isak, I was named for him and so were four of my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He- He didn’t do anything, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He used to have a grocery store and then he co-signed for somebody on their loan and the other person defaulted, so they took my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and then he co-signed for somebody on their loan and the other person defaulted, so they took my grandfather’s store in payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My grandmother’s name was Blanca, which was -- my older sister was named for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And again, she didn’t work out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but she would take in sewing, so they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There was a wh-whole bunch of brothers that were growing up, and she, with her sewing, supported the househo -- the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about -- I want to go back to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , an-and the set of grandparents that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">What -- How was your family, grandparents and parents, a part of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , particularly, of course, of -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  My grandfather, Haim Kabiljo, he, as I mentioned earlier, was a sexton, and his main function was, as a sexton, to keep the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in an order, make sure that it’s clean, that it was -- all the things that are needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And also, one of the big problem was that we had a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and one of the big problems was trying to get a minyan, or a quorum, for the services every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So he would go searching for people, men. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">In those days, only men counted for the quorum. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He would go around searching and asking them to come to the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I failed to mention, when he got a little older, and his children were grown up, he s-started sort of s -- a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , what they sold was yard goods, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and one of my aunts, I think she was next to the youngest of his children, she worked in that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My grandfather was well known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , as one can imagine, and my mother had just terrific memories and she always talked about him after he passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But I was about nine years old when he died, so I remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">When we would go visit our parents in our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , we would take a walk and go say hello to him, or we would meet him sometimes on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I remember every time we met him, he would reach in his little pocket, which 1s -- he had a watch in the pocket, watch with a chain, and he would pull out a coin. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">A Yugoslav coin was called a dinar. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He always had a dinar for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That was good for an ice cream or a couple of candies. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So ah -- we had tremendous memories of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Our grandmother, she was a little bit rougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She didn’t have the finesse to deal with the little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So our memories are not as good as -- about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now, my other grandmother, I remember her. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She was a very hard working woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">She was a good cook and a good baker and she made lots of sweets, which we always enjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">She would ship them to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Once a year we would get a package of all kinds of goods, jellies, marmalades, cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Even a homemade salami, occasionally, which I didn’t care too much for, because it had an onion-y smell to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But these are memories of a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Since then, I learned to love onions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Can you talk some about the role that your faith played in your family when you were growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">What was -- What were the habits of how your family observed their faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Both my mother and father had grown up in the <span class="BUILDING">religious homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which, for those who don’t know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and after the expulsion, they went to either <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , or they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> and crossed over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , or they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and moved with the Turkish occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They moved further up and of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> was Turkish outpost and that’s where they -- they must have come that route, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Although <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was settled by Jews of Italian descent, which means that the most people who live 1 -- most Jews who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , came from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> , through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and crossed over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> <span class="RIVER">Adriatic</span> , into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">As I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We observed all of the holidays, quite religiously. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on any of the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We maintained a kosher home, and we -- the education was such in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , and we -- the education was such in Yugoslavia, that the primary subject in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, because we were a very small minority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would have a free period. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the- some <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> , usually was one <span class="BUILDING">central school</span> , well all -- where all the Jewish kids would come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of religious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">That’s about what I remember, as a young child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Can you remember anything -- and perhaps share it with us, that your parents taught you, not just about religion, but the -- the place of Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Where did they fit into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Do you remember them talking about that, or what was your perception of where they fit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , they were pretty well integrated with the general community. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Most of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> were either small merchant -- and I’m emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, I don’t think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The- We had, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , we were totally integrated and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">business community</span> , you sa -- s -- have, let’s say, <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span> , there would be several of them, one might be owned by a Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The rest would be owned by the local, whatever religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Prevailing religion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they also had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but prevailing Serbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern Orthodox in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because we were the ones -- we and them, were the ones who were told we can be excused during the religious instructions in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But the classes were conducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and everybody had to say the Catholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But this was true fo -- both of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And some -- some classes, there were a few of those and few Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was not a Roman Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I -- I didn’t feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when it was time to be excused. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I accepted that gladly. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What was the reaction when you stood and you did not say the Catholic prayers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well, I think that -- I had a teacher who liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I was the best student in class. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">That was my -- I don’t know whether that was a burden I carried, but I enjoyed studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So -- And I was a very, very small kid for my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Everybody towered over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So everybody considered me like a -- I don’t know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I remember now, that I’m being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would be cuddled by every teacher over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We didn’t have any male teachers, just female teachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Anyway, so, nobody ever said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from somebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I suggested that, and she accepted it for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I guess she was reprimanded later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But this came -- There was at -- somebody who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and this one young girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So she gave me the translation of the Romanian ecumenical prayer, which I -- which is the one that I brought to my teacher, and that’s the one that was tried, for awhile, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  So a-at this point, you’re quite comfortable and assertive about who you are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Today, you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  No, at this point, 1-in your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Oh, you -- you mean like [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You’re -- You’re a young boy, but you’re very clear about saying that you were quite comfortable with the mix of people and also saying that I am Jewish and I would like my faith included here, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, that was true for a long while. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">However, the situation started changing with the political situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and there was pressure on every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> nearby, to sign up with the axis powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about politics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There was a party in the -- in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , the Croatian area, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ustashi</span> <span class="REGION">Croatian area</span> , called Ustashi and they were beginning to rise up, with assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they were agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler’s, you know, values, and preachings and that’s -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more uncomfortable for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">In fact, occasionally, we w -- we would be attacked by the local kids and I’m not talking about stealing our lunch, or anything like that, although that took place on occasions, but just for the sake of playing the role that they heard from their parents, who were sympathizers of the Fascist governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  C-Can you do -- remember one of those incidents, just so we could get a clearer picture of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was located on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and there were <span class="REGION">areas</span> , the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and Saturday morning I was always at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Saturday and others -- friends of mine my age, and I, we -- we were pretty close, so Saturday after the services, we would go for a walk, and there was areas in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that were well known for people walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But we would go further, we would go to the <span class="REGION">areas</span> that are beach fronts and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn’t crowded -- it wasn’t too crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There were people there, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was in a -- I won’t call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be shielded from the wind, and our <span class="DLF">beaches</span> were shielded. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So, we would go walk, maybe even take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">surf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And sometimes, or one time, wasn’t just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> would start throwing the rocks at us, and stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty well, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end of the stick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  H-How did you know that -- How did you interpret this, or how did you know or feel that it was because you were a -- a Jewish boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well, there was no doubt, because they accompanied their attacks with vocal attacks, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So there was no doubt why they were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They -- They made it quite clear, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit more about how things started to shift? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I guess when you were fairly young, things were pretty good and calm and -- and you felt comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But then, as you said, Hitler came on the scene and things started to shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">If you could just tell us a little bit more how that started to alter life in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Things that your parents said to you perhaps, or you overheard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or ‘36, I was only six or seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> , we -- the kids, six, seven, we were pretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen to the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You know, everybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And so we were quite aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there was an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach them some form of a trade, because they were saying, 1n case you have to leave in a hurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you can do with your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had, like photography, like working with the leather, tailoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I know my sister took up sewing and she learned pretty well how to sew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Which sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  My older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Her name was Blanca, named after my paternal grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Anyway, she -- she was very young in those days, too, but she learned how to sew and later on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war, when we would get some pictures from her, she would show us the same dress that she had changed and every year it’s look different. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That was the only dress she owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Anyway, SO We -- we Sort of saw that things were not going too well in the rest of the world, for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we were conscious, so this learning a trade was one thing --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  J-Just to clarify, this 1s the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> saying to each other, we must learn a trade and we will therefore provide these courses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It wasn’t anybody else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, more than the people in the com -- Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , the organized Jewish community would engage some tradesmen to teach the trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Like maybe on Tuesdays and Thursdays, there would be electrical trade and the carpentry and leather --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Preparation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  And maybe on Wednesday would be sewing and cooking and stuff like that, for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So this was an organized effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But then came a few other signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">For instance, some of the instructors -- my sister, her first year in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> -- first year <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> is equivalent to fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She was two years ahead, she was two years older than I was, so she was telling us how her instructor was making anti-Semitic remarks to the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And of course, kids caught on and they emulated their professors. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And also, there were a few of my, quote, friends, that they would sort of jokingly make an-anti-Semitic remarks, and -- while they’re hugging me and all that, or trying to copy from my homework, they would still make those remarks. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So there was no question this was happening as gradually as one can perceive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And in the meantime, the war started in -- well, there was the Czechoslovakian take over, what we call peace in our times, and then the war started in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that’s 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">By that time I was 10 years old and I saw what was going on in the world and so did everybody around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And we saw the signs, we would see the -- these Ustashi, they would have their meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t know how to equate this to the current situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Would be almost like Blacks living integrated with the White community, but every Tuesday night, the White community would don the white sheets and hoods, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And so, is that a sign of something? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I guess that would indicate, you know, that if -- in case of some trouble, you could not rely on your neighbors too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So, that was another sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  D-Do you remember your father or mother talking to you about this, or you assing -- asking them about it, or perhaps your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  No, my grandfather, by that time, the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , Haim Kabiljo, my maternal grandfather, he had passed away and my grandmother passed away a few months later, well, 10 months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the ones in as -- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , I wasn’t in contact with them, except, well, once or twice we visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But it wasn’t so simple to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So, anyway, my parents, they had friends in the community, Jewish friends, and they would come visit us, and in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in the our si -- our area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , language that was spoken among my parents and their friends was what we call Ladino. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">This 1s, for those who are not aware, it’s a Spanish origin, which is laced with words from every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where they travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">As -- I could give you examples how, maybe Italians take a word, English word, put a vowel ending to it and give it ail or a la article and -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">This is tape number one, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Anyway, I -- I have some Italian friends and I know they take an English word and give it an ending, a vowel ending, put an article, like you know, whatever kind of article, I mean masculine or feminine and it becomes an Italian word, and into the next generation it may still remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Well, Ladino is created that way and I can equate it like Yiddish is a German laced with Polish, Russian, whate -- other language, wherever the Jews lived in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So, Ladino was the prevalent language among my parent’s friends and we learned the language very early, so our parents couldn’t talk secrets in our presence, we knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Anyway, so they -- they talked very somberly about the world’s situation in those days and, you know, it’s contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Whatever your parents fears and th-thoughts are, you -- you catch on to it and you emulate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  We haven’t introduced your -- your two sisters, so I’d just -- get you to say their names and the order of their births.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I -- I had three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">One was older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She was born in May fif -- May 15, 1927, two years older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And then I have a sister Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She was born in January fifth, 1931 and I have a sister Esther and she was born September -- correct, October 30th, 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And my older sister, Blanca, she passed away in 1993, she had breast cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And my two other sisters, Sarah lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and Esther lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And well, s -- Sarah, right now is what they call a snowbird. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">She’s currently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , to avoid the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Can you just think back about your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when you were growing up and what kind of values your parents were teaching you, and how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Oh, okay, well, the values that my parents taught us, are the values that I like to teach my children and I hope that I have been able to instill in them, some of the values. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">One, that I keep telling my children, my father always had something for the poor people. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They never were turned away and they used to come quite often to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He taught us never to let -- let them leave without giving them something, at least - no matter how small it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I know we would walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and somebody would -- some of the what yo -- we call today, street people or homeless people, they would be sitting on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , they would stick their hand out and my father, like we would pass there, my father would stop, take out the coin, give it to us and tell us to hand it to the beggar. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But there was even more to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He would -- Well, this one thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There was a guy that was really down and out in his luck and h-- he would beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He was an immigrant to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , he was a Jewish young man and he didn’t care for begging, so my father one time suggested to him, why doesn’t he buy some nuts and salt them and toast them and make little bags and sell them? </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And he did that and I remember our father would always buy two or three bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He didn’t like the nuts, but he bought them, because this was a way of supporting somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And only recently, I was reading about the life of Mimonides, the philosopher and the Jewish theologian, of the what, tw -- 12th century? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He -- 12th, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Anyway, and he had -- he wrote on every subject conceivable and one of them was charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And he had -- he sort of set up eight levels of charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And I know the highest level is helping somebody become independent and this is what my father believed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We also believed that the children should get better education that their parents had and we -- we were sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we -- wh-when the war started, Jews were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I think I mentioned that the professors, of course, couldn’t teach, so what we did, we created a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The professors that were fired from their jobs, they were employed to teach the Jewish kids who were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Well, my father, he had a little misunderstanding with somebody, so he didn’t send us to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but he engaged tutors to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and teach us things. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, oh -- also, he was teaching us the religious subjects and we learned a lot in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When we would go to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , we were always top students and like, let’s say if I was in third grade, I would usually be placed with kids of the fifth grade or sixth grade, because of the -- my level of knowledge of the particular subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">My mother was a very, very hard working person, I guess by necessity, because my father didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , but he would just go there in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My mother would go early in the morning, open up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and she would be there all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And in those days, you opened the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> about eight o’clock in the morning, you closed it at 12, you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">You went at four, you re-opened and it was opened til eight o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">This is, I think throughout Europe, they had this. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Some people call it siesta. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">In summer, I guess, people would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , eat, and go to sleep for a couple hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What else did we learn? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We learned -- One time I found a wallet that belonged to a construction supervisor and he was ready to fire half of his staff and -- and my -- I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with it and my father told me to go back and find who it belongs to. “</span><span class="sentence" id="216">Don’t give it to anybody until you’re very sure that you find the rightful owner.” </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I remember, I had looked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , there was a lot of money in it, but the guy only gave me one dinar as a reward and I was pretty unhappy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But my father told me that the return of the wallet was a reward in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I’m a little choked up now, talking about these things because it brings memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So, maybe if you give me five minutes to get back to my own self, yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  I want to shift now, to what you remember about your parents actually making plans so that you and your father could leave at a moment’s notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You mentioned in your first interview, that you actually had little rucksacks, little backpacks packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Can you remember how that came about and the actual packing of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Well yeah, that’s really what everybody in the Jewish community had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Well, let me mention something like, when the war came, the food became pretty scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So, we were lucky that we were occupied by the Italian forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Now, what I need to mention 1s maybe we skipped quite a bit here, because the war came to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> in April, ‘41 and this -- your question pertains to our leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , which took place after the -- Mussolini fell, after the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and what they call capitulation, yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Well, one reason I think it’s -- it’s probably okay to skip some, is because of your prior interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I think that you covered that very carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  And in some detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, un-unless there’s something specific -- I remember you speaking about the Italian occupation and how lucky you were and then how it changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  So, if there’s something you would like to say, that would be fine, but I -- I think that probably it would be okay to -- to skip and try to fill in just some of that detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">No, there’s n-nothing special that I needed to or wanted to add, but I was just trying to give it perspective, and -- well, and our departure was preceded by when the Italian government fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Of course, the -- the Italian army was let go, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This mis- the general population just rushed the -- the what do you call it, we call them kasir -- kasirna, which is the military complex that was right in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> <span class="BUILDING">military complex</span> that was right in our neighborhood where the m -- the s-soldiers lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Anyway, and it wa -- they had the storage of food there and ammunition, so everybody rushed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I was watching people carrying bags of flour and wheat and you know, all kinds of canned stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">An-Anyway, so then the partisans came to the surface and it was -- before that, 1t was underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Now, there was enough partisans, they came from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , they organized the local population and there was partisan units marching through the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">If I can mention, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- I call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but it was a city of 50,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was the biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> , the coastal- coastal area and much of the interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was the, I guess the capital of the -- like we have states, they had these -- well, there was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was subdivided into -- it’s not kingdo -- the <span class="COUNTRY">kingdom</span> was the whole count -- I will have to remember this word, the translation of the word later. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And -- But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was the capital of one of these, call them states, if -- until I get a better term for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And so it was a pretty large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I mean, I remember with pride, looking at the big, tall <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , eight floors, nine floors, another one, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So, 1-it was wide <span class="DLF">avenues</span> , <span class="DLF">tree line</span> <span class="DLF">tree line avenues</span> , you know, all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was sizable and now we saw all these -- the partisans and their insignia was a red star and -- on the cap it was a -- like a military cap, you know, with a red star 1n front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And the population started participating, and they would have these meetings, town meetings and you would get maybe 5,000 people show up for the meeting and there was somebody speaking about, you know, we have to arm ourselves and we have to chase the occupation and we’re -- have to do this and that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So there was a lot of enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Just a clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  This 1s after the Italian soldiers left, but before any Germans came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  That 1s -- That is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">This was like a -- maybe what, 20 day, about three weeks in there, where the partisans were able to hold on to this quote, major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So, that was -- was like pretty wild and also like the partisans would conduct trials of the people who had collaborated and in -- there would be signs and you know, posters saying how many were convicted and shot and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was -- maybe it was <span class="BUILDING">kangaroo court</span> type, it was very swift and pretty -- I won’t say brutal, but it was swift and final for many people who had collaborated. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was a very sharp division. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">You’re either with us or you’re with them kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So the population had committed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then there was -- the German troops were trying to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but they were hel -- they were held in check at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Turks were held in check several hundred years earlier, the Ottoman empire was held, because it’s such a terrain, the rough terrain, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and <span class="DLF">cliffs</span> , that you can position yourself and you know, it was that kind of warfare that people could establishing -- establish themself and prevent even motorized units and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> from advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So, partisans were able to hold off the German troops for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And in those days, we were wondering what will happen if the partisans don’t hold the <span class="DLF">line</span> and the Germans do come. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And we didn’t know -- We didn’t think of an if, we were thinking of when, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And that’s -- in those days, we just did what everybody was aware that had to be done, namely prepare, so you can make a quick getaway by whatever means. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Some people were thinking of getting a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> that were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But that wasn’t so safe, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Croatians that were armed by the Germans, the puppet government, they had better means than the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Partisans were living off the support that they could get from general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But Germans were pretty rough if they caught somebody helping the partisans, they burned the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And later on, I remember seeing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , just everything -- no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> on it, because the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was burned, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The rest was made out of stone, or bricks, so it couldn’t burn, but 1-it was -- or, 1f maybe partisans would kill a German person, the German would just take hundred at random and shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That -- They -- They wouldn’t have to be guilty or they wouldn’t have to be partisans or anything, just hundred citizens, or hundred men, ju -- 0-out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they would take them at random, put them against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So -- Okay, so we are in this situation where everybody’s wondering -- you know, the partisans said you have to be either with us or with them, and during those 20 days, lots of people said, “We're with the partisans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So when the Germans were coming, then all of these people who had declared themselves to be with the partisans, had to find a way to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And the Jewish population, of course, would be the first victims of the German onslaught. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And Germans were bad enough, but Croatians were worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So -- Anyway, sO we were just cognizant of these [indecipherable] and we were ready -- what did it take? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I mean, it’s just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know, a sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don’t know if you know what zwieback 1s? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It’s a hard, hard -- it’s not bread, it’s like a, yeah, crust of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Anyway, so I know he had brought that. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He was in the military, the Yugoslav military two years earlier, when it was general mobilization, so he brought a couple of those zwiebacks and I remember, we tried to bite into it, impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So he put those in his, you know, backpack and of course we put -- we all, each kid had something that they made ready and after we left, my other sisters, my younger sisters, they remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Oh, my older sister, she joined the partisans immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She was 16 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Yeah, here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Was this in the 20 day period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  In the 20 day period, yeah, but we had learned -- my parents had learned that she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I remember when they found out about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That was very traumatic, you know, she -- well, this was like she begged them to understand what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Of course they were, you know, petrified from fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But anyway, so she left in the first day or two of the partisan liberation, but the other two sisters, I remember- not I remember, they keep telling us the story, how they practiced jumping from the second story <span class="DLF">window</span> , you know, on the -- on the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But we didn’t do that, we -- we had these knaps -- knapsacks or backpack or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We used to call them rucksacks, that’s, I guess, the German term. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Anyway, w-we left in the middle of the night, but we were walking out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , through the front door, we don’t have to jump out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> <span class="DLF">front door</span> , we don’t have to jump out of the window. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And as we were leaving, so were many other -- others from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You know, the ones who had committed themselves to the partisan cause, to the anti-Fascist, anti-Ustashi cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They were all leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">There was almost a major evacuation at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion your sister had with your parents, that you apparently heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">What was she trying to communicate, or what was she saying about why she was doing what she was doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Well, she explained to them that, you know, there was in-injustice in the world and that she wants to do her part. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And they were saying, you know, “Well, you’re young and you’re so little and frail and what can you do wi -- to help with,” and she was saying, “It’s a mor -- everyone needs to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">If we let them do these things to us and nobody resists, how can we ex-- expect to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The-They’ ll have always an upper hand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But anyway, my parents were -- were terrified, because they didn’t know what the future would bring to her, and to us, if it’s discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">There was -- There were a few things going on, you know, like occasionally leaflets would be distributed by people like her and they -- also there was armed -- armed attacks on the occupation troops and I know -- I could tell what -- something happened because next day or immediately, there would be curfew imposed and even if it happened during a curfew, they just lowered the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Like, in the middle of the summer, I remember curfew was nine o’clock throughout the summer, and then, after an event like that, was reduced to six o’clock and then five and four o’clock in the afternoon, everybody had to be in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So -- And the people, you know, kids, 14 -15, were active participants in these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I’m not saying in the armed attack against the occupation, but leaflets distribution and I don’t know the -- well, they had books that they were reading that were, what’s the word, you know, they were against the current regime and it -- people would be caught sometimes, doing these things and Italians -- I mean, they may have been less brutal than the Germans, but if they would catch somebody, they were not very gentle with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We knew of many people who had gone -- who had been taken and they would send them to some <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> in southern Italy, on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lipari</span> <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> , on the island of Lipari. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And they would come back with all kinds of wild stories, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And I know some people who used to tell us -- well, the mother of some young men who were taken by the Italian troops or Fascists, anyway, they said that they w -- they ironed their backs, you know, with the hot iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But the -- One of the prevalent punishment was castor oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Th-Th-They would force the people to drink a very large container of castor oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I guess like maybe, if we use a measuring cup, like two cups, you know, at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I don’t know if you can imagine the effect of castor oil, but you forget all your trouble -- all your other troubles when you have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So anyway, my parents tried to dissuade my sister from participating and maybe she said that she wouldn’t do it any more, but no, I know she continued in the activities, because at that point, I was reaching the age where I was useful to the cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">This is tape number two, side A. Can you think back to the night that you and your father left, and -- and just tell us a little bit about that, about how you said goodbye and then actually -- where you actually went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Well, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">When -- On this crucial night, I guess, we were awakened by the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">These were the good neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They came knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , banging, and I remember, “Mr. Danon, Mr. Danon,” and, “the Germans are coming.” </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So we got up, took me three seconds to get dressed, my father got dressed and we grabbed our backpacks, which as I mentioned earlier, were packed with whatever we thought was important and that we could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And also, my father and my mother had subdivided whatever valuables they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">In those days, one didn’t carry too much cash, because was losing value, so people would buy -- they called them Napoleons. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It’s like a 20 dollar gold piece, it’s about this size. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And you -- They would sew them in the coats and clothes, so they thought that nobody was going to find them, you know, but everybody knew the -- where to find, in case they were caught by the Germans or the Ustashis. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So -- But anyway, they subdivided what they had and I said goodbye to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I don’t believe my two younger sister were up at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We got out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was, of course, dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They didn’t have street lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They had them on the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> -- on the main <span class="DLF">thoroughfares</span> , but not in our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And we started walking toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , which were not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , because we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I don’t know for -- if you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , you could see how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> 1s flat and then the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> rise up and that’s how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It was near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , you know, flat land and then the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , just all at once, straight up. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So we started walking in that direction and little by little we heard voices and others joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was a mass exodus, because others had heard the same rumor or word that the Germans were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">In the daylight hours, we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">There were <span class="DLF">highways</span> , but the idea was that the Germans were going to come on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> , with their motorized units, so we walked along the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorized units</span> , so we walked along the road -- to the side of the road, and I remember, that was rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I had a good pair of shoes, because my father had just bought himself, me and my sis -- older sister, a pair of shoes -- didn’t buy them, but he engaged a shoemaker to make them for us, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And they were like the ski type, you know, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Shoes that were very well made, the best shoes I ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Anyway, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you think he did that in preparation, in retrospect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Could be, could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Could also be that he wanted to give a job to this one guy, who had come from someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">See, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was full of immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The ti -- during the Italian occupation, Jewish immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We had the community of maybe 200 people, all at once swell to four or 5,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So it was the -- one of my father’s characteristics of engaging people to -- like to coach us in -- well, we didn’t -- we didn’t attend the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , but Italian was a required language, so we had an Italian coach. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And we also had music coach coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , teaching me and my sister, my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And this guy that did our shoes, he was also an immigrant, and all these people were immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Anyway, so we met a lot of people along the way and then finally we got into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and sat down and ate what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And [indecipherable] kept walking some more, until night time and we and many others -- there were other men, mostly men and they were walking to join the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And we all did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And finally we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was held by the partisans, it was a -- like a command type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And we made ourselves known that we want to join them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And they --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Well, because th-they saw us coming, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Of course, th-they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So, some of them approached us and we put little signs, like a little red star, to indicate what we -- what our intentions are. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And they interviewed us and they said, well yeah, sure, but, you know, you just go with the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And little by little, they found odd jobs for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And la -- this was the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They never -- You never came and signed up, you just eventually came to be accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you have to prove yourself at some level?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Well, it wasn’t so formal, allri -- you know, step by step. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Eventually, like I know at one point, I was separated from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was very common, separated and then we meet again and separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I know I was in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- well, near the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> , where there was a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wooden boats</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">This is a coastal area, fishing towns and there was a lot of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> <span class="REGION">coastal area</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing towns</span> and there was a lot of these boats. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Most of them were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sailboats</span> , but small sails, you know, you stick the sail. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , but you take the sail <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then you bring it and you sail. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Some also had motors, but not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Some were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboats</span> , almost like the Phoenician galleys, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But, I remember being in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was night time and there was a bunch of guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Later I learned they were partisans, but they sort of pretended they were fishermen. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And they invited me if I wanted some food, they were cooking something. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Wasn’t beans, was -- they call it Ourzo, but it’s -- that’s a f -- 1t’s not a wheat, it’s a form of a -- what do you call it --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Pasta?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Yeah, it’s -- I think it’s grain, but 1t’s oats, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I think it’s oats and the -- peeled, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But it’s still taste like -- like the horses might like it, but not human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Anyway, so I remember that’s what they served and that’s what they ate and that’s what they gave me some of. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And they were talking about what are they going to do next day and what -- what unit of the Ustashis they were going to attack, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I remember, as I traveled through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , like in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> that were held by the partisans, big point of conversation, you know, would be -- somebody would read the accomplishment of some other units, someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">This wasn’t organized military, this was just somebody in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had attacked Ustashi unit, or Ustashi sympathizers town and had burned so many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and taken so many sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">These were pastoral areas, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> <span class="REGION">pastoral areas</span> , mountains, but still, sheeps were the primary source of income. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So they would say, “Okay comrades, now what are we going to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You know, “Are we going to sit back and relax while our fellow comrades of other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> are doing all these big things?” </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So they would say, “Let’s go and attack them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Well, “How many rifles do we have? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">There is 12 of us, we have three rifles, well,” you know, “how much ammunition? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Maybe we can get some more guns,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So that’s where they would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Sometimes they were successful, sometimes not. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But anyway, so, this how we traveled for -- I don’t visualize right now, how many days or weeks, but we ended up -- I mean, through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , but we ended up again, near the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I was with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And there was one of these wooden junks, was going -- everybody was getting on it, so we got on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And went to one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and I will give you the spelling of the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">H-v-a-r, Hvar. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">That’s -- That’s where I spent a very major part of my time with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So anyway, we went there in the morning -- I mean, this was all -- everything -- movements are made during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Day is for hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">This was the way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You hide during the day, you move during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Tr-Travel, whether it’s on foot or on a donkey, or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mule</span> , or by one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , was always by night and very quietly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  When you and your father left to go join the partisans, how -- what kind of decision was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Was that a political decision, to go fight the good fight, or was it more a decision to -- to s -- to make sure that you and your father would not have to come face to face with the Nazis, to be safe, or how would you characterize the decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Well, the decision to fight never entered my mind nor my father’s mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Yeah, that was my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We were trying to save our skins, frankly. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">My father, let’s see, how old was he at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I would say he was 40, and he had fought in the -- this war that was brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They had general mobilization and he -- he didn’t have very pleasant memories from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know he didn’t care for the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I was much too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I was 13 years old, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I wasn’t going to fight anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So we just left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when we heard the Germans are coming, and there was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go but the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And if you joined the partisans, you’re -- hopefully, you’re with some -- some organize group. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Otherwise, you’re on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And again, the general population of that <span class="REGION">area</span> was peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You know, they live off the <span class="REGION">land</span> , either as shepherds or as farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Once you got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , there was not much farming, except maybe around your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">No extensive farming of any kind, anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">In the <span class="REGION">lowlands</span> , where I lived, they had like -- grapes was the big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And fruit, fruit, different kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Figs, peaches, cherries. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But figs was a big fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They -- you know, there’s a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and squish them for a wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We all have seen movies how that’s done. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Anyway, so after that, it’s nothing else to do the rest of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Well, anyway, so my father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn’t survive in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , among the -- the suther way of life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So, he was out of <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I guess the entire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it’s in the peasant type environment, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know, life, because they were not accustomed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that -- that’s in the Jewish genes, they proved in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that they can be good farmers and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But in this type of situation, we didn’t have that background. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, anyway, we came to the partisans to be a part of a organized society, where we could survive and of course, make our contribution, whatever is needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And we were accepted, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for everybody and once we got into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hvar</span> , they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, too, and I was still 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was placed in a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">That’s -- That’s the best -- the best description of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> was making- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the mi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I remember, oh there were two kids younger than me in this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We were three kids assigned to this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">One was 11 year old, and one was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">All f -- All came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , similar route that we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">What we were doing, actually, is generating power. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It’s a -- like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , you would just go, you know, drive this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , stationary bike, but would generate power for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They weren’t shoeing horses, they were making things out of -- well, let’s say the guns -- I mean the weapons needed certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn’t have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They take a piece of steel and -- and by hand and hammer, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat it and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I remember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we, the kids were doing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting clothes or whatever for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil barrel, split it in half -- and this was pretty heavy steel, split it in half, and finish up th -- with the -- I don’t know -- I didn’t -- don’t know in English how you call these things to - like a file. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn’t scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Then we would take a metal sheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And beat the ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So this was a barrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it closed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You couldn’t just boil it because you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make it, I don’t know what, 400 - 500, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids, did. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hvar</span> , they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and then just lob hand grenade into the small <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And they could do it very silently, so they would not be detected. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup per -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and do this kind of job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Now, in -- in this time that you’re with the partisans, do you have any contact with your sister, who -- who is part of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">My sister -- First of all, partisans had to fight and run and move and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">When we did -- We didn’t know who was alive and who was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We didn’t know -- we left my mother and two sisters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We had no idea whether they were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">My father, one time, was th -- I don’t know whether he was trying to comfort himself, or -- not comfort, but whether he was just trying to be able to talk about it to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He was telling me how, in one of the announcements of the partisans, said how Germans had caught a unit of the partisans from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> and how they -- there was some females, and how they were tortured and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he says, “You think that your sister was one of those girls that they’re talking about?” </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And I said I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I mean, we -- we didn’t -- there was no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Partisans -- Yugoslav partisans were all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it’s like one would not say, let’s say, if somebody wa -- is in the Ame-American army, even today is -- maybe somebody is down <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> and the other is in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">You know, it’s same army, but no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">You don’t know who 1s who, this is war, and it -- they didn’t have, you know, well organized, it was just scattered people and units and no, there was no way one could tell who was where and what and how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  I want to ask you to sort of think -- I want to ask you to think and reflect on your whole family, with this question, which is that, how do you make sense of the fact, that when the war came, everyone in your family was a very tenacious person and survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They met it with tenacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Your sister Blanca went off to fight with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You and your father went off to join the social organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And then, as you said in your first interview, your mother and your sisters -- and your little nine year old sister led your- your mother into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Where do you think that quality came from in your family, of meeting this horrible situation with such determination?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  One, did you ever hear anything about what happened to Jews who stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> when the Germans came, wh-who didn’t go with the partisans, who didn’t go into hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Their end was pretty swift. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They were taken and they were sent to a extermination camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinovats</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> in Croatia called Yasinovats. </span><span class="sentence" id="535"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinovats</span> was a killing field, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> <span class="DLF">killing field</span> , like Auschwitz and Dachau and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And, as we speak, there is a guy that was in charge of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="537">He had a happy life in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , I believe -- is it <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Anyway, he was just recently sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> for trial, but who is going to try him but the same kind of people that were in charge then, his buddies? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I’m sure he will come out smelling like a rose, because they already named <span class="DLF">streets</span> for him as a hero, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So, y-you know</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What’s his name?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  Oh yeah, you just [indecipherable] that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay, and that was the first stop where the Yugoslavs would be going, usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barre</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So one time, my aunt and my cousin from this Santa Croce -- oh, they would come visit us often, and we would go visit them, just you know, maintaining family contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But one time they came and they said, “Well, we want a tip.” </span><span class="sentence" id="679">That’s a tip, they use a Turkish word, means, when you have -- when you’re bearer of good news, you’re supposed to give something like a prize or a tip. “</span><span class="sentence" id="680">What is it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They’re saying, your mother -- my mother, my father’s wife, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barre</span> with the two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And that’s how we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So my uncle, he told my wa -- my mother and my sisters that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lecce</span> , and he -- they went to -- to the authority, the British and told them about it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And they contacted us, they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where my aunts were, and they all came one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I mean, within -- within a week, but by that time, we had already signed up to come to the United -- into <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Stop it for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Anyway, so my mother and my two sisters came and life continued with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  Describe that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">What did your mother say about you? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You must of -- had grown.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  You know, that’s the problem, that -- I like to describe it, but I just don’t have it in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">memory unit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It’s not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I’m trying to retrieve it, it’s not. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">All I remember is the second day, I took my sisters on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And I remember -- well, I had some money and I took them to an <span class="BUILDING">ice cream place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , like in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and throughout Europe, <span class="BUILDING">outdoor cafes</span> were very popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So there was this one <span class="BUILDING">outdoor cafe</span> where we used to go hang out, and my father and me and all our friends would meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">It was called Chinchin, I remember that, na -- yeah, anyway, I took them there and I ordered special ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">It’s called, in Italian, it’s called cassati. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It’s a frozen round thing and you cut pieces and then you put whipped cream on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Anyway, during the war, this was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And I remember, I ordered for them and me and I guess their stomach was not used to it, so both of the gi -- my sisters got sick from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">This is tape number three, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  They both got sick, I remember that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And then the next big thing was getting on the -- the manifest to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">They came -- This was in June, near the end of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Dates escape me right now, but I know we were preparing to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in July and I remember about sixth of July is when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So they didn’t have too much time, they were with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lecce</span> for about six, seven, eight days, no longer than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And again, this was war conditions and we all heard about bureaucracy, how it moves very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">This is one time where bureaucracy moved fast and we were able to put them on the manifest to come over to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Of course, if they couldn’t, we would have just pulled out, but there was the law that was passed, was authorizing 1,000 refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I know must have been tens of thousands, maybe even larger numbers that applied, so this was something special if you were approved. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So, the fact that they recognized the family, this was to their credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And I remember on July 10th, we left -- we boarded military trucks and we left and -- toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> , where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military trucks</span> and we left and -- toward Naples, where the ship was going to take us to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And so, I didn’t have too much time with my sisters, you know, being by ourselves, but once we got on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we went to a -- oh, 1-1t was an abandoned, what do you call it, <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> , where they put us -- this was our not only delousing station, but we received all kinds of shots and you know, tests, medical exams and all that, to see whether we are fit to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We spent three days, and I know I spend it with new friends that I had met. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I was like -- I -- I still was not 14 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I mean, let’s see, this was -- oh, I guess I was 14 already, then. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Yeah, and anyway, I spend it with other boys my age and I saw my sister, she made a lot of friends -- my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I don’t remember my younger sister, because she was with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">But we were pretty extroverted at the time, and we made lots of friends among our own age group, so I know we didn’t spend it as a family unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Can you pinpoint at a time when you -- you saw in your mother and your father, or even felt 1t yourself, where -- where you began to feel like, okay, I think we are safe, we're back together, it looks like we’re going someplace safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Was there a point when you started to relax, or perhaps it was watching your mother and father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">At my age, I don’t think I spent too much time dwelling on safely or anything else, I just lived my life from day to day, having fun in wherever I could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">When I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lecce</span> , I befriended, or I was befriended by a very large number of boys my age, and I met their families and we used to roam the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and I even took up smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was able to get cigarettes when nobody else was, so that wa -- I was the big man on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I quit smoking when my father caught me -- caught smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He didn’t do anything, he says, “Oh, you’re smoking now, congratulations.” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">That was it, yeah, that ended my smoking career. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But anyway, no, I -- I don’t think that I could tell you when I started thinking of safety or security, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Because even under the worst conditions in the partisans, we were just doing what came naturally under the circumstances without too much thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about any memories you might have had of -- of how your mother and father kind of readjusted to each other, or were able to share their experiences with each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Pl tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">My mother was non-communicative a -- when it comes to personal stuff and I spend time with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">My father, I have to say something bad about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He was the -- from the old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where the father was the lord and master, the husband, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He was all powerful and we had no rights whatsoever, except whatever he, by his own grace, bestowed on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Well, so we didn’t have too many close relations with him, except that we didn’t get allowance, so -- but we -- when we would go for a walk, he was the one who would say, “You guys want an ice cream?” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">If he was so moved, you know, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So we tended to hang with him, you know, hang by his -- on his arm, at the expense of our mother, who -- who was working all the time, and couldn’t spend time with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So, I don’t know if their relationship between each other, you know, and there was not too much affection displayed, either between them, or between us, among us kids, cause we didn’t know how to express it. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We learned it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I think I learned it from my younger sister, the affection, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But, no, I just cannot say anything about that, because that was not out in the open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  If you could just talk a little bit about what the experience of spending all that extra time with your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You were, essentially, sometimes you were separated, but you were really with him, day and day and day and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I’m just curious if --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Okay, well, let me tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">When we were in the partisans, we -- 1f we marched, I was usually ahead in the <span class="DLF">marching line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">He -- He had more problems, physical problems, than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Then, when we were assigned to different -- to the units, he was in charge of the supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">He was like a supply sergeant and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We spend an awful lot of time in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , from morning til night. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">We’d come to meals, sometimes I would see my father then, sometimes I wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I would see him at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Since there was no lights, we burned the kerosene. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Home made lamp, that was the way of light, because during the war, it was the situation where you didn’t have -- even if there was electricity, 1t was either bombed out, or they didn’t have the oil to burn it so they can generate electricity or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Coal, whatever was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And it was small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so everybody had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kerosene lamps</span> and they were put out very early in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You only burned them when you had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So, it was sleeping time and get up early in the morning and go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And we had our own individual functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , after we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lecce</span> , my father -- this a funny -- not a funny s -- well, it’s a funny story, but as a result of this funny story, and I'll tell you about it if you care to hear it, my father got a job as acensor. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">This is the military censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They would, the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> -- every letter was opened, read, regardless of what the language was written in, and they either cut it out or blackened the parts that they didn’t want to remain there. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So my father had the job and I was roaming the <span class="DLF">street</span> with my new f -- new found friends and life was beautiful and it did not center around my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We -- I mean, we didn’t have especially close relations, we didn’t have antagonistic relations, just how was your day, okay, I would -- I even would sometimes attempt cooking, you know, so when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we would have a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We lived with a family, an older lady and her adopted daughter and I would help them -- help the older lady in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> sometimes, because we would sometimes provide the food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So, I guess they would let me make the hamburgers, because the meat would come out of cans -- corned beef cans that I had bought or traded or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So, like I said, I wasn’t too close th -- in contact with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">But how my father got this job, was one time we were on the <span class="DLF">street</span> walking and there was a guy whispering behind us, and -- whispering with somebody and they were following a couple of American officers and they were -- one was listening to what they’re saying and he would interpret it to the other guy, and I nudged my father, and I said, “Look, I think their spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They’re trying to hear whatever the American fly boys -- American Air Force officers tell them about where they are going to bomb, or what they destroyed, or whatever, and then he tells the other guy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So, I -- I told my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So we -- my father and I decided to follow this one guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So anyway, we followed them -- these two guys, we followed them and then one guy went in a -- what do you call those? </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It’s like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> , horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> thing, but it’s like the kind that they have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , around <span class="REGION">Columbus area</span> .</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="809">We were interviewed and assigned to a grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And frankly, I think unfairly in some cases, because the selection was made on basis of our knowledge of English language, I didn’t know any English, so I was put in seventh grade, even though I was 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But, you know, people who spoke English, some of my friends, too, were sent to <span class="BUILDING">local high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So I felt a little bit of a -- not resentment, but that I was set back unfairly. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">But, thinking back, all I had from the <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , was -- like I had completed four years of schooling, and a portion of the fifth year, which in our case was <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So they put me in seventh grade, lower seventh, th -- you start with seven A, then you go to seven B, eight A to eight B, so -- so they put me in seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Anyway, a typical day would be, you get up, you eat breakfast in the <span class="INT_SPACE">communal kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We had -- thousand people were assigned to three <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> , three <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">You eat breakfast, after breakfast, you start walking toward the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">You usually -- during breakfast time, you meet some of your fellow walkers to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that we went to, was couple miles, I would say maybe three, four miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">You go out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you sign out. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">There’s a guard -- we used to call them policemen, because they had a police uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">There’s a guard, he watches you sign in and me and my friends would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would start, I believe about eight 15 or so, would be over by 11:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We would go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for lunch, back to the community kitchens, have lunch, back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span> , have lunch, back to school for the afternoon session. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Yeah, it was, I guess, like here, except here <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , you have lunch period and you have <span class="INT_SPACE">lunch rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We didn’t have <span class="INT_SPACE">lunch rooms</span> , this was -- this was called <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , I guess, and even if we did, we just didn’t carry lunches. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">We -- I don’t think they would let us carry it, because that was reserved for those who traveled long distances, and we had, within couple of miles, our own facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And there was an hour and a half or so for lunch, maybe even longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So, you know, it -- we were pressed for time. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Anyway, we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we were in the military -- formerly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> , which had all kinds of sports facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I mean, you know, running track, <span class="DLF">field</span> , and we had organized our own clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">We had taken old <span class="INT_SPACE">supply rooms</span> and converted them to clubs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Our -- And we had Ping Pong, that was a biggy for us, playing Ping Pong the whole afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> didn’t give us homework, which was unusual for us, we were used to European style, where you get a lot of homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Anyway, so, play Ping Pong, then go to supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Usually, during the lunch hour and supper, there would be somebody announcing what’s taking place, in the evening, there’s usually a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We would get some real nice movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I don’t know whether the camp administration would buy them, or this was donated or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We’d get movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">They had people, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> organized theatrical groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">There was always something going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">If it’s not movie, it’s a play, if it’s not a play, it’s some kind of discussion, debates, our club, we had youth clubs, we had our own personal clubs, that -- Yugoslav youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">There was newspaper, magazines. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But just hanging out, going to the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> , which is -- there were -- the-they sold ice cream and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">You know, the kids like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And, when came winter month, well -- I forgot something. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">They had a unit of Quakers that came -- well, Quakers, Friend’s service, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It’s a religious group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Quakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Yeah, but it’s -- was sponsored by qu -- Quakers, but they were like social -- social service and they would help us organize games and do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Like one of them was in charge of Girl Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">My sisters keeps talking about how -- all the activities they did as Girl Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Another one would get the grown-ups to -- for sing-a-long and play games and you know, different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And this one was sort of helping us -- I guess teenagers, younger teenagers and she one time helped us build a <span class="BUILDING">skating rink</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We did it -- We got a shuf -- shovels from the department of sanitation, I want to say, but you know, garbage collectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We got shovels, we got wood from the carpentry office so-someplace in the ca- within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="BUILDING">carpentry office</span> so-someplace in the ca- within the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And we just dug wherever we could, you know, made it flat and put the boards along and we flooded it, and sure enough, it froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Not very evenly, but it was a <span class="DLF">Skating rink</span> , and you know, anybody who could get skates and a bunch of brooms to guide yourself so you won’t fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  Brooms’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  Brooms, it’s like skis, you know, handles, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">That’s what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Some people knew how to skate well, but I had to use two brooms, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Anyway, so activities were just plentiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Food was absolutely fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Good, plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">That was one of the things that the grown-ups that were there, you know, many of them, especially my parents, they thought that life had settled for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">This is manna from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , we’re going to live like this forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">No worries, everything is going to be provided. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they had a, you know, a rude awakening, but during the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , was good for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And I know my mother kept remembering how life was terrific and just a big change from whatever they did, whatever was taking place before, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  What was the feeling among your parents, did -- at this point -- let me ask it like this, when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , there was an agreement that this was temporary, that you would go back to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">What did people say to each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Were they beginning to say they might like to stay, or di -- you know, especially as they saw what was playing out with the war, what were people saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  Well, there was a lot of different opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">A lot of people had relatives here in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , especially, many of them, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and they wanted to rejoin their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Some people had relatives left in other parts of the coun -- of Europe, and they didn’t know what was going on, so they wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But needless to say, that when the <span class="DLF">gates</span> sort of opened, and we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , not too many wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">There was a first -- first time when they said, “Who wants to go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Now is the time to do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Only 13 people went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Second time was a few more. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">My aunt -- One of my aunts and her husband and the daughter, they went back, because they had two other children that -- they learned about their survival and just so happened that both of their daughters were -- they had distinguished themselves, you know, in the war, both with the partisans and later, the civil administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So -- And this aunt and uncle of mine, their family, they were so close, you ask me about my parents, how close they were and I couldn’t tell you, but I can tell you about this aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They were always -- I mean, they displayed their affections to each other and both the parents and the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They were really close, the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Tell us their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  Their name -- It was my mother’s oldest sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Her name was Bukeetsa, which means first born. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And she married this man, his name was Joseph and their last name was Monteelio. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">You might -- You might be surprised, all these names, they sound Italian, my mother’s name, Kabiljo, Monteelio. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They did have Italian names. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They came, evidently, through some of the Italian areas, but what I was going to say, there’s a lot of Sephardic names that sound Italian, that the Jews in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> <span class="REGION">Italian areas</span> , but what I was going to say, there’s a lot of Sephardic names that sound Italian, that the Jews in these areas were -- Sephards are very few and far between. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">They wonder, what was it -- What was your name before you changed it? </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Well, it was the same, you know, it just -- different names. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Anyway, so there was, if you read this book, “The Haven,” this lady, Ruth Gruber.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  This is the book by Ruth Gruber, right, excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  Ruth Gruber, she describes about all the political gyrations that took place during the time, which were not within my knowledge, because I didn’t dwell on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">This is tape number three, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, we had my older sister, we found out where she was and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And we -- we were thinking of bringing her over here instead of us going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So we didn’t even entertain a thought of going back, if we could remain here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  Can you -- At this point, does -- what does your father know of his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  My father didn’t know anything about his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He assumed that they were dead immediately after they were taken and he was saying the memorial prayers for them, right away, I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  Who told him that they saw them taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  Well, 1-immigrants were coming o -- you know, s -- some who were able to escape and they’d come -- everybody was coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , if they could, from other parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">If you envision <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> the way it was and here is one little, coastal sliver, that swa -- occupied by Italians, and the word gets around that you can survive there, everybody tries to go there, no matter what -- what -- no matter what the cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So, lots of people came to <span class="REGION">Italian held areas</span> and they talk about “Yeah, I saw your parents being taken,” you know, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And -- Or people say, “Anybody left?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="910">No, nobody left,” of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> , here, there, you know, so that was pretty well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  Y-You say your father was saying the memorial prayer, did -- did he ever make it a formality and ask you to join him and say this as a kind of a service for his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  No, no, he -- he thought -- I guess this is what he had, a premonition that they died, certain day and that’s how he a-assumed and he -- th-that day, he decided they died, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">This was, I guess he needed it, you know, to what we -- what do we call here, closure, or something, yeah, in today-speak, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned in your first interview, the feeling of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , of that it was enclosed. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I don’t know if there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> or barbed wire, and just some of the feelings that that sparked among people, par-par-particularly you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  Well, you know, this was the big thing, when newspeople came to interview us, all over -- I mean, New York Times said there was a lady a-and she asked, “What do you like about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And is there anything ya -- what did -- don’t you like?” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And then she quoted us yelling the word for barbed wire, is zhitsa, and says -- she quotes, “Zhitsa, they all yelled in unison,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">No, this is a rebellious spirit in a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">You know, somebody’s trying to chain me, and that was it, but aside from not being able to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , except later, they allowed us so many visits or -- within such a radius of 20 miles and special dispensation to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , which was maybe 30 miles, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">No, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Even the quote zhitsa, didn’t bother us that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Life was pretty smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">No matter -- If I think, in retrospect, wherever I was, wh-wherever I might have been, I watch today’s youth, you know, I had everything there, we all did. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">No, absolutely, there was no complaints, except the psychological first impression to a rebellious teenager, you know, that when you see a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So that was not a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  You mentioned again -- In your first interview, you mentioned the Japanese internment and I ha -- a -- maybe suggested a parallel there. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I-I-Is that something you have any thoughts on, or did back then, I don’t know if you were sa -- aware, you know, aware of the fact that the same administrators that administered the Japanese internment camps, were administering your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Japanese internment camps</span> , were administering your camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I -- I don’t know if --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, we were not aware of the internment of the Japanese Americans until much later, yeah, when we learned, you know, in our history, after we were released from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But the only reason I mention it, is because I wanted to convey to whoever I was talking to, that this was the administration that was in charge of us, the very same one that was in charge of the Japanese, and I -- my guess was going to be that they -- the Japanese were - Japanese Americans were treated just as well as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I couldn’t see any reason why they wouldn’t ha-have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">But, basically, 1t was the same administration, was called War Relocation Authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And then for us, they had a separate segment, it was called emergency refugee center, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> <span class="BUILDING">emergency refugee center</span> , Oswego, New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But it was the same administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">You know, they had the same machinery in motion. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So, that’s the only reason I mentioned it, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Can you talk -- You alluded to it a little bit ago, can you talk about the transition from leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , to having to really strike out and set up life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and- and tell us some of the things that happened right before you left, and -- and sort of take us through that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  Well, what happened to us was, I mean, we had to leave and we all left. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But before that, there was a group that had sponsored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> government was not allowing, in those days, of free entry to the people who sought immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They wanted somebody to put a bond, monitor a bond, to guarantee that we would not become a public charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So this organization, the Jewish organization called Jewish American Joint Distribution Committee, put the funding -- in other words, they guarantee that -- they guarantee that we would not become a public charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So, what they were trying to do is, people who are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they were trying to disperse them, so they wouldn’t all go to New York, because they had the mechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because that’s a big burden on one <span class="NPIP">location</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they were trying to disperse them, so they wouldn’t all go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , because they had the mechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same place, because that’s a big burden on one location. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So, they interviewed everybody and they convinced my parents to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They told them what a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> it is, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , there is a Sephardic synagogue, which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic synagogue</span> , which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second synagogue in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Now, the first one was on the Cape -- I’m sorry, first one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newport</span> , Connectic -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newport</span> , <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">It’s called su -- Truro synagogue, same as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="BUILDING">Truro synagogue</span> , same as a town on the Cape, so strike that out, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But anyway, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , there is a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where George Washington had visited there, yeah, so they talked to us about history, you know, and that, “You will be welcome there,” and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Okay, so my father wen -- okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Some of our friends went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , be -- this one guy told us later, he agreed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , that part, more, m- O-r-e, means sea in Serbo-Croatian, so he thought he would going to be near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serbo-Croatian</span> , so he thought he would going to be near the sea. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Well, close enough, but not exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Anyway, so different people went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but I would say not too many went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha</span> , <span class="REGION">Nebraska</span> , or you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caspar</span> , <span class="REGION">Wyoming</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Still, 1t was either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LA</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="REGION">Philadelphia area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">So, when we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we had to go someplace, because we were under the quota and Yugoslav quota was not very large, like maybe six a year or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But, I think my parents, because they were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , which at the time they were born, was under the Austro-Hungary empire, I think they put them under Austrian quota, which was much larger. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So -- Still, they decided to close the <span

<p>QUESTION:  Do you -- Do you remember what it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  Yeah, 50 cents an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And I remember, after the first month, I had to go -- no, I didn’t have to, but I went, asked for a raise, and it was a nickel, so I was making 55. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And then they passed a law that made it, the minimal 55 and I felt cheated. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So next month I got another nickel raise and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But that was some really hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I worked there harder than I ever did anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">If you can imagine, hats are made from felt, heavy felt and steam. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So you shape it with steam and in the summer, lots of steam is just not conducive to a well-being of a person, like myself, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Anyway, so I worked there, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  B-Before you go on, why -- why didn’t you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Well, was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Wha -- Who made that decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  The de-decision was made by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">We didn’t have any money, that was the decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">He didn’t want to work, so I was the only one over 16, so the idea was that I was going to earn something, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And, as the customs of the times were, all children turned over their paycheck -- that’s mailman -- turned over their paycheck to their father, and I was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And if I could work extra, or overtime, and all that, that was -- I was proud to bring a bigger check. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Little by little my checks became, like 18 dollars clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Fi-First it was like 14 something and with the taxes deducted, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Then it got to be 16 - 18 and then finally I started making like a dollar an hour, God, I thought I was really the highest paying employee anywhere, and with overtime, I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Why didn’t your father want to work? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">At this point, he must have been about 45 or 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">He didn’t want to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He was never much for working, even when we were kids, when we had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He said it was his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and my -- he would say my mother was like an employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But he never went to work there, very rarely would he go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And if he would go, he would like, make it by 11 o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And people would wait for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">You know, customers would line up, sometimes wait for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">People from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , who sold their foods and wares and like the milk lady, she would come early, deliver milk, and then with the money that she would collect, she has to buy a -- supplies or whatever, including material for clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So they would wait for him, they never knew when he was going to show up, 10:30 - 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But anyway, he was not a working person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So, eventually, I got my employer to offer him a job, and he did try, for awhile, but 1t was too hard for him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So he didn’t -- he just never worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Yeah, he would -- My two sisters were young, you know, they were under 16, so they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And then my mother found a job with some local family that was making aprons, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And she was just folding them and packaging them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Not much of a job, but that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">But they didn’t need her, they didn’t need a full time employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So, eventually, my mother found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a -- a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> -- clothing, men’s clothing factory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">That was big industry there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But I was the one that provided the main sustenance, you know, for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And, after the first, maybe four months -- like we came in February, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , I got this job after we left this <span class="BUILDING">country club</span> , in April and next September, I signed up for <span class="BUILDING">evening school</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And from then on, I went to <span class="BUILDING">evening school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">First high school, then, you know, <span class="BUILDING">college</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , then, you know, college. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Seems like 15 years of evening -- <span class="BUILDING">evening school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">But anyway - yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">QUESTION:  Why did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  Because, I had completed -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , where we were signed up, I started seventh grade, and as soon as I learned the language, got on the dean’s list, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Let’s face it, I was 14, and the kids in that class were 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Yeah, so it -- I don’t want to attribute to myself any superior intelligence, but I was older, so my brain should function a little better than a younger kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">So, anyway, so I would be promoted every couple of months, to the next grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So, in the -- what, in a year and a half, I had completed three years of <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , seventh, eighth and ninth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And, incidentally, all the kids in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> were not only on dean’s list, but they were like top honors, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">They used to call it high honors and we had to march to the stage, where the principal would shake our hand and hand us the report card, whereas others would get it in their <span class="INT_SPACE">classrooms</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Anyway, this was during the assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But, so I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I would also take tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">What -- These were like Regency tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">It was uniform test, GD, I guess they call it, about each individual subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">What -- We had an advantage, I spoke many languages by that time, and other languages have much more complex grammars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And American kids have problems knowing when to say me, or I, or him, or he, or -- you know, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And I would take these tests, English tests, and I mean, y-you just listen to your ear and think about another language, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So, you have maybe two cases or three cases nominative, or objective and maybe possessive, which is -- we had seven of them, you know, and all of these different tenses in verbs and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So it was very easy, I mean, except for spelling and pronunciation, English came pretty easy to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">But anyway, the point 1s, I was able to take all these tests and move up my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I graduated from high school, and then went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and then went to college.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">QUESTION:  How old were you at that point, when you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  Well, I gr-graduated --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1054">ANSWER:  Yeah, I graduated in about a year and a half and so I was like 18 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">18 -- 18 anda half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I know, less than 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And then I started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But this was, in those days, they didn’t have like all, every evening, for four hours in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Don’t forget, I was working full time, overtime occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">So, I would just go two hours at night, to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And it took awhile, until, well, at one point, much -- not much later, but in 1950, there was a war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and I was just the right age for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So they tried to draft me, but I got a couple of deferments, because I was the sole support of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">But that didn’t last forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So, eventually, I got drafted and well, I got drafted in the month that they declare end of the war, in January ‘55. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So, after serving my [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">ANSWER:  I want to go back, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Anyway, I was drafted in January, 1955, and after serving my basic training, I was sent to Europe, yeah, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Well, that didn’t go over too well with me, because of my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I didn’t think 1t was too safe to keep me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Safe for maybe somebody else, because I might be armed and might decide that the -- you know, to provide justice for myself or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But anyway, the point was, I was, when I was inducted into the army, they give you a battery of tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And one of the things that they decided that I would be pretty good for, filling an interpreters position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And interpreters are mostly needed in <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So they trained me to be an infantryman, and they send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I spoke some German, but not enough to be an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Then I told them that I wasn’t happy, so within eight days or so, they send me to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">QUESTION:  Did you explain to them why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I mean this, your personal history in context?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I explained that to the chaplain, not to anybody in the chain of command, because I don’t think the army would accommodate anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So I guess he talked to whoever was in the personnel office, when they were filling quotas for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">In those days, we maintained what was known as communication zone in s -- in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so I was sent to a place near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Well, it was like a <span class="BUILDING">regional hospital</span> , regional POL. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">That stands for petroleum, oil and lubricants, and the other [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They were all from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , all the way to the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> , where we maintained our native strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So anyway, so I was sent there to interpret French, which I didn’t know a single word of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And the commanding officer insisted that I was filling the slot, and he wanted me to interpret, so six weeks later, when he called me, I interpreted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Anyway, so that’s -- I spend a year and a half in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>

A clarification, at this point, are- are you a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  I obtained my citizenship as soon as I was enti -- eligible for it, within five years of residence, which was something one strived for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I know I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I know my parents did and everybody that I knew that was in similar situation like I was, strived for, with pride.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Well, that was my other question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">At that point, what were your feelings about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  I’m -- Well, how does one say I would be top patriot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I would offer myself and whatever, you know, like they said in the signing the Declaration of Independence, our bodies and fortunes and whatever else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I mean, I had great feelings about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I still do, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I may have political differences with some of the foreign policy, or maybe even internal policies, but you know, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which provided a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me is utmost in my esteem, for -- unquestionably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  So when -- So when you were called to serve, and it was clear that -- that you needed to do so and that your family would be taken care of, I guess -- I guess what I want to ask is, what was your attitude when you went to serve in the army, representing the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">ANSWER:  Okay, well first, a slight correction would be that my family would not be cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">They have, you know, allotment, but they’re not sufficient to maintain oneself, especially this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Well, my sisters were already getting older, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I mean, they -- they could go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I don’t know if it’s both sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Let’s see, in 1950, no, my one sister would be -- ‘31, she was 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">No, 18, at that time, so she was working already, the -- the one next to me, but the youngest one was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">So, this is the sister that I mentioned to you that, pretty strong willed, and she, as soon as she started working, she says, “Well, my money, the one -- the money that I earn, is mine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And she had problems with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">He insisted that 1t was his. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So they came up to some compromise, but still, not enough to maintain the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">You know, she was making like 25 dollars or so a week and she settled for contributing 15 maybe, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">It -- Not maybe, but that’s the number that I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  This is Esther?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  No, this is Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The -- The one that when she was nine was guiding my mother, pulling her by the hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Anyway, so that was the other source of income, and my mother, she would work, or wouldn’t work, depending on the situation where she was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">They had layoffs, and she wasn’t very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">She couldn’t -- She couldn’t manage on the piecework, so they had to pay her the minimum wage, and they were not happy to pay minimum wage to somebody who could not earn it under the piecework system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So my mother would be the first one to get laid off and the last to be re-hired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So, anyway, that’s why I say my family would not be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">But, when my younger sister started working and the allotment, you know, and all that, then I -- I di -- I agreed that, okay, my family could survive without my full support.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  The allotment was what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">ANSWER:  The allotment in those days was based on my salary, which was 78 dollars, so from that, I needed to contribute something, and the government would contribute something also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I remember later, when I got a promotion, and -- well, whatever it was, increase in pay, that the government’s contribution would be 105 dollars a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">But we ended up, my father was afraid to sign anything, and so h-he never signed the application for allotment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">He -- After we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he was totally -- not devastated, but destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I mean, his psyche was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">He -- He thought that -- that people were looking at him, the secret police was watching him, you know, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">It was -- mentally, he had problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And he wouldn’t leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he would stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , all the time peek from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So he was not capable of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And he was afr - like I said, afraid to sign any documents, for fear that might -- it might be some form of a commitment or something, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">QUESTION:  So, in a sense, you really were in charge of the family, after this -- at this point your father became somewhat disabled by --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, but --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- it sounds like some sort of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1139">ANSWER:  Yeah, but he still maintained the control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">This was -- Yeah, you don’t dethrone a king just because he 1s not functioning in the most efficient manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So this was one of the friction points in our lives, and it took long time to resolve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">In fact, it wasn’t -- it was never resolved, except when I came back from the military, 1t was a financial settlement kind of thing, that we decided how much we’re going to provide for him and whatever he does with it, 1t’s okay with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">QUESTION:  Us being who?</span></p>

advanced -- advanced school. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">In fact, you get a BA when you graduate from that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Anyway, and that was his future, he found friends, he developed different friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">But the older brother, this fellow by name of Raymond Barney, he was a friend of mine from then on, I mean, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">In fact, when I was in the military service, I was stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and they’re French, yeah, and he came to visit me and we sort of got our signals mixed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We were supposed to meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and I went there for a week, and he wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And then I came back and he was waiting for me near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , in my installation, but I had already shot my vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And anyway, so we were good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And then, while I was in the service, he met a girl and he married her, and she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , so he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But, when I came back from the service, I was -- I started dating some other girl, and I dated her for like three, four years, but 1t was just Saturday night kind of thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">We had a standing Saturday

class="BUILDING">resorts</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catskill</span> , she met somebody that was more serious than me, so that ended that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And then, in one of my summer evening classes, there was a bunch of girls -- this was Spanish class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I was trying to get some college credits in a hurry, so I would attend -- let’s say I would attend advance college course, but they wouldn’t give me credit unless I had some of the other preliminaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So I would take an exam in the preliminary, pass that and have the advance course, which I had to sit for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And this was advanced Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">So sh-she saw I had a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">It was a monogram ring that had turned itself around and she thought I was married, so she thought I was safe, nobody would say that, you know, that she was hitting on me, to use the current colloquial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And so she would come and sit like next to me and I won’t say copy, but we would work the homework together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And it was a very happy group, like about eight girls and two guys and we would go after <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , we go out, celebrate, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And that girl, when I decided to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , get a job someplace else, I left her, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And then one year I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Catskills</span> and lo and behold, we met again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And that was my wife for 30 years, and she passed away a year ago.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">QUESTION:  I just have a couple more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">You mentioned to me, before we began this interview, that when you did your videotaped interview in 1989, it was one of the first time you’d really talked about the fact that you’d -- that -- that you’re a survivor, you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1423">QUESTION:  -- you had it -- an experience in the war that many others have had and I’m just curious about that, why you didn’t talk about it, and then, at what point after you did begin to talk about it, did it shift a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1424">ANSWER:  Okay, well, no, the reason I didn’t talk about, 1s because I didn’t believe in victimization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I didn’t want to center my life around history, memories and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Lots of people have adverse conditions in their earlier parts of their lives, and if they dwell on it and make their whole life based on their victimhood, if you will, then they’re not going to be very functional. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I did not want to think about those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">But then later, when I was being pressed by different people, including my sister -- my younger sister, Esther, why don’t I join the survivor’s groups and why don’t I do things to, you know, to bring out situations, to sort of tell people about our history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I -- For awhile I said, ““What’s the point, what’s the point?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">But then they might think that I was being obsessive on that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">So I said, “Okay, so if that’s what you think I should do, fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And that’s when Martin Goldman asked me to do this video and this -- the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was getting ready to put out that book a year or two later and like -- when was it, recently, there’s a Jewish in - there is a day in the Jewish calendar called Yom HaShoah, which is a Holocaust memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Shoah means Holocaust in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">I was asked to give it -- a speech, a talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">In fact, they asked me to read this letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">It’s like a memorial service for -- for the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">This was in this <span class="REGION">northern Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Different <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> ha -- different years they hold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">So I spoke at my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> one year and last year was to another -- when I say I spoke to my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , it was a community -- not celebration, what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">Commemoration like --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">And I spoke to another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reston</span> last year, which had this community service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And so, today I have no problem talking, although you did see how at certain points, I get a little choked up, but it’s not an obsession with me, either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And it’s not a big event that made me either block it or release it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">No, it just sort of flowed on itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">This is tape number five, side A, however, this is being done a week later, on March fifth, 1999. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">We are still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , it is just another day and it is still a follow up interview to the first videotaped interview with Isak Mike Danon, of November six, 1989. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">I want you to think back to that period when you have your first job, you’re working 1n that felt <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">You have described it as very difficult, you also describe your whole family as living like church mice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">Can you remember at all what was in your mind that kept you going, or that you were striving towards? </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">What -- What was giving you strength?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">ANSWER:  Well, I di -- I don’t remember ever thinking too deeply about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">I know somebody in our family had to earn a living and I was the logical candidate at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I was also having fun with -- with the kids my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">We would -- I would say we would run that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , you know, we’d go wild sometimes, get yelled at, you know, things that 16 year old do, 16 - 17 - 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And that’s how the time passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And of course, one thing, I always tried to work overtime, to earn a few dollars extra, because I knew the need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And later on, maybe I was a little bit resentful that I had to turn over my entire check to my father, but I guess we just lived on, you know, from day to day and like I said, I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had too many other things on my mind that were more important than worrying about injustice and hard work and all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1459">QUESTION:  Y-You mentioned turning over your check to your father, and in our interview a week ago, you talked about your younger sister, at a certain point, when she began earning money, refused to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">She said, “Nope, this is my money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">How do you explain -- I mean, she grew up in the same family, how do you explain her rebellion, really, against this sort of family authority? </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">You were the good son, you were doing what you were supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">Your younger sister, Sarah said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">And so she had acquired a different mindset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1465">ANSWER:  Well, I guess she became Americanized earlier than I did, that’s one possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Another possibility is when she started working, which was several years later, after she graduated from high school, at that time, I guess I was earning a little bit more, my mother already started making some money -- not much, in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , at that time, I guess I was earning a little bit more, my mother already started making some money -- not much, in the factory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And so, th-things weren’t as tight as they used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Plus, both my d -- my sister and I would be -- s-started going out, you know, so you spend some money and the need is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And so she got backbone earlier than I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1470">QUESTION:  You said maybe she was Americanized earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Wh-What -- What finally Americanized you, or ha -- when you think back on it, when did you first start to see some ideas that you would consider American and not Yugoslavian, old -- old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1472">ANSWER:  Well, maybe it’s not Americanization, maybe it’s gen -- a generation gap, that started sinking into my psyche, you know, my mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">I don’t know what -- at what point I started and what did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I guess I started going out with some of the friends that -- where I worked, in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">And also <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I started dating a young lady in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">So, you know, you pick up things here and there, and you -- especially now, you -- and I had the support from my younger sister, so that was the point where I could assert myself in that particular <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">But there were other things where I had differences with my father and I asserted myself to a -- to certain extent, but as I look back all the way to my life, I was always low profile, always avoiding confrontations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">So maybe that’s the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">May -- May not be Americanization at all, just the term that I use to explain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1480">QUESTION:  When you think of your friends, h-how would you describe them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">Were they a -- a mixture, or did you tend to become friendly with other immigrants, within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">How would you describe the people that you were spending time with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1483">ANSWER:  Okay, there were three or four families that came from Fort Ontario with us and is several in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> with us and is several in Philadelphia, there weren’t too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And my parents were in constant contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">They would meet once a month for like, what do you call it, potluck kind of affairs at different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">But I was very close with a family -- not family, but with two boys who were from <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And I might have mentioned it in the earlier interview, two brother, by name of Barney. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">They were French and -- French and Bulgarian, but they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And the older one, Raymond Barney remained my very best friend, all throughout my younger days, but much of my limited recreational activity was also with my co-workers in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they were 100 percent Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">They were un -- living under the same restraints and restriction and limitations that I had, because their parents had the same kind of rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">The parents, or grandparents had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they were like second generation Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">So, I hung out with them and we would go on vacations to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">So, one more <span class="REGION">area</span> where I made friends, was every Sunday afternoon, we would go to the Jewish Y in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Y</span> in Philadelphia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And that’s where -- for working out, swimming, and after that, we go maybe to a movie, or <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1496">QUESTION:  With your Italian friends, were you speaking Italian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1497">ANSWER:  No, no, they -- they just knew few key words, which they couldn’t be mentioned in mixed company in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">But anyway, no, they would take me to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and I would talk to their parents or grandparents, Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">But their Italian left something to be desired, because they spoke dialect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Many of them did not know the real Italian language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And Italian has so many dialects, like one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that’s separated from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by 30 - 50 miles, they don’t understand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">That’s -- You know, they were city - states in the olden days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1503">QUESTION:  And then with Jewish friends, were -- what were you speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1504">ANSWER:  Oh, my Jewish friends, we s -- they didn’t speak Jewish, this is a younger generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">And I don’t speak Jewish, so -- no, we spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">All the young people, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">We had, I forget how many different nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I think they said 160 or something, you know, large number of different nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And English language was the unifying element.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1510">QUESTION:  S-So, by the time you’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , how is your English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1511">ANSWER:  Oh, my English was quite good within a month or two that we were in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">No, I -- When it comes to learning languages -- and I have a little key thought on that -- when it comes to learning languages, total immersion is the only answer in my mind, because I saw how long it took us from nothing to total, well, fluency, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">When we came to Fort Ontario, when we started going to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , what happened, they put us in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , when we started going to schools, what happened, they put us in a school with the rest of the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">There was no issue, you know, you speak this language or you speak that language, so keep you separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">So, for awhile we just sat there, like bumps on the log, you know, not doing anything or not responding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">But, it was sinking in and I remember like in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went to, we had maybe about 16 - 17 kids from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">I was the first one that got on the dean’s list, and that was within second -- well, the second report card period, and we had six each year, like three in the first semester, and three in the second -- every six or seven weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">So, I got on the dean’s list the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">The very next time, was three of us, but the others were on the high ca -- high honors and I was still on the dean list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">Next semester I got on the high honor list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">It was like a competition, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">And the language was not a barrier, especially we excelled in English grammar, because there was no grammar to worry about, actually, whereas the kids that were born here, they struggled, they didn’t know objective case from nominative case, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">We were familiar with other languages, which had much more complex grammatical structures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">So, that and of course, many of us were a little bit older than the other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">Not all, but I was older than others in my fir -- class, where I was first assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">So, they kept promoting us, you know, social promotions, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And the language was the easiest thing to absorb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">That was not an issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">QUESTION:  What were your parents speaking at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1530">ANSWER:  My parents spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Serbo-Croatian, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> , which is --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1531">ANSWER:  -- yeah, if you -- if you remember, I explained last time what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">QUESTION:  Did you ever learn to speak Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1534">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1535">ANSWER:  No, we were not exposed to that particular a-area of, you know, people who came from where Yiddish was spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1536">QUESTION:  You were Sephardic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">ANSWER:  We -- Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">Ours was what we call Sephardic, so yeah, Ladino was the spoken tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1539">QUESTION:  I want you to think back about -- we’ve been talking a lot about what was going on with you, but what was going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">I want to know if you have any memories, in 1954, up to 1960 - ‘61, of the beginnings of the struggle for American Blacks to get equality in education? </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Do you remember hearing about that, thinking about that, even witnessing anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1542">ANSWER:  Well, let me take you back a few years, to 1944, when we were put in, in these classes with regular American kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And I, and many of my contemporaries, the immigrants, we were very, Ill use the word rebellious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">We couldn’t absorb the American way of, I am number one, always yelling, you know, because some of the proverbs that I knew, and that we were brought up under, tell you, if you’re the one that’s praising yourself, you must be pretty low on the totem pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">So we did not accept when the teachers in the Social Science class -- Social Studies class would tell us how Americans have the great democracy and you know, justice for all and saying your Pledge of Allegiance, allegiance with liberty and justice for all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And we would say, “Yeah, what about the Negroes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">That was the term that was used in those days. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1548">What about the Negroes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">And one time the teacher says, “I’m sick and tired of you guys bringing this up,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">And then I would start saying, “Well, how about if I mention <span class="REGION">South America</span> and all that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">Now, we were politically aware of what was going up, so this is like an introduction, so you can see what was in back of our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">When the -- When the Negro movement started coming out, you said in ‘54, I was totally involved in my studies and you know, work full time and trying to take as many credit -- credit hours that I could at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and there were too many things on my mind to get involved politically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I -- I sympathized with the cause, but there were other conflicting things, such as I was attending a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , called Temple University, which was located in a section which was referred to by the newspapers as quote, The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Jungle</span> <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> , which was located in a section which was referred to by the newspapers as quote, The Jungle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">So I really -- night I would have to come there and try to park my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and it was located on Broad Street, which was a pretty well lit <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="DLF">Broad Street</span> , which was a pretty well lit street, but then it extended several blocks deep, into what I would call projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">They were pretty poor <span class="REGION">areas</span> , they were hundred percent Black. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And that was pretty dangerous, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">Every so often there were killings and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">So, I don’t know -- I - I cannot recall how this conflict played in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">Struggle for independence versus the criminal elements that were roaming in their <span class="REGION">sections</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">So, I just don’t know how I felt about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">But later on, when <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> was came, then I started participating, because, yeah I was fully free of all my educational requirements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I had graduated from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> by then and I was doing mostly traveling at that time, so my time was free, and I was one of the protesters at one time or another, for different causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1563">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">Think back to one of the protests, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, you know, to -- There were protests for equal rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">I participated in those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">And there were protests for -- against the -- the Vietnam war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I did some participation in that, although I was turned -- turned off, because of the -- some of the characteristics of the people who participated in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">There was a lot of anti-Semitism by the Blacks at that time, and I -- there was a lot of Jews, young, you know, Jewish students that were participants, but what bothered me, that they never stood up and objected to the overt anti-Semitism by the quote, leadership of the -- this anti- Vietnam movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">And even if you went -- tried to participate in the Civil Right activities, there was lot of anti- Semitism, so I f-found this dichotomy, I said that, you know, it’s making it difficult for me to participate in one cause, while they’re acting in this manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And there was, of course, lot of drugs going on, which I never, never touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I was single in those days, just to remind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">So anyway, but -- So I sort of pulled back from that, and I put it back of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">I don’t know that I gave it another thought since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1574">QUESTION:  I just wonder, I have heard of anti-Semitism in the Black community that might have effected, for instance, Jewish Civil Rights workers, but I have not heard too much about anti-Semitism in the anti-war movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I just wonder if you could say a little bit more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1576">ANSWER:  It was rampant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">There -- They were accusing, well like now, they are accusing them of spreading AIDS and you know, in through certain times way back in history, they accused them of poisoning <span class="DLF">wells</span> and drinking blood and all that, you know, it’s -- and lot of them -- I don’t know who the leaders of the anti- Vietnam war movement were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">There were many Jewish names, if you think of the -- what is it, <span class="BUILDING">Chicago seven</span> , you know, and all that, there’s a lot of Jewish names, but of course they were not participating -- I mean, they were not practicing Jews, number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">Number two, they were blinded by the purpose of their cause and everything else didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And number three, I guess they were afraid to be it -- if they objected, they were afraid to be accused of not being quote, good rebels or something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">So, and maybe they were even anti-Semitic themselves, in -- there’s self hate in every group and I know there’s enough of that among the Jewish rebellious youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">So, you know, I really don’t know what I can say about that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1583">QUESTION:  A little more on the anti-war movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">What -- How did you reconcile, or was it necessary for you to reconcile your love of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">You mentioned how quickly you became a citizen and the sometime anti-American sentiment that came out in the protests -- I’m thinking, of course, of the burning of the flag and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">Did you have any conflicts about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1587">ANSWER:  Well, you know, like there is a saying, my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right or wrong, but that’s just part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">If wrong, then to correct it and set it in the right direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">So, I had no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">I mean, burning the flag is a extreme act of some -- of desperation, I would guess and even Supreme Court says that that’s acceptable way of protesting which, it goes against my grain, you know, it’s disturbing to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">But I was opposed to the war and I didn’t see a need for it and there’s been wars there forever, 1t was imperial wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">Just a substitution of F-French left, Americans stepped in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">You know, it wa -- continuation of the same and I knew how French had treated their imperial subjects and the Americans just continued the same way, so I -- I wasn’t happy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">But that did not diminish my love for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">If we can correct it’s ways, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">Every now and then, the best of us go in the wrong direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">If always, somebody would put us straight, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">So I had no conflict, as far as that goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1599">QUESTION:  It’s very interesting, because while you describe as a young man, you, as a young man essentially obeying his father’s authority and really doing everything he’s asked to do, but from very early on, when you come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you’re quite comfortable s -- pointing out what is wrong with the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">You referred back to saying, “What about the Negroes,” when you were probably only 14 or 15 years old, and then questioning the Vietnam war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">That’s an interesting outlook, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1602">QUESTION:  Well, there is an explanation for that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">I -- I was always interested in taking -- well, approaching things in an ac -- academic fashion, debating the pros and cons of different issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">But when it came to confrontation and swinging punches, I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">So, in case of my father, he was the authority, the physical strength, if you will, because he had used his superior power, physical power on me in the past, so that’s one <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">When it came to objecting to things the way they were, like I think a first recorded objection, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , was the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">I used the word wi -- <span class="DLF">fence</span> , but it was a <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">We objected to that, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">That didn’t mean that we want to go and have -- fight it out, you know, with the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">And when it came to protesting, I was just one in the sea of protesters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And, as a matter of fact, when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , these protests -- Vietnam war, I was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">Well, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">But when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , they had these <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">This was way back in the early 50’s, and the people would go there, these young protesters would just read poetry and we would drink coffee and well, I guess there was something else going on, maybe drugs or something, but I was not privy to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">I would just go there as a date, you know, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take your date and sip coffee and watch these people try to perform, sing, recite, play the guitar and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">So it was, you know, in the vogue, everybody was doing it, in my circle of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">And then one time, well, when we were there, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> got raided and we were all taken in, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">But it -- you know, it doesn’t change my character, I did not go there to have a -- a you know, showdown, to beat up people or get beat up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">I just went there because it was the thing to do and everybody else did it and I didn’t see any harm in it and whatever else was going on there, that prompted the police to come and arrest everybody in there, well, that’s something that I did not prepare for, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And later on, I would engage people in an academic discussion of different political viewpoints or economic viewpoints or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Again, it was non-physical, just debate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">QUESTION:  Does that mean you have an arrest on your record?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1623">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">They -- They -- You know, they held us there, they asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">It took a few hours to let us go, but, in fact, we were able to -- I was able to return the girl <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before anybody was aware of anything strange happening, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">Her parents did not know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1627">QUESTION:  Were you frightened when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1628">ANSWER:  Terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Like I said, I mean, I was not out there to challenge authority at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a US Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike Danon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">This is tape number five, side B, March fifth, 1999. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">I wanted to ask you, jumping around a bit here now, with your children, have you -- how open have you been about your history, or h-how detailed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">Have you been able to speak openly about your life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> and your time with the partisans in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1635">ANSWER:  Well, here comes another conflict within my psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">First, let me say that the -- the answer to your question is -- it’s no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">I have not spoken freely with --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So you were -- you were beginning to say that -- that the answer to the question is that you haven’t spoken a --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, okay, and the problem is that I never wanted to impose my will or my history or my anything, on anybody, unless they really showed, to my extreme satisfaction that they were interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">So, my kids, I didn’t want to teach them the languages that I knew, I didn’t want to tell them about my history, because this fell in this particular category, when I was saying, when they are ready to hear my story, if they ask me, I’Il tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">Otherwise, Ill just keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1640">QUESTION:  Have they asked you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">ANSWER:  Well, they started asking, the older one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">At one point she sort of said, da -- “How come, Daddy, you never told us about your history and all that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">So I told her, briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">And then, after the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> made that tape, they saw it and they did not know most of it, so I guess one of the usefulness of the tape, was to transmit my story to my children, to that extent that it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1645">QUESTION:  Has it changed, has it gotten any easier to talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">You actually did refer in our interview that, you know, you -- you -- you have sa -- spoken about it now several times within this Virginia community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1647">ANSWER:  Yeah, I don’t think that I have any difficulty speaking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">I c-certainly don’t have any problem in willingness to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">Sometimes, as I talk about certain things, there’s subconscious sensitivity on some points or issues, and I couldn’t even tell you which ones they are, but sometimes I feel that something is happening to my eyes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">So -- But no, there’s no problem, no reluctance on my part, to speak about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1651">QUESTION:  You mentioned, it was right at the end of our interview, this idea that perhaps you had come back -- that you have come back to your faith, and you mentioned a Hebrew word for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">Bal --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Bal Tefulah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">I’m sorry, Bal Teshuah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1654">QUESTION:  Bal Teshuah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1655">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1656">QUESTION:  I -- I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what is that like to be back with your faith now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">You mentioned that you had come back to it, you had explained why you had drifted from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">What does that -- How does that play out in your life now, this sort of reaffirming your f -- Jewish faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1659">ANSWER:  Well, I never really abandoned it, or anything like that, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">What was happening, after the destruction of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , and after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , really, I was at that particular stage in life, age had lot to do with it, another one 1s the surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">I was with the partisans, wearing a red star on my cap, he -- you know, the hat, or whatever it’s called, the military hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And they, as you know, and everybody knows, Communists are the opposite end of religion, you know, they are -- and not only agnostic, but they’re really opposed to any form of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">So I was being at my very vulnerable stage, I was being exposed to the opposite side of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">And I guess I absorbed some of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">But then later, when I was in the -- back in the Jewish surrounding, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , so I accepted, I realized, you know, and there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">I never denied being Jewish or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And later on, when I left my parents house, and I went on my own, I was working out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , but they were sending me to <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> , and <span class="REGION">Arkansas</span> , and <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> <span class="BUILDING">parents house</span> , and I went on my own, I was working out of Columbus, Ohio, but they were sending me to Tennessee, and Arkansas, and Oklahoma, you know, th -- for months at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">Well, maybe not months, four or five weeks at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">And in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the population was 2,000, you know, the nearest big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">I was doing audits of different installations and there wasn’t very much Jewish presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">Well, sometimes I s-searched it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">It was always a little bit of an effort to -- you had to travel 20 - 30 - 40 miles, to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">So, sometimes I guess I got sloppy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">Friday night, it’s customary to go to the Jewish religious services, well the guys are going out carousing or whatever, you know, so there is -- there was this conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">If you can imagine when you were in your 20’s, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">So, that might have been a problem, but when I got married, and I married a girl who -- her father and her <span class="BUILDING">household</span> was non-religious to put it mildly, but yeah, we searched that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , within the first year we joined the one that was near us -- well, not too near, but anyway, and we were active participants and then as our children -- as we got children, and as our older one started attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we started coming more often -- well, regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">And it’s funny, because the rabbi asked for a commitment from congregants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">Any kind of commitment and he says, you know, it was like a -- it wasn’t a fund-raiser, but says, “We’re asking you to commit yourself to something, to tell you that you know who you are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">So I said, “Okay, attendance once a week of the religious services.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">And since then, we would bring our daughter to her <span class="BUILDING">school</span> this -- on Saturday, anyway, we’d stay for the service, and when the other girl was born, then we bring her when she was small, and we attended regularly and I don’t think I missed one, even with the big snows, so we been quite observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">And then, later, when my older daughter became, oh, I guess conscious of her religion and all that, she got her mother to convert the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> into, you know, <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">And I don’t know where we fit on the spectrum of religiosity, but I feel very comfortable in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1683">QUESTION:  And both of your daughters are very ha-ha-have the religion woven into their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">One is a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">Your youngest daughter is working at a day care center that’s within a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">day care center</span> that’s within a synagogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1686">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, that’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">As a matter of fact, the telephone call was about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">My younger daughter, when we goes -- when she was here, we would go Saturday for the services and the -- just to let you know, we have three services every day and Saturday it’s important to have, like in the morning services and noon services, or afternoon, the big -- the central theme of the Jewish religious observance or ritual, 1s reading the Torah, and the Torah is read Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">So, my younger daughter got accustomed to leading the service, the Saturday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">And this was the cantor from our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , says he 1s not going to be here March 13th -- 12th and 13th and he wants to know if he can count on my daughter to come and lead the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">And she did that when she was at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and she has been doing it when she was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">We would go Saturday morning and stay for the Saturday afternoon service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">So she’s quite knowledgeable and it’s not something I taught either one of them, they picked it up on their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1694">QUESTION:  What is the name of your congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1695">ANSWER:  Agoudas Acheim, which means congregation of brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">It’s not a sexist term, brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">Brothers includes sisters, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1698">QUESTION:  And where is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1699">ANSWER:  It’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">It’s near <span class="DLF">Quaker Lane</span> and what is it, 395.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1701">QUESTION:  Have you ever been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , where -- where -- where you were born, since you left, with the partisans, really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1702">ANSWER:  No, I have not been back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">At one point I was considering it seriously, but somehow other things got in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">When I was in the military, during the Korean conflict, they send me to -- first to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">And at several times, like during vacation time, I would go travel around Europe and I never went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , because it was still under the Communist rule and I didn’t know what kind of foolish things they might do, like oh my papers might show that I was born there and they might retain me or something and that wouldn’t f-fit too well with my military requirement to be on the post, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">We -- Anyway, no, that was one fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And one time, I went to a religious retreat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , which is not too far from Yugoslavian border -- Yugoslav border, and I’m -- I was toying with the idea, going across, well, I had a few days free time, so I figure, maybe I rather spend them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and was some -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and those <span class="REGION">areas</span> <span class="DLF">Yugoslavian border</span> -- <span class="DLF">Yugoslav border</span> , and I’m -- I was toying with the idea, going across, well, I had a few days free time, so I figure, maybe I rather spend them in Munich and was some -- Salzburg and those areas, than take a chance going across. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And I didn’t know what kind of <span class="DLF">roads</span> they had and I read about lots of accidents, traffic accidents and we were, well, limited time, so I didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">But, all my o -- both of my younger sisters went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">The younger one went in 1957, the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">That’s when she was earning enough money on her own to have her own kind of vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">She went, visited my older sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">And she enjoyed her stay and the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> seemed even prettier than it was in her mind, in her imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">And the middle sister, Sarah, she went right before the war, this present conflict, like 1990 - ‘91, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">She and her husband, and they toured the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and she retained quite a few good memories of her visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">But I never went back, even though my brother-in-law keeps bugging me, keeps asking me to come there, and visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1717">QUESTION:  What have been your thoughts as the present conflict in -- in a very horrific period o- of war in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> have -- have played out over the past few years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1718">ANSWER:  Well, I knew what was happening in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and anybody who was interested, could have read a little bit about what the -- the basis of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the influences from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and I can be as specific as you want me to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">But I’m not too proud of the staff in our state department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">If -- If you want me -- okay --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Te-Tell us some, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1721">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1722">QUESTION:  I am very -- This is an interesting point, and I would like to know what you think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">ANSWER:  Okay, well, first of all, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was created from all these different, southern Slavs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro- Hungary empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were brought up differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">They had different religions, different scripts and different history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">So they were not the same kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came from the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls and agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Divide and conquer, it’s a old expression and it’s -- it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">So <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and the Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so there was -- the conflict was being raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">They were supported -- <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> was supported by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , of course, because that’s the big brother, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and was supported also by <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">So there was that inner conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Now, what we call <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> today, actually it’s <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Herzegovina</span> -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">Anyway, these were just two little <span class="REGION">provinces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">As far as I know, they never had a political autonomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro- Hungarian empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro- Hungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">Anyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the outside powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the supreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian authority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">And that was in everybody’s mind after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">So Tito, when he became the leader of the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">And whatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">And he was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">He allowed anything that worked for him, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free ownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">But anyway, I knew when he would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn’t build a natural succe-succession force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">He did provide the mechanism, but no way to enforce it, because the control of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was with the secret police and the army and he didn’t have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians declared themselves independent, first 1t was <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> , and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">And they were not successful, because they had to cross <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and it was not the most effective way of conducting a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">So <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> succeeded in seceding from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">Then when <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and they -- they took over the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I want to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government, under this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">He’s -- I guess he’s a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of taking, let’s say <span class="REGION">territory</span> , they would just go there and destroy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">Like, that was their way of discouraging, but not a very civilized way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">But anyway, the Croatians were not very civilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that’s all evil, it’s all around and which one is the worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">But unfortunately for my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were there, we were in a position to pacify that <span class="REGION">area</span> , we didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">In fact, whatever we did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker’s rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">Jim Baker, he was George Bush’s Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was acting in that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">So, I didn’t like what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761"><span class="COUNTRY">Libya</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> were sending arms to Bosnians, to the <span class="REGION">Moslem side</span> and of course, they had no way to get the arms through, except through American controlled areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">So we just let them and the Croatians would take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">And that encouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">And I think we picked the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> in that conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">We could have pacified it, we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">And that’s my viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1767">QUESTION:  Pll just ask one more question, and this is about your eldest sister Blanca, and her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">How did she fare in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">What kind of life did she lead, un-under this Communist regime?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1770">ANSWER:  Okay, the kind of life that my sister had under the Communist regime was not pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Number one, when they were -- she uses the term demobilized, after the end of the struggle, she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">Of course, everything that we ow -- had owned, was taken, but she was able to find out where some of the furnishings were, like the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> set and the dining room and the, you know, just the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the, you know, just the furniture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">And she tried to recover that and they were giving her a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">The government was not very friendly toward the Jewish returnees, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">People who had been either in the armed services, or who had escape and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">Either -- Well, I don’t know if anybody who listens to this, whether they remember what happened when the Jews tried to come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they would be attacked and many would die and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">So, the anti-Semitism was rampant, just as much after the war as it was during the war, except now it was not under the approval of the state, but just -- the state would sort of turn away, or wink, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">So, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">She used to tell us how she had different problems trying to reclaim this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">And then finally, she went to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and very unsympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">No, it was very uns-unsympathetic government and when she did get it, it had the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> had degenerated to a point that it wasn’t worth anything, so it was dumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">And she didn’t have any means of support. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">She lived with her uncle, who was a barber and she -- there was an aunt that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span> , went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">She lived with them also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And they were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">The life was difficult for everybody after the war, but especially for her and she was by herself, there was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">And we suggested several times that she should try to come and we could try -- work on it, but either we were not energetic enough or she was not enthusiastic enough, so nothing was ever done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">Then she met a young man and she wanted to marry him and we were opposed to that, because of religious differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">And I -- They married anyway and then life improved for them as -- well, she was still studying, and life improved as he started making a more comfortable living.</span></p>
