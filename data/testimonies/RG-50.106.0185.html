ANSWER:  I was very precocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was a snot nosed kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But I was bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In fact it’s kind of interesting because when I was six years old somebody took me to some Zionist meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was sort of a commemoration of somebody who was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Joseph Trumpeldor who died, da, da, da and here is this little six year old and she says well what’s so great about dying for your https://collections.ushmm.org October 14, 2010 <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Isn’t it more important to live for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I thought that was a pretty astute comment from a six year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  How did the teacher answer that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  It wasn’t a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was a youth group. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Very, they were quite impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">As I say I was a kind of a bright snot nosed kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I don’t think I was quite as smart as I thought I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But I was fairly bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Which has stood me in good stead over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">In fact I guess growing up when I did I grew up sort of confrontational and I think it stood me well all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I like to say I’ve never been aggressive but I’ve always been assertive. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Fine distinction but a good one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  What’s the distinction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  That when you are aggressive you hold things, you have boundaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It’s not all free floating. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">As aggression can fly in every direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Assertiveness is focused. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">At least to me that was the distinction.</span></p>
