<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  It’s July 31, and my name is Kevin Wayne, with the United States Holocaust Museum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I am here with Walter Lachman, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> survivor of the Holocaust and we are going to interview him and discuss some of his experiences during World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And we can start very basically with some demographic information, your name and if your name was different at the time, to mention that as well as your date of birth and place of birth
ANSWER:  I was born Wolfgang, I guess after Mozart, Louis Lachman on May 26, 1928 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father was Max Lachman who was born in the year 1900, also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">He was the son of Louis Lachman and Anna Lachman and by profession was an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> and become an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother was Frieda Schwartz whose father was Gustav Schwartz and Recha Schwartz was her mother and was also born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they were the proprietors of a wholesale handkerchief and kerchief business. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My grandfather served in the first World War as a master sergeant and served in various theaters of war -- most notably in the French campaigns in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father joined the German army in 1918 just before the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">While he never saw service in the first world war, he was very active in what was the campaign by the German army against the Spartacus uprising -- this was an uprising led by Karl Lebclech of basically communist agitators and it was put down in 1919, Lebclech was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father fought in that ... against these Spartacus revolutionaries and received the Iron Cross, second class for his efforts. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father married in probably 19... ?’</span><span class="sentence" id="12">m not sure, probably 1926 or 1925 uh... for various reasons, personal and to himself, he chose not to pursue his engineering career any further and entered my grandfather’s business to work along with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What kind of engineering was he involved with before that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  He was a mechanical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My grandfather’s business was apparently a very thriving .. uh .. <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">After I was born in 1928, I remember being there and seeing lots of things being shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Big boxes and big <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> -- as it turned out, when I was first born, we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that the business was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The business was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> and we lived on -- 1t was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I guess on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> above that. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Afterwards we moved to what was presumably a better <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the western section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> which 1s now -- what was until recently, the American or the Western zone of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The business had originally been what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Um -- I had always led a very sheltered, quite comfortable childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Generally, we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we also had a fairly small, little <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuenhagen</span> -- it’s really like a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and we used to go there for weekends when we weren’t away. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">As a general rule, my parents uh .. my mother and my father and my grandmother, went on a vacation every summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father stayed with us for the first week -- we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">Marin Bada Kalspark</span> ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">sticks in my mind or Cantina in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and my father stayed with us for the first week and at the end of the summer he came and picked us up, so he spent a week with us sort of at either end of the vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I don’t know how important it is to this whole narrative, but it will tell you something about my background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was an only child, from I was told later, I was born by Caesarean section and in those days, women chose not to have any more children if they had one by Caesarean section. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I .. at least that is what I was told, I don’t know how factual that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh.. I like to get to my schooling now. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- I believe in 1933 -- it was just about the time that Hitler came to power and I started going to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> -- I remember having to sing the German anthem of course, every morning before <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And also the National Socialist anthem and soon after that, there was a time when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> agitated for the return of the <span class="REGION">Saar provinces</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we had to sing a special song for the return of the Saar -- the coal producing -- the steel producing area that had been annexed by <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- demilitarized rather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  So you sang these three songs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Sang three songs, and I must say that the first two or three years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> really proceeding relatively uneventfully -- I can’t recall that there was any particular prejudice or any particular hatred or any particular problems that I experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Did you also attend <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Not when I was that small. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">As far as religion is concerned -- we were members of an orthodox congregation that at some point in time during my younger years, my father chose for whatever reason -- my father and mother -- I suppose it was a joint decision -- chose to join a reform movement and we went to a large -- very elegant <span class="BUILDING">reform synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Maybe that had something to do with our move to the <span class="REGION">Western part</span> , I really don’t know how that came about but whatever -- that is what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Prior to that move, had you been living with your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I skipped that. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My grandfather had died probably six months after I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He died of tuberculosis and I do not remember him at all other than from pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  This was your mother’s father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That was my mother’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And neither do I remember my father’s father, who had apparently had died before I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I do remember my father’s mother and I do remember my mother’s mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My father’s mother lived near us but we never spent as much time with her as we spent with my mother’s mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I don’t know why that is but I suppose that 1s sort of par for the course, it happens everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And uh .. my mother’s mother really did go along on all vacations with us -- and sort of -- while she did not live with us -- she lived in her own <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- we saw her much more frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Every Friday night we went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for Friday night dinner which for some traditional reason was not chicken but rather was roast beef -- or whatever -- roast beef and roast potatoes or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I am not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Oh, I would like to talk briefly about my first memories of the Hitler rise to power and socialism and what I overheard in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . -- </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Um... the first, the first real memory that I have of a discussing about Hitler was -- or about National Socialists -- was one night when we were visiting my uncle -- this was my mother’s brother -- who also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- who also had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- but by the way, they did not live too far away from where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichstag</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We saw the <span class="DLF">sky</span> turning red and over the radio we heard that there was a fire in the <span class="BUILDING">Reichstag</span> and at the time, I remember a conversation that my parents had with my uncle about that particular event and about how they thought that 1t probably was a staged event and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think now that if there is a political equivalent in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now you would probably say that he was very much a conservative republican and he felt that this ... first of all, I think ... basically I suspect, that while he never said so, he probably felt some sympathy for some of the things that Hitler stood for. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always ... I remember one of the things that he always used to say was, “Well, this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews, particularly the Jews that had served <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the war and so on and so forth, or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesn’t believe in all that nonsense and if it doesn’t work out, we will leave on the “last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ’”.” </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Whatever that “last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ” meant, we never caught it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We didn’t make that last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I am trying to think back now, I am trying to be a little bit ... go more a little bit in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Probably about ’35 or °36, things started changing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Jewish children could no longer attend the regular <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and I had to go to what was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in the backyard of a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in a fairly old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the older part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And it was necessary for me to either take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> ---- to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator train</span> , or walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And, I still remember some of my teachers and uh -- that was not .. I think the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh .. I think I missed some of my friends from the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> but I got used to it very quickly and that’s when I started, in addition to having regular schooling, I started to have religious instruction also. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Peculiarly enough, even so that we belonged then to a reformed <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the religious instruction that I received was Conservative Judaism -- the reform synagogue did not have any <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Uh .. I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a couple of years and then, you know, I was probably seven, eight years, nine years old and while one is not ... really does not .. is not too politically cognizant of what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I did hear a lot of conversation about Jewish doctors being no longer allowed to treat non- Jewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longer being allowed to practice cases, other restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Also, my father complaining that some of his gentile customers no longer would buy from him or were afraid to buy from him and uh ... there was a general deterioration in the quality of life ... not the quality of life so much but the economic aspects of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As far as I can recall, the quality of our life really continued pretty much as it had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We continued to take our summer vacations, we continued to go to our <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neunehagen</span> , my parents continued to go to concerts and to the opera and when I reached this age, they took me once in a while and all those things were opened up to us and we continued to have a ... I believe an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> and I believe there came a time when we could no longer drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> because Jews could no longer drive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pleasure vehicles</span> , and my father had to sell it and was pretty disgruntled about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But meanwhile, he kept saying, “Well this will go away and this will blow over and this is just temporary” and his business was still fairly good so he wasn’t complaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So things pretty much continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Did he take over that business? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Was it pretty much ...
ANSWER:  Yes, he was really running the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Since my grandfather died, he was really running the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Maybe this was really ... for all I know, he might have gone in the business because my grandfather was sick or was dying or something like that ... that there would be continuity for the business -- that might have very well been the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Um ... when I left <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , which was probably around 1937 or 1938, I don’t remember exactly anymore, we had to go to a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- what was known as an <span class="BUILDING">upper school</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> kind of thing -- but it was not called a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> because there were not supposed to be <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was called Jude Schule Nacht Liebplan und UberSchule -- UberSchule meaning an <span class="BUILDING">upper school</span> kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And that was in the Western part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I really believe that this is when I had my first, first personal contact with prejudice because for some reason or other, there were a lot of young kids, non-Jewish young kids who would wait for us in order to harass us and beat us up on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there was just really almost no escaping it and every day it was a challenge to try and devise a way to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> a little different -- different <span class="DLF">street</span> , different side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> or get off at a different elevator stop -- to try to avoid that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And very often we were successful, very often we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Most of the time, I had to go alone because where I lived there was no other kid that was going to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it became a daily challenge and I really remember being afraid every day to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and crying to my mother that I don’t want to go and I’m afraid and this and that and the other thing and my parents said you have to go, you have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I really don’t know why my parents didn’t accompany me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I suppose you can’t do that every day anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But somehow, I made <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I mean, nobody really got hurt seriously, we would just get knocked around a little bit -- but I was afraid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was never really strong or a very athletic child. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">In fact my parents tried to encourage that aspect in me and had me join the Maccabean soccer league and I had boxing lessons and stuff like that which I was never really good at. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was just as bad at my piano lessons, I was never any good at that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In any event, that became a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Then came the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938, and at that time, my father’s business was all smeared up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with “<span class="BUILDING">Jewish Store</span> ” kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Even so, it wasn’t really a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- it was a wholesale business -- people couldn’t really go in and buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was painted with big letters and people were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and discouraging customers from going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Many of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned down -- in fact, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that was a turning point in the general prosecution er .. persecution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It really, from then on, everybody’s life sort of became miserable who was still left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Was your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> vandalized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not vandalized -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There was no problem with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Uh..
QUESTION:  Did your father go to work and open the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  My father, yeah, my father went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I think he probably closed for a day or two but he still had one or two non-Jewish employees who stayed really with him until the end and in fact, I had been corresponding with one of them soon after the war and I sent him some food packages when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> after the war but ... Llost track of him and of course he has to have been dead for many years now. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And uh ... my whole life started to change after November 9". </span><span class="sentence" id="110">First of all, that summer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the <span class="DLF">Hartz Mountains</span> which are <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in <span class="REGION">lower Saxony</span> and my mother became ill, while we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I guess it was some sort of bleeding if one sort or another and she died soon the after of Leukemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  The summer before Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  That was the summer of 1939, so it was really a sort of double whammy that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">First my mother dying and then Kristallnacht was that November. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My father -- soon after, my father became ill or at least did not feel well. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I think that a lot of it had to do with -- probably a lot of it had to do with my mother’s dying -- it had to do with the deterioration of the business -- the general hopelessness if the situation and he still kept saying “This won’t last -- this won’t last.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But then he started, I believe, trying to get us out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But after 1939, it was really quite difficult -- the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> would not take uh .. Jewish refugees at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">For the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you had to have a relative who guaranteed your financial support. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We knew nobody here so that was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My father made some tentative tries to get to a <span class="REGION">South American country</span> and I will tell you more about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I think he made some contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> and I think some work was done along those <span class="DLF">lines</span> , hoping to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Was your father ever taken for forced labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He was never in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , he was never in any forced labor -- he was never really hurt in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh... my father, I remember living of course with my father and we still had a maid, or a servant in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That was a problem too, I believe that sooner or later, we weren’t allowed any more to have a non-Jewish servant living in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> so I think she became a day person who would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My father became ill and died on December 19, 1940 of tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Tuberculosis was then, still a very dread disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Today of course, it has been eradicated -- or maybe it’s coming to the fore again -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But in any event, people would die of tuberculosis and people would talk of tuberculosis like we talk of cancer today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Do you recall him being ill in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes, I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I recall visiting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Of course, you couldn’t go to the regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> -- he went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and died in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">After my father had died, my grandmother liquidated their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I moved in with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That’s my mother’s mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My father’s mother had died in between somewhere -- somewhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> - probably I would say 1935 or 1936, somewhere along that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But as I said earlier, we weren’t really that close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So from 1940, after December 1940, I moved in with my grandmother and moved in with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I remember my Bar Mitzvah -- which was a very small affair -- but I did have a Bar Mitzvah -- and I guess because of my grandmother, it was in an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But it was a very small thing in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> afterwards with some people coming over. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Nobody could have big festivities any more -- you couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> any more and you couldn’t go to concerts any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My grandmother wasn’t involved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all that stuff after my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh.. I continued with my schooling while I live with my grandmother and we received a notice in January 1942 to report for resettlement on let’s say on about the 20" of that month. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I can’t be sure of the correct date, but around the 20" or 21° of January 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We reported to a very large -- one of the few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that had been left standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  That’s where you were told to report?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  That’s where we were told to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">One of the few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that had been left standing and they cleared out all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and everybody was on blankets -- sitting on blankets on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and slept there for a day or two while we were being registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We were allowed to bring, I think one suitcase each and uh .. I remember my grandmother had me put on double clothing -- two pairs of pants and two shirts and things like that and she took a hundred mark note and wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around it so it would look like some extra sewing material and gave me that to keep in my pocket which turned out to make no sense at all but you know, those are things that people do when they don’t know where they are going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Did you pack something special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No, my grandmother did the packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Incidentally -- while I was living with my grandmother, she was pursuing this uh ... this Chilean trip or immigration and nothing ultimately came of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I remember even taking lessons because uh .. to learn how to make marzipan so that she would be able to have something that you can make a living in if she came to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I would help her do that somehow, it never came out too well when I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We practiced cooking marzipan in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so that we would have something professional or a trade if we ever got to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> but obviously, nothing ever came of it so as we received our notice in 1942, we registered and there were probably about a thousand people and they would -- as I read now, -- they would .. each of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would be about a thousand people would be put .. would be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Q; How did this notification come to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  It came in the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Just in the mail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  It came in the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My grandmother, amazingly enough, did an inventory of all our household goods that we had to leave and I still have the inventory so I am trying to collect from the German government for that but who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Whatever- whether anything will come of that or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Maybe nothing ever will. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It’s amazing to see all these things -- she was very meticulous, I mean even to the extent of phonograph records as to how many were left behind and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  How much leave time did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  We had about ... I would say it was about a week, ten days. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That’s really all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we couldn’t take very much so you didn’t need much lead time -- I believe the suitcase could weigh no more than 30 kgs which is about 60 pounds -- it is less than we usually take on a vacation trip now -- so you really couldn’t take very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It turns out later on that we lost everything anyway so it doesn’t make a difference -- the whole thing was academic. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Um ... my last memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> uh .. were that, as we were leaving the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , my ... the principal of my ... of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that I had gone to was standing at the exit point and gave each person a hard candy and he said goodbye to me and I was surprised that he remembered me and then we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and the last sight that I remember of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is that victory column that site in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">Tiergarten</span> , it’s just a monument -- nothing really special -- I believe it remembers- it commemorates a victory in the war of 1870-71 against the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Um... we were brought to a <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> and uh ... in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> -- you know, in regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> ... and they were locked and we started our journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Many of the people, I remember, were fairly old -- I was the only child in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- the only youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I must have been about fourteen -- about thirteen and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was soon after my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">My Bar Mitzvah had been in May 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And uh .. there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> for toilet needs which were emptied from time to time -- the journey took, I believe, about seven or eight days. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was getting colder, the food was relatively inadequate -- this was 1n the middle of winter -- this was in January and we were headed East so obviously <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> have no heating facilities -- but there were enough of us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so there was a certain amount of human warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  You were with your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  I was still with my grandmother and incidentally, while we were at the gathering point of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I remember seeing my first person dying -- which is really sort of indelible in my mind -- I saw many, many more after that but there was a man on one of those blankets near us and all of a sudden, he started -- well, I guess he had a heart attack and just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I mean, nobody did anything to him -- he just died and that sort of stuck in my mind -- I had never seen that before and it was sort of a frightening thing to a thirteen and a half year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Q For your mother and father when they passed away, was it still possible to have a normal funeral service? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">A Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">There was a normal .. you know there is a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and one of the peculiarities of the German Jewish community was there was one very large <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which catered to all the different religious -- religious Jewish denominations so it is a very gigantic <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- it’s still in existence -- I have been back there two or three times and it is a very lovely, peaceful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And there is a very large family plot that accommodates both my mother and my father, my grandfather, my mother’s brother, who died also of asthma probably somewhere in the 30’s -- that plot is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">O.K. -- how are we doing with the tape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  We're O.K.
ANSWER:  O.K., we are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> -- or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> or whatever you want to call that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">A number of people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> died, but after you see your first person dying, you sort of become immune to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Did you pass those bodies out at certain points or ...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They left them. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They left them until we got to where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">As it turned out, we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , which was then the capitol of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and uh .. we ... aS we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> -- it was very cold, and there was a great deal of snow which was higher than I had ever seen it and we were told to put our luggage on sleds which were waiting nearby -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleds</span> -- I think they had horses -- and we put the luggage on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleds</span> and I guess that was the last we saw of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Where they took it, we’ll never know -- but it was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We were then put on other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and were driven to what had been the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> -- I mean I know all this, but of course we didn’t realize this when we went there but I knew that subsequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Apparently, from what I know now, that had been the section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that had been a closed ghetto for the Latvian Jews who in December of 1941, had all been taken to the surrounding <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and killed and uh ... we went into those <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and uh ... and were told to make yourself at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- you decide where you want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Of course, there was very little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- generally about three or four people, sometimes five people to each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> being included as a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga 377</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">was an enclosed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  It was a closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , not an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">You know apparently in those days, from what I know now, there were open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where people could come and go as they wished and there were closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where there were <span class="DLF">fences</span> around them and you had to pass a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you could only go out in order to work and that was for a specific work purpose -- you could not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> had been -- had always been a closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  So they brought you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they said “Find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  They brought us to ... they would count out a hundred people and say “Here 1s a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , this is it -- go to it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And it was amazing, in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , there was still food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , of course everything was cold -- there were no in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">apartment toilets</span> -- it had been a very poor part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> on each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> but because it had been left unattended for month or six weeks, all the toilet facilities were frozen and that became a real problem I remember during the first few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Because, as you know, nothing unfreezes, it never gets above freezing -- so it was really a ... that was one of our little problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh ... we sort of ... we didn’t know what to do for the first few days, nobody really paid any attention to us -- they would give us food, they brought it around in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> -- in <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span> and what have you, but ... I would say that probably for the beginning, the food was fairly adequate, there was enough of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  So you would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to ...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to get the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Was there some type of Jewish council?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  There was nothing at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">All these things formed as we stayed there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">First of all, the biggest trauma that I experienced probably in my entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> life, was during the first two weeks of it and during the last three months of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So let me go into the first two weeks of it so that I can tell you best as to what I recall best about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">As I said, I was with my grandmother who was in those days, probably in her early sixties and uh ... if I remember correctly, fairly old looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It really fits the image -- she had gray hair and she was a little lady, maybe a little on the heavy side, not too ... but maybe a little on the heavy side. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We were together in a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with two other people, with a single woman and a single man. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I don’t remember exactly how we slept -- all I remember is that nobody really had any purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I mean, everything was aimless, we just would -- I would -- you know being a thirteen and a half year old kid, I was kind of curious and I would walk around and scavenge around and look for things and try to get into <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that were not -- that were not occupied which of course you weren’t supposed to do, but I really hadn’t quite gotten used to the idea of imprisonment yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Uh .. I would say that about the fourth or fifth day that we were there, when we went out to get our meal, they asked us for volunteers to help to sort clothes ad I said to my grandmother, “I think I’d like to go” and she said, no, don’t go and I said “‘yeah, I want to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I have nothing to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So I did, and I remember that they brought us into a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and we had to sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Apparently those were the clothes of the Latvian Jews which we of course didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And we had to put sweaters with sweaters and pants with pants -- stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I mean, something that a thirteen and a half year old could easily do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Were there other children there, that you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">By that .. you know, the last few years, the only time I really saw children was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I mean, there was no way that you could play with other children, you know that ... and I really would spend more time with adults than I would spend with children anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So uh...
QUESTION:  How long did the sorting go on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Oh, that was just a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was just a day’s job, it wasn’t a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And you know, when I made my way back, to this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where we were living but my grandmother wasn’t there and uh ... I asked for her but nobody knew where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And then it turned out that a number of the older people had been taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And apparently the first, I know now ... but as far as I was concerned, she had just disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But we know now that the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> first experimented with those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> whereby they would direct the exhaust into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and uh .. while they were driving the people would suffocate and then they would just unload them and ... you know, go for the next load. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Of course, later on, that turned out to be a very tedious and slow process and they couldn’t handle very many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They could only take like twenty or thirty people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and there wasn’t really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they subsequently abandoned that method and used the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower rooms</span> and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So uh.. the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely difficult time for me because I had always been a sheltered kid, had always been with adults, had always been with my family and uh .. it was really very traumatic- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to ... it was a mixture of feeling lonely and feeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. I wasn’t really as much worried about my life as I was just at a loss about what happens now? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Where do I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Who is going to take care of me? </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the realization that I would have to take care of myself or I wouldn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I continued living in that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with these two single people for a ... for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I remember sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> while they shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly enough that people would think about those kind of things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but I guess, love is a pretty powerful influence, it comes right after food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Was this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> heated at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Yes, there was heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was heat and there was, really I must say, there was heat and from what I can recollect, there was really adequate food. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We were not starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">There was never really like a whole lot but there was enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Twice a day you would get food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yeah, twice a day we would get food and I continued working sorting the clothes- I continued doing that and uh .. we worked no more than eight hours so it was a relatively normal workday. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Most of the work that I did was done in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but I know that there were other groups that assembled -- there was a large square in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- that assembled, and they were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to do work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  As a young boy, what was your impression of the S.S. or the guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Well, you know, one of the overriding and important thoughts that you have is that you worry about nothing other than keeping yourself alive and you go from day to day and that impulse intensifies, becomes more important. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You hide from those that you feel can hurt you, you are anxious not to share anything that you have with those that are with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There are stories now about many friendships having formed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I have never experienced that and as far as I am concerned, I was very selfish and very self- contained. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work a little less or get a little extra food, I was very anxious to preserve that for myself and not tell anybody else about it and so, if anything, that mentality was probably one of the ugliest aspects of our imprisonment because we became totally oblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody who was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the feelings that would come to your mind first was boy, am I glad it’s not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And rather than feeling sorry for the first that this was being done to, and I think this was one of the, one of the dehumanizing and ugliest aspects of the whole ... of that whole situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So, let me go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Do you recall the couple’s names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  I recall their last names. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It happened to be Levy in both instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He was Hermann Levy I believe but I don’t know what her name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I mean .. there were .. again, we were .. we really lived along side each other not with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We didn’t share anything and we talked but it wasn’t ... 1t was just like strangers talking at a <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> , that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We really lived, just happened to be in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">After ... the ghetto life sort of normalized itself if you can speak of such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">There was a council of elders that had been formed and there was a <span class="BUILDING">ghetto hospital</span> and there was even, would you believe, a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> -- that was not a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , per se but there were services being held in somebody’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and uh .. whenever I could, I started going to services -- which were not well attended incidentally -- uh .. from what I understand, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> performed abortions because children were not allowed to be born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Some woman : Excuse me, were there mostly Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Yes, at that point there were mostly Germans and a few Latvian Jews and some Czechoslovakian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">In fact, we lived in <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> .. the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I lived in was a <span class="BUILDING">Berlin building</span> and then there was a <span class="BUILDING">Hamburg building</span> and so on and so forth and there was a group from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">One of the ladies who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> became the secretary to one of the elders -- the Jewish elders -- Alteste Rat as it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And through her, I became .. I got a job as a messenger for the Alteste Rat, of course there was no phone so when messages had to be brought from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, somebody had to carry them and she arranged for me to have that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And uh .. I did that for probably, I would say a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Then that summer, it petered out and I went back to sorting clothes and uh .. subsequently, I had gotten a little bit stronger and quite a bit leaner -- I had been a fat kid and I lost most of that -- so one of the guards noticed me and I was sent to a ... I went on a fairly extended trip, cutting lumber in what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the Germans call it Pleskau, P-L-E-S- K-A-U, the Russian name today is Pskov P-s-k-o-v. And we were probably there for a.. oh, I would say a week or two weeks or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  You were transported out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ..
ANSWER:  Transported out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , cutting down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , which I had never done before -- but that was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We .. we lived in abandoned <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We also -- I was also put on -- they call Commando -- to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzekne</span> and while I was there, I was ... I came in contact with Boleslav Michovsky who has become fairly well known in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because he was the carpenter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minneola</span> that was accused of the war crimes -- as a war criminal and then I guess he lost -- was stripped of his citizenship and was supposed to be deported and he is now on trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for his crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Probably now he 1s in his eighties so he will probably never ... never make it but in any event, that .. that became a fairly celebrated case. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">End of Side A. Start again at 000 on Side B.
ANSWER:  O.K.
QUESTION:  What did you do on that commando?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  I think we also did lumber, we also did wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Did everyone survive those commandos?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Yeah, you know I haven’t really spoken much about guards about suffering per se because, there really, in all fairness to the Germans, we didn’t have much contact with the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">There were very few S.S. men or guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I mean we were just sort of like in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam cooker</span> -- we were left to cook by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There were obviously people -- guards at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> uh ... I don’t remember any specific acts of cruelty or harassment in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There were at work, if we didn’t work fast enough, they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or something like that but it really wasn’t the real gruesome things that you hear about --those really all came later and in the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Uh... I am going to try to put this in a proper time frame now. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> probably from the beginning of February 1942 until uh ... late in 1943 or maybe even the beginning of ’44 and uh .. no, no, it wasn’t that long -- excuse me, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was from the beginning of ’42 until probably early ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Then the Germans were beginning to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and were moving people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Uh.. I would say it was somewhere in °43, early ’43, maybe middle of ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It seems to me that it was either spring or summer, that the spring and summer in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> are very short and don’t last long. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Uh ... we were brought from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> , and from there, where we really stayed a relatively short time, and then were brought to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> that specialized in receiving, sorting, cleaning and rehabilitating uniforms for the German army from the front -- 1t was called <span class="BUILDING">ABA 701</span> -- ABA standing for Armee Bekleidung Amt ( Mr. Lachman spells these words out ) Amt being bureau. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And there we had much more contact with the guards and there was a great deal more harassment and a great deal more supervision and of course that was beginning to be real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> like where instead of, this was a big old <span class="BUILDING">factory building</span> -- 1t was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that had manufactured blue color, blue dye and everything in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was still blue -- I remember that like it was yesterday -- it was called <span class="BUILDING">Riga Ultramarine</span> , they had made artificial, I guess, artificial blue color.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  What was your job there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Sorting. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Just sorting and I was .. I was somehow ... I stayed with that sorting stuff, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Maybe I became a specialist -- I don’t know (laughs). </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But there we were constantly supervised by the S.S. people and constantly harassed and constantly kicked and constantly you know ... annoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And uh... we Slept in the typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> arrangement where there were like ... they weren’t <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> ... they were like big <span class="DLF">platforms</span> , one on top of the other, three high or four high. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Everybody would lie in the ... on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and it was so crowded that you know, you couldn’t really turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You had to lie on your side and of course, men were separated from women in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">communal baths</span> and it was really like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Incidentally, let me go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Uh .. from time to time, people would try to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and as they were caught they would be brought back and hanged and everybody would have to march by in the morning and they would generally leave hanging there for, especially in the winter time when everything froze, sometimes four or six weeks just sort of as a memento so that everybody could see it every day and I guess that was supposed to discourage us from running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I must tell you that I really never had any thoughts about running away or anything like that because I couldn’t envision myself ... I had a difficult time enough getting along -- I had no contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I didn’t speak Latvian -- I only spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I mean there was just no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Also our hair was cropped close and through the middle we had a shaven strip that was re-shaven probably every two or three weeks so ... and the women were completely shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Their heads were completely shaven so you would stand out from the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I don’t know how people ... I guess some people did get away -- you know, not many but I guess some people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I mean there are many recorded instances known of people who actually ran away from .. especially from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and joining partisans or undergrounds or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I don’t know that there was much of an underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> because the Latvians really, from everything we could see, were really very much pro German and very much anti Russian and I think the Latvians were probably rooting for the Germans to win and uh .. I would say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the Lithuanians-- were probably more, more antagonistic towards us than many of the Germans were so I couldn’t envision escaping into that element. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh ... let me go back to where I was -- to the living conditions in that ABA 701.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  A quick question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  -- You were obviously growing this whole time, were you able to find new clothing for yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Through your sorting were you able to pull through any ...
ANSWER:  Well, you couldn’t ... well, I'll tell you -- I did that once and it wasn’t such a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Uh ... it turned out to be a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Uh... well, you know, we had uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We had those blue and white striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Incidentally, for one reason or another, amazingly enough, I still have my uniform cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I still have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The original uniform cap.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  That was once you were in this ABA --
ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you wore civilian clothes and I don’t know how I made out. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I really don’t .. you know, it was so long ago, some of that stuff just, just doesn’t stick out. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Um.. while I was in that ABA 701, I stole a pair of shoes because my shoes were just completely gone and uh .. I muddied them up a little bit, you know the outsides so that they would look old. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But of course, you couldn’t disguise that and I was found out and uh .. I was called to the commander and first got a good beating and then he said, “Well, I guess we will have to execute you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So, I went back and I said well, I guess this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But somewhere later on, one of the guards came back and said “ Well, he’s changed his mind, all you have to do ..”, he gave me an iron bar to carry and I had to carry it, you know there was a <span class="BUILDING">four floor building</span> , I had to carry that bar up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> for I don’t know how many times .. fifty times, maybe a hundred times -- I don’t know what it was, but that was my punishment and of course I got a pair of wooden shoes which was the worst punishment because I had to wear those for the next couple of years and it was really hard to walk on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But..
QUESTION:  Where did you find those shoes that you took?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  I took them from the ones, all the things that came in, the things that I was sorting. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Uh .. before long, there wasn’t really a whole lot of sorting to do, so instead of sorting clothes they switched us to loading and unloading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , that came into the <span class="DLF">Riga harbor</span> and uh .. that was a lousy job because first of all, it was cold and it was wet and we then worked twelve hour shifts -- you either worked the night shift or the day shift and there was really no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide -- you were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- and the worst of it all was that the Russians used to come and bomb the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> all the time and we had really no protection -- all you could do was try to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as quickly as you could and you know they had these flares that they would drop and the <span class="DLF">sky</span> would be lit up and they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine gun ships</span> and they ... in those days, the Russians we were really beginning to make substantial progress and were moving against the Germans -- pretty well down into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span> or just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ships</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Cargo ships</span> -- no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We were loading and unloading ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We were loading and unloading supplies -- if we were loading supplies, sometimes we would try to steal some of the food if we could and again, anybody that got caught really got into serious problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Uh .. I remember taking a package once of something and under great personal peril and when I unpacked it, I found out it was mustard -- that just goes to show you that you never know about all those things -- so instead of food, I got mustard. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Um ..I was very angry at that time because I had taken a tremendous chance to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It seems silly now but I didn’t laugh then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Your food rations at that point had decreased?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  The food rations at that point had deteriorated and uh .. things were really getting tougher every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But as long as we could work and I guess we were a pretty good working group, they would keep us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were concerned because especially the ones that were older than I could see that the tide of the war was turning against the Germans and uh .. they were -- they would say, well, gee, what are they going to do with us if they have to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">---I would like to take a minute or two and talk about some of the older people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because, you know, I had uh .. I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I was 14 or 15, 16, whatever age I was at that time, I never had the opportunity to acquire any personal dignity if you know what that means -- in other words, I never had a real position in life where I had self respect, where people looked up to me, where people felt this is a great guy or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, probably on the whole, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and concentration life was easier for me than for some of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I remember one of the people that worked with us in that ABA 701, had been the chief gynecologist in one of the leading <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Now you know, I can just imagine what scrounging for food -- the loss of dignity, being kicked around, being cursed at -- I sort of took that in stride. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I had grown up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I had been cursed at on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so you kind of become accustomed to it -- you don’t like it -- but you figure out that’s the way life is. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But I wonder how life was for those people and it must have been much more difficult than it was for me and uh .. well, I didn’t have any particular empathy for him at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Now I can think back, I feel that that must have been a degradation to him a great deal worse than it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Uh.. O.K. -- so much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So, let’s get back to the end of the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">By that time, as I said, the Russians were raiding us almost every night -- by raiding “us” -- raiding the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And of course the Russians didn’t know we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">In fact, towards the end, the Germans were parking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> -- there was a <span class="DLF">train track</span> right through that ABA 701- that old <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that we were at, and the Germans were parking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that were loaded with ammunition right along side us, so we didn’t care -- it didn’t make any difference but they obviously did that on purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Uh .. for one reason or another, the Germans decided to keep us instead of shooting us which was really, really was amazing because in retrospect, I know many people were not as fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The Germans withdrew all their forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> to a uh .. toa bridgehead in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> -- German name, the Latvian name that it goes by now is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liepaja</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It is a <span class="DLF">port</span> that is not on the Gulf of Riga but is on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Baltic Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">It is also in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It is really not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And they brought us there and that was a smaller group. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They took some of the people that had worked on that ABA 701 and brought them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthoff</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> which 1s also a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And they took probably 80 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And again, I don’t know why .. how I was selected to be part of it -- I wasn’t a better worker than anybody else -- I wasn’t a particularly strong or healthy individual -- I was probably as emaciated as everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I think a lot of it was God’s providence and luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So I was amongst these eighty people that were brought to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liepaja</span> and we were housed in I guess it had been an old <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> -- it was near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , on a beautiful <span class="DLF">street</span> -- but there was barbed wire around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">We were loading and unloading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> -- mostly at that point, we were not unloading anything more -- we were loading. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The Germans were trying to carry back everything that they could carry back. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I remember, we were dismantling even the <span class="DLF">tin roofs</span> -- putting the sheets of tin in wooden <span class="INT_SPACE">enclosures</span> and they were being shipped back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They were just stripping the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we were there for ... that must have been late ’44, that must have been, I would say, early Fall to late Fall ’44, and we were there for several months doing that particular thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One of the unfortunate things that happened there was that one of the Russian bombs hit the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we were in and probably fifteen or so of us were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Uh .. which was really too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Uh .. again, you don’t feel -- I did not feel, particularly sorry for them, I felt particularly glad that 1t wasn’t me. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And, that is one thing that I won’t forgive the Germans for -- is that dehumanization of people -- of this complete destruction of the human spirit and of the human compassion and you know, that was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was hard to come back and maybe you didn’t come back all the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I don’t know, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Maybe, I will never be as compassionate of a person as you, I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But in any event, we were there for a while and again, those of us ... the older people tend to be more concerned with the future -- the people of my age really were worried with day to day. “</span><span class="sentence" id="385">How am I going to have food today? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">How can I work the least today? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">How can I get the best night’s sleep? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">How can I ...?” </span><span class="sentence" id="389">That was about it. “</span><span class="sentence" id="390">How can I keep my behind clear so that nobody kicks me around?” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And again, people were worried about what will they do with us when this is over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And again, it was perhaps divine providence or perhaps luck or whatever, they decided to take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">As they were evacuating the bridgehead in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> , they put us on a.. a .. in the hold of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of freight, by that time we were down to about fifty or sixty people, and brought us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  How long was that journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  I would say three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I remember that there was no food on that trip and that was kind of gruesome but at least we were getting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I think probably they didn’t want to leave us or didn’t want to leave our bodies for the Russians to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I think really that was probably the rationale because I can’t think of any other reason why they would take us back, because by that time, they didn’t need us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">By that time, they had no more use for our labor because that was early °45 and you know .. the thing had completely disintegrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">It was either December °44 or January °45, I don’t know which but it was probably December "44, by that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was in such disarray that there was no work to be done anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">As I said, the last time .. while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> towards the end, we were dismantling <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and shipping them back which was really one of those nonsense jobs kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">There was no reason for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">What were they going to do with sheets of metal? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You know, there was no need for it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Uh... I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> coming in ... of course we were 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> , we couldn’t see anything and uh ... when they let us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , I remember terrible devastation in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean we hadn’t been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ... this was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was so destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Uh ... and, I really think they didn’t know what to do with us when they got us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It was the kind of thing where somebody says, “what did you bring us here, where did you get these guys? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">What am I supposed to do with them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">That kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So uh... for want of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they put all of us in two <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Which was awful crowded and uh .. we had just nothing to do for probably .. they kept us there for I would say three or four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We got very inadequate food, they did take us out a few times and the only thing we did when they took us out -- we were collecting shell fragments from the anti-aircraft guns that had fallen -- you know they were really jagged fragments. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I don’t know if you have ever seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they are jagged pieces of metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">You have to be careful when you pick them up because they are really sharp in some instances and we put them on, in Europe they use these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer trucks</span> that are open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> in the back but we no longer had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> because they didn’t have any gasoline so we had to pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But again .. this was a nonsense job -- it was really not a job that meant anything because nothing was going anywhere -- nothing was functioning anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">You know .. <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for all practical purposes, really had stopped functioning in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Uh... I suppose, somewhere in the middle or towards the end of January, uh .. maybe the director of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> wanted to get rid of us and said “ look, take these guys away, I don’t want them here” or somebody said, ““What do we do with these people?” </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So, they put us in two small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  How long were you in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  I would say about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Maybe three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">You know, you lose track of time and uh .. even if I did remember, I don’t remember anymore now. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Uh... when we went to -- they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , they gave us anew number. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">My old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> number -- which incidentally I was never tattooed, I don’t know why, maybe they weren’t doing it that day that I got my number or something but the old number had been 12360 and I was then given the number 15713. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Um... we got a new number, we got put in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and uh .. we got locked in and that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We just didn’t hear or see from anybody any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was just like a .. you were left to your own devices. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We got some food but we got very little water uh .. I remember there were these <span class="DLF">pools</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which were supposed to be water pools that were used .. that were supposed to be used if there was a fire uh .. they were supposed to pump water out of those <span class="DLF">pools</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire truck</span> and we would drink that water. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Later on, we found dead bodies in those <span class="DLF">pools</span> -- there was ... you know -- 1t was just a nightmare and people were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I contracted typhus -- I had terrible diarrhea, I mean just every day, you would drag yourself outside of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and sit out there all day long, leaning up against something and when it got dark, you drag yourself back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was no more roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">You know, during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> -- every morning there was roll call and all that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">People would come to make sure that nobody escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I mean order, total order had broken down, it was just a question of .. the only question that was in our minds, ‘How can we survive this? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">How can we keep this up? </span><span class="sentence" id="439">How can we stay well enough until this is over?” </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And you know, every day, hundreds of people were dying -- dozens of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We would try to at least, we couldn’t bury them - we weren’t strong enough for that -- we would drag them towards a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would all be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I mean there was no brutality by guards -- there were no guards -- there was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They just put you in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they would once in a while give us some food -- some watery soup that was sort of shoved through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and anybody that was strong enough to get to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> could get some but a lot of people couldn’t even get up and um .. would just die where they lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Um ... I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> probably for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">On the day that I now know was April 15, 1945, we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> with stars on them coming through the barbed wire and uh .. that was the British army and uh .. the German guards were either -- the ones that hadn’t melted away, I imagine a lot of them had run away -- were taken prisoner and the British came in and I guess they were pretty horrified by what they saw because they just couldn’t cope with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You know, this was an advancing army, they don’t -- how could they have medical facilities for uh .. I believe the records indicate that there were 13,000 unburied dead were found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 23,000 unburied dead were found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 13,000 were to die from the time that the British took over until they were finally able to bring sanitation and what have you into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Uh .. the British couldn’t really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks -- they did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldn’t eat -- but at least we got water. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">There was no medical attention because how could you have enough doctors to take care of all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And again, it was probably fate or divine providence that I got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And a number of us got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We were then ... the British decided to burn .. oh, the British used the German guard to bury all the unburied dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We saw that and it was sort of satisfaction to us, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Uh .. they burned down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they thought that all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had been so polluted and so full of excrement and blood and whatever -- there was just no way to preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> , in fact, when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> -- it is again a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">You know .. they were two story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , it was a parade ground and typical kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And we were in there and that’s when I would say -- I probably had a recuperation period of three to four months -- we got medical care. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We got adequate ... we certainly got food. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We were treated like human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And it’s amazing how fast you snap back and start thinking in terms of enjoying your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I had missed really all my childhood -- really missed all my teenage years. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Those were the days when I first -- when I all of a sudden became interested in girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You know after I got better and I guess the girls became interested in boys and we would talk and you know .. there would be the normal umm ... social ... intercourse between people where you would spend time together and enjoy each other’s company. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Uh... one of the people who worked for the British Red Cross, a lady -- I spoke some English because I had taken English in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but more than passable. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">She came into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> one day and said is there anyone here who speaks English and I said yeah, I speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So she needed, she was running a supply uh .. <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> .. the British call it a Supply Dump but it’s really not a <span class="DLF">dump</span> , it’s a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It was organized by the British Red Cross and order of St. John and I became an interpreter for her and later became attached to the British army as an interpreter and that’s why I am wearing the uniform in these pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And amazingly enough, I kept in touch with this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">She just passed away probably a year ago or two years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We would exchange Christmas gifts and letters and phone calls and she came to visit us once and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And uh .. I worked for this British Supply D ump as an interpreter and those were wonderful days -- it was like .. well .. like being let out of a cage. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You know, it was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We could get the normal haircuts and we could wear normal clothes, we could talk to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We felt that we were equal to -- well, you know, after things like that, you really don’t feel that you are equal to anybody and you feel always in intimidation of people in uniform or the sense of awe of that and probably to some extent, I have never lost that entirely. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Uh .. the respect for authority 1f you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">If somebody tells you that you are not supposed to do it, you just don’t do it or else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  How long did you work with the British?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  I worked for the British probably until late 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Late .. excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I’ve got my dates all wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Late ’45, I’m sorry, late ’45, maybe early ’46. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Uh... then, I started really thinking seriously about what are you going to do with yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Where do you go from here? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Uh .. most of the people that were with me at the time, the young people -- almost everybody who survived was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There were no old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I would say everybody was between 15 and 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">There was nobody older that made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Most of the young people wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Uh .. I felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was an agriculture society which was what it was and that was not what I wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Uh... I wanted to go somewhere else -- I wasn’t sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">For some crazy reason, I ... my father’s sister and her husband had gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before the war and for some crazy reason I remember their address. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I don’t know how I ever possibly did that but I did do it, O.K. And I wrote them a letter and made contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, I had an opportunity to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- some other people who did not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and you know, and we pretty much, except for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , could decide where we wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We could stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , some of the people who had been from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> had wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Not many of them, but some did. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So...
QUESTION:  Did you think of returning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I wanted to have no part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , wanted to have no part of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I wanted to go somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  Some woman: Your uncle was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  My uncle was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  woman: He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  That was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I knew I had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but I just did not want to go ... I just didn’t want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I don’t know why .. yes, I do know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I didn’t want to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I didn’t want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I wanted to work in some kind of a trade or business enterprise or that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Uh ... so .. uh, I decided that if I wanted to go .. I finally decided that I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and in order to do that, I had to really get into what was then the American Zone of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It was very difficult to get from the British zone of occupation to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, this Mrs. Payton wrote a recommendation for me to the <span class="BUILDING">United Nations Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and also a friend of mine who was a Canadian captain who I also met after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And uh .. I had to get permission to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- you know, everything was still in disarray. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and started working for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> --, the United Nations Legal and Rehabilitation Administration doing the same thing again in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for relief supplies and I applied for going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and came here in September 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I had the relatives -- my father’s sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I had some other relatives who lived in <span class="REGION">Springfield Illinois</span> and we were given, before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we were given ten dollars as money for -- we came on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tube ships</span> the “S.S. Marlin” -- I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I remember having our first oranges aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and orange juice. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I never had orange juice before in my life and you know, just to see oranges in bins -- you know ... I hadn’t seen those in ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I hadn’t seen eggs in ten years -- well, not ten years but five anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, you know, this was an amazing sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It is hard for anyone to imagine that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And uh .. since I had seven dollars left out of the ten dollars, when I came here, and that was not enough to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , so I chose to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Which was that train fare here and that’s basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  You landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I did not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , inside or <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I had some relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I guess it was the sister of my grandmother or something like that and I stayed with her for a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">First of all, it was very difficult to find a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because that was the time when all the GI’s were being demobilized and of course, they had first right -- as well they should -- for all the jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And uh .. I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> and I guess I hung around for about two or three weeks doing nothing and just enjoying this wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and all the opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in either a wholesale or a <span class="BUILDING">retail business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> had kind of a small main <span class="DLF">street</span> and I went from one end to the other trying to find a job in one of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and I did not find one. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Later that night, somebody called my aunt who I stayed with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> and said, “well, there’s a person who has a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in an outlying section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> who is looking for a stock boy”. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I found a job there as a stock boy- then you know, my problem was schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I never had more than eight years of schooling, so uh, what I need to do was first to get my school equivalency certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Which, I don’t know if you have that here but in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , you go to the department of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They devise a plan for you -- evening courses that you have to take, correspondence courses that the State Department of Education gives and I, they devised a plan for me whereby I would get the high school equivalency certificate which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Meanwhile I continued working during the day, in that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I then ended up at <span class="BUILDING">Northeastern University</span> at night, there was a Springfield division of <span class="BUILDING">Northeastern University</span> -- it was a high school equivalency certificate and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Northeastern</span> for six years -- always continuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales person. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Then I started going for my Masters to <span class="BUILDING">American International College</span> -- another <span class="BUILDING">local college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I never got my Masters -- I hope to take some courses now and maybe get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I ultimately advanced to buyer and then general manager and then subsequently the business was sold to a large corporation and I became president then became president for some other <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> -- so, I at the height of my career, I ran eleven small New England Department stores for the Van Heusen shirt corporation and in 1982, I had an opportunity to buy the original <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that I had started working at as a stock boy, which I did and I just sold it in March of 1992 and I am retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">That’s basically it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I talked for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">If you still have ...
QUESTION:  Sure -- there’s plenty of tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Not about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I had wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> to see what it was like and I was really ... I didn’t do it with an easy heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I wasn’t sure really what I would find, but I thought it would be a very lonesome <span class="NPIP">place</span> with maybe just a few old guys like myself standing there and saying Kaddish -- that’s a Jewish prayer for the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I don’t know if you’re Jewish -- if you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So, uh... instead we got there on a Sunday morning -- it had been turned into a <span class="DLF">memorial park</span> and I was really amazed to see probably two hundred young Germans -- some with children going there and just looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Visiting this <span class="DLF">memorial park</span> , you have all the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> that are still there which say “Here lie five thousand’, “Here lie five hundred”. “</span><span class="sentence" id="549">Here lie a thousand”. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But these people had taken their Sundays to go and look at this and it made me feel that was kind of a nice thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That at least these people wanted to know about this period of history. </span>
