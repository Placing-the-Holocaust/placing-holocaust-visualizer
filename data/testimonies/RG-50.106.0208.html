<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  I think there were, there were two different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It’s hard to recollect what I thought but the first is the combat part, seeing, hiding from shells ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Digging in <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Seeing the wounded and seeing prisoners coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">That was the nice part, seeing releasing prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was a totally different thing cause we had no idea what, cause even though <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> had been released, we didn’t get the news of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We didn’t really know much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It had been in the Stars and Stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Eisenhower had very gallantly I thought forced the local people to fill in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And even though it was, I’m not sure the dates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , early April I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We didn’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Stars and Stripes didn’t get to us and they eventually of course did. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">https://collections.ushmm.org June 11, 2013 But so we had the one thing was the whole combat part and the second was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So the few of us that were lucky to get — and not lucky, were fortunate I guess to get in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We counted these awful 36 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail cars</span> and we were then taken down, toured them and there were I think 20 some <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , each originally for 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Each one had about 2000 in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They have still they kept one there as a souvenir and smashed the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when they knew we were close, the French particularly led a -- well what would have been a mutiny, headed by a French captain who later became a general and a friend of mine, he just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He was the — General Dapeche, head of the, at that point he was a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And what they decided to have a kind of a mutiny, kill their guards, but then turn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And keep these distraught prisoners from killing every German in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So they did manage to do this, but at the end -- the German guards were all the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They were called kapos and these were German criminals who were told that in order to avoid <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or execution they would have to be guards at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And they were really horrible people. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And so at the end, we saw lots of their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We didn’t know where they had been killed by our troops who were just there the day before or whether they had been probably killed by the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Anyway by the time we were there, we were led down and saw the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> where it had been decided to go ahead and, by the Polish prisoners doing it, were ordered to keep on using it because they had to do something with all the bodies from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And then the others who had died.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  I think if you think of some of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I mean many I talked to later and became close friends with, they were men who were originally say 200 pounds were down to about 80 pounds and they were just skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Our first instinct was to hand out food and candy and we were told not to because their bodies couldn’t take it and as soon as our officers got in there, we were told to get out because they didn’t want us to get typhus.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Political —
ANSWER:  Yeah political ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And then the really enormous increase came after the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And that was the worst horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They had about 4000 Russian prisoners and they still celebrate it or celebrated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And they were all told at one point to race down in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And if they got down to the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> , they would be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And they were all shot in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But when we got there the mélange of people, it was a little hard to make out. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But mostly were Eastern European. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And the ones in better shape though were the French, because most of the French had been in the French resistance and when we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , what they tried to do was to turn over their respective <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And many of them got caught doing it by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They were too eager. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So they were then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But because of that, they had only been there nine months compared to the longer periods of most of the others, and particularly the Eastern Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And they were the ones that had sort of organized this sort of mutiny to turn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  What were the reactions of the other young men in your — https://collections.ushmm.org June 11, 2013
ANSWER:  Well I think we all had the same reaction pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">The curious thing, there were really very few from the 20" armored. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Just as we were invited into what they called combat command. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And combat command B which we were in, only had our — we were the only artillery part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There was a very small part of our division and that was just by a fluke because the division was headed south and three quarters of it were after the SS and going straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So it just happened that we were on the right flank. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And then at the same time, after we had used our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> to open up the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and all, then you had the, both the 42™ and 45" division that came in, in strong numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And that became a kind of a hassle later on because there were two colonels, one from each division that each thought that they got there first. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then Marguerite Higgins who was the first correspondent who came from the Tribune, and she rode in and I think it was the 45" and they claimed to be the first there. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And so did the 42". </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We got very little credit for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">When I went back in 1940, 95, for the 50", there were only three of us from the 20" armored who sort of hooked on. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">My great, close Princeton roommate that I went back with who had been in the same outfit who has since died, he and I and one other guy that turned up, piggy backed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The 42" division really ran the reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There was a German American who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> who did all of the work so we found out about it and hooked on to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So we got in to all of that, that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But they were still arguing about who got there first and who did what. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But I was able then, because I knew the ambassador and the counsel general, to get them to agree. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">They had no problem with this, that there would be a plaque for the 20" armored as well as the other two that already had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And that took a while to get through and eventually we put the big plaque up and I actually sort of inaugurated it when I went back in 2010, right at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> where it says Arbeit Frei, the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So that was all a sort of an ancillary part of this but —

QUESTION:  What are your feelings when you walk inside the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Well I’ve done it I guess a number of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Probably not as, five or six times, maybe not more. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Incidentally one of the people that I had met at the first time, 1t was, had been locked up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="670">I don’t know if they’Il ever use it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But he was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And then one of the times I went after. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Not only did I get a letter to him, from them but — and I went to one of these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and picked up some medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Whenever, at one time we had a ceremony and I handed him a couple of American medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Made him happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">He has since died. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I was on the phone with him a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But then to go back into some of the people I’ve kept up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I don’t know how much time you want to talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But it was basically when I went back in 95 that I heard some of the stories of the extraordinary stories of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with AlanLukens. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">This is track number two and you were talking about how you have kept up with many of the people.

particularly met and one I’ve been in very close touch with ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">A Frenchman named Joaquin Cote was among a group of French resistance youths in a <span

about this and informed the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They came up all drunk in the middle of the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They killed all but five people, burned the chateau. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Five people played dead but they were arrested the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">One of them was Joaquin Cote. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They were sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">A horrible

id="698">I met him in 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And because of that became great friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I went back in the 2000s, in 2005 and in 2009 I guess it was or somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Suzy and I went over to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he had died, but the son has been a very close friend ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They stayed with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and we went over there, went to several services, made speeches and laid wreaths and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">https://collections.ushmm.org June 11, 2013 We’re going to see him this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He and his wife are close

from another friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> being hauled as prisoners on their way to <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="717">They got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> to go down the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , open it up and pull this one <span

QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  Well it’s, 1t took me a long time to get very enthusiastic about Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Maybe it was a little bit my father that was in both wars and felt the same way pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But and I learned a little bit of German here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And then but one interesting thing I hadn’t mentioned but I will quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">At that first one in 95, I sat next to a German general at a big dinner the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He was the head of the medical department. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And that was quite a dinner that I did get into or some of us did. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Anyway he asked if I would talk to his medical students men and women, about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I said yes, of course I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So I by that time, the next day or something we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> for a little thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And a day or two later a German colonel that made the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which still struck me as odd, took me out and had lunch at the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> with about 25 officers and they brought up, that was kind of bizarre. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They found a kid of my age, then age, 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">A private in the German army, kind of made him sit there to see what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That was a little bizarre. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">But they were all very nice and they were all, some had been also in NATO fans. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">We had given a big award to this German general, his medical thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So at the lunch he invited me to go into this <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> where there were about a hundred medical students, boys and girls in their 20s I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And he said that they had almost all spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Well I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I spoke in English obviously and fairly slowly and I told them all about my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And got a standing ovation at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I don’t know how much they got out of it but it was fascinating to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">On the way back from this last time on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lufthansa</span> , I sat next to a German general of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And he was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">After all, as you’ve said you get used to the fact that they are our allies and that and I made a point in my speech everywhere for and there that, particularly that we were all, this would never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And that it’s there somewhere, anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We’re all allies and that we would all together believe in the slogan of never again. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And I complimented him on the https://collections.ushmm.org June 11, 2013 fact that at all of these events, they brought in all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span> and college kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I’d say most of the crowd there in 2010 were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Well maybe half German and half survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It was hard to tell, a couple of thousand people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But now they have a wonderful ladies, German ladies that run the new <span class="BUILDING">welcome center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And they were the ones that I dealt with beforehand and got on the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And they were very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">It was funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Ahead of time, that the initial rivalry between the three divisions would make it odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I represented all American troops unless I get a clearance from the other divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I knew the guys in each one. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I called up and said look I’m going to be back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I just speaking for the 20". </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I happen to be -- all of us who were there in 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Do you mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Oh no, no that’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">You can represent us. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They were -- track them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">One from each division somewhere in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And but it’s funny that the German organizers were afraid that somehow this would come up, that if I spoke — anyway we cleared all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">But so I think enough time has gone by so that anybody that was there at all and still living -- cause an awful lot have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But I certainly got into this because at the end I became president of the retirees of the 20" armored division. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I did that for about five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I organized several of our reunions and the biggest one was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> , just before this, actually the same year, 2010. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And that’s — they had one more we didn’t get to and now they’re going to — they wanted to go back and have a final one at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Hamilton</span> Kentucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I’m not sure I want to go back there.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yeah and I gave a special talk that year about going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And there was a funny reaction to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">The people who hadn’t seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> didn’t seem to care about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I mean it was weird because that was only a very —

ANSWER:  They had never seen it and weren’t particularly shocked by it until they — so I didn’t make a big point but I told them what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It was kind of curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">But and I didn’t, I criticized the other people, maybe as a contrast that I had such a fascinating career afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">To some of them, this was not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> but the fact of being in the 20", and in the war was probably the — I don’t mean to sound disparaging but the biggest thing in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They went back to their small <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they lived and brought up and that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">That wasn’t true of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">There was one guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tucson</span> when we had our thing there, that he had done a lot of speaking and he had — he just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">He was a very good man and we went, at our reunion there. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">He rallied around and found all of the survivors and a number of Holocaust who were Jewish refugees and people so that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So it didn’t apply to everybody but I would say to some that it was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was not, except for those of us who saw it, was not the main —

<p><span class="sentence" id="888">QUESTION:  Do you read a lot about that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And those <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Not as much as I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I’m just getting Atkinson’s new book on the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I don’t do as much reading as we should.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">QUESTION:  Did you read on it? </span><span class="sentence" id="895">https://collections.ushmm.org June 11, 2013

<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Although it’s funny because the, it was so far back and then I had all my foreign service career and this and that and it was really toward the end of that, when I had time to go to these reunions and work on them and go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , that it brought it back much more than the intervening years when we were traveling in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> and the kids were so young and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Well thank you, I’ve enjoyed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I guess that covers things pretty well.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Wonderful, wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  You asked one funny question about the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Well it’s interesting because the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> here, I came back at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They had one of their young attaches that was supposed to sort of take care of this kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And follow up on -- it was a little odd, but I went over and spoke there once at the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> to the young officers about what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">That was a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  What was their reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  Well they were interested, they asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I was a little bit cynical or skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think that they were trying to be on the right side of everything by bringing it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I was happy to do it but it’s, I thought it was a little kind of an unusual event. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Well thank you very much.</span></p>
