<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you please state your name and your <span class="NPIP">birth place</span> for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Henry Kellerman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I'm a Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I'm a no longer a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I gave up my German citizenship when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I'll always be a Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">You can't shake that. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1910 under the great reign of Casmir Wilhelm, II. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We were a middle class family, and we went to all the stages and points of interest of a upper middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father was a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which put us in the category of, I suppose, really local intellegents here. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My mother came from AustraliA: My father was a Bavarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So, if we ever wanted to talk about a mixed marriage, that will be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was far more a philosopher than a theologian. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was a student and became a collaborator of Herman Korne, and was a member of the so called <span class="BUILDING">Marbrook School</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He wrote extensively a number of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The last one he couldn't finish because he died prematurely at the age of 53 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We were in those days a typically Russian middle class family with all the necessary qualifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were brought up in the German classics. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I remember my mother at the age of 86 could still quote , and all that she learned in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My father was totally devoted to German philosophy and on one the side and to the Jewish prophets on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">His sermons I remember were always on a fairly high intellectual level, and as a child I understood very little of it and later I wondered how many else really grasped the meaning of the message he had to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He had enormous power of intellect and overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where we were educated according to the very strict rules of German humanism. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We learned enormously facts and figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We learned five languages, starting of course with German, French, English, Greek, Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">You name it, and naturally integral and French calculus. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was a very profound type of education, but it taught us very little about social values. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Social criticism particularly in history was not permissible and we grew up without any defense-- intellectual defense at the time against the powers that were to take over later on in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I went for twelve years to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and graduated in 1928. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I then went to various <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fribrook</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , and eventually made my doctorate degree at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> , doctorate of Juris Prudence. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The years I spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , as a child and as an adolescent were years which really laid the foundation for whatever later on became my professional calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They were great years in many respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The 20s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , an unforgettable experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I remember that the summary referred to that the 20s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as a so called age of pericles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">What was offered in terms of art, culture, and literature was unbelievable, and the names I got to know in this days on the German stage and the German consulates, unforgettable, and I didn't forget them. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Later on, I was fortunate enough to meet some of these prominent actors and when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I believe that this is something that is frequently overlooked, that in the 20s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> really seemed to be the cultural capital of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">With four <span class="BUILDING">operas</span> , 36 legitimate stages, two great symphony orchestras, a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> with high standards of excellence, and with a scientific community which included Albert Einstein among others. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was paramount to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">What came afterwards in the 30s was a total collapse of all what we had seen, heard and learned in the 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I lived four years under Hitler, and I experienced on the first of April, 1933, the day, I lived continued to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I continued to stay for a number of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">First of all I wasn't finished with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was my hope, which proved to be a total illusion, as it was with many other Germans and Jews, that that was a passing phase, and if we had the patience and the will to stay, we would see the end of the Hitler regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">That proved to be totally untrue. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My second reason was that I had always been a member of the Jewish Youth Movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I had been in a leading position there, and when Hitler came and all the young people were thrown out of their German Youth Organizations --
QUESTION:  Which German Youth Organizations were you a member of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  I will come to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We all banded together in one large organization which was called at the time the League of German Jewish Youth, and I became the National head of this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">By our standards, which were not too large, but there was 10,000 plus with local chapters all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which I visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We operated under increasing restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">There were prohibitions all along the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We couldn't meet there, we couldn't meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The Gestapo people came to the private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where we had our weekly or monthly sessions, and watched us kids discuss Jewish history and religion and took assiduously notes to the terror of the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But we were rather not phased by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We put up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Then the restrictions became more acute and we had to limit our meetings and eventually the league was dissolved by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Before that, we created a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a little more than that, a settlement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silizea</span> (ph) where we were training members of our organization for amunication as farmers, as artisans, in other words, in non intellectual pursuits which we felt at that the time might open a new future for these youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I stayed until 1937 and my third reason for staying was I still working on my doctorate dissertation at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It became more and more precarious and the question, would I be able to make it to the final exam was very questionable. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I had a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Berlin University</span> who went to battle for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">After the Nuremberg laws were passed in 1935, he called me in and he said, you know it's very doubtful that you still will be able to pass your exam, but I trust that if there is any passions left in this administration, they may remember that they admitted you before and they will feel legally and duty bound to admit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And he proved to be right. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was indeed permitted over the protest of the Dean of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and probably some political authorities to take my doctorate exam in 1937 at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> , and I passed it, and a month later I left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">A few years ago, I remembered that 50 years had passed since my first doctorate examination and it occurred to me that I should find out whether the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> would grant me my so called Golden Doctorate diploma which comes 50 years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But I was not willing really, to be honored that way by a <span class="BUILDING">University</span> that was still under communist control, and I delayed my application until the war came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">After this, I went to my friend in the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> and I said do you think it's practical for me to request that I be granted my
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can you give us some specific cases that you worked on and some of the people that you worked with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, we tried for one thing, Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS and my boss, and I worked together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and we tried to break down the testimony of Herman Goering, who was the prima dona of the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was enormously difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Goering was a man of extreme intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We gave him ani.</span><span class="sentence" id="69">Q: | test, all the defendants, and Goering and , a former minister of finance and potentially for the war effort emerged in the genius category. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There came the day when we presented the structure and the pogrom of the party to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">A young mayor, not so young, a mayor whose name shall not be mentioned, was given the task of presenting the evidence against Goering and the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The mayor was a man who had studied the record, but it hadn't sunk in, so I had to coach him for the job, and I presented him with a chart of the party, and he said when you introduce the party tomorrow will you please point out that Goering was the number one deputy of Hitler, and that Hess was number two and then follow up with the rest of hierarchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He couldn't grasp it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I would say now repeat after me, Goering number one, Hess number two. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he would say all right, if the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> please the head deputy was Mr. Hess and Goering was number two. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It went on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He couldn't get it straight until at midnight I thought he had it right. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, the next morning we assembled in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> and the mayor stepped forward and said, if the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> please, I will introduce now the charter, and as shown on this chart here of the party, we said number one deputy was Mr. Hess, number two was Goering. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You should have seen Goering. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He got light in the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He shook his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He waived pieces of paper and I said we have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I sent a piece of paper up to the good mayor and said Major would you please correct yourself and ask the person on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> to listen to you, you made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He stopped and looked down and he said oh, if the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> will permit me, number one deputy was Goering. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You should have seen Goering. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was pleased as pie, and that was only a few weeks before he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But if he went down, he went down with flying colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Another thing which I remember which was important I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">At one point, when we showed the film, the <span class="BUILDING">death mills</span> , which is documentary we found showing some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and showing some of the scenes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we darkened the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> and had only lights shining on the faces of the 22 defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I had opportunity to study the faces while that film was shown and all that brutality and it was amazing how they fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Goering never looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Neither did Hess. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Schott who maintained all through the trial that he had nothing to do with the atrocities, turned his back to the screen and crossed his arms in front of him to indicate that he had been an absentee during the Nazi period. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Franz, the butcher of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> broke into tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So, did Salkin, who was the labor czar. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The only person who looked at the screen with obvious glee and pleasure was Streicher who was the so called gall leader in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Franconia</span> , and who had been the editor and publisher of this filthy rag the Stormer, Storm Trooper you might call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">This was his show. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He felt that he was vindicated completely by that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He also was the one, he was sentenced to death who allegedly, I wasn't there, shortly before his execution said to the executioner now you have your poem after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He knew his Jewish calendar obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Now, those are scenes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I do remember many others that may be worth quoting, but the trial itself was conducted by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> which was divided in four parts, two American judges, two Soviet judges, two French judges and two Russian judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were not in agreement all of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That was obvious, but still the proceedings were conducted with utter dignity and decorum and I'll never forget the opening statement of the presiding judge, Judge Lawrence from <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> that this was a trial to be conducted without fear or favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We had a galaxy of lawyers, SS prosecutors, as well as defendants and judges of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The judgment was to many disappointing although some of them the guilty one including the military, top military were sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I carried away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> the conviction that I had attended an event that would go down in history as one of the probably most remarkable demonstrations of international justice, and I still feel that same way about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Although I will admit that the major purposes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to protect peace and to ban genocide and anti-semitism have not yet been met and probably will not for some time to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Can we digress for a second and go back to your role as to exactly you did for preparation of this trial and who you interacted with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Well, I interrogated quite a few of the defendants and also as I mentioned before wrote these pretrial briefs in which I packed all the evidence we had at the time on the felonies of the party leaders, the so called leadership core, the SS, the SA also many of these things came to light after the trial including the one document as I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I was chief of research. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That was my title in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I had a staff of a dozen people, most of them members of the Office of Strategic Services, including such upstanding lawyers as John Herz, who was part of it, and was a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , later. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we just collected the evidence and some of the evidence that came to us in the most peculiar ways I remember that one day a reporter from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> times, came in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said I understand you're responsible here for collection of evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I went to the Chancellory, Hitler's Chancellory which was a heap of rubble of course in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I looked around and there were a lot of papers and I picked some up. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I don't read German. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I have no idea what I picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I'd like you to take a look at it, and he handed me a piece of paper that was slightly torn and singed of course, but low and behold there was the order from the SA party judge for the so called crystal night to the SA: You know it was long denied that that was any organized effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was always as the used to call it, the boiling soul of the people who did it, but far from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There was the order, black and white for the SA to get busy and set the torch in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> of Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Can you tell us whose interviews you participated in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Well, one I remember quite distinctly was who was the head of the <span class="DLF">labor farm</span> and he was a sad sap by the time they got to him, he was obviously ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">His eyes were tearing, his nose was flooding liberally, and I presented him with the chart of the party and said now you were the leader of the organization, tell me whether this is correct the way we put it together, and Lyle looked at it and he said well yes it is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It is correct, but that doesn't in any way reflect the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">This was a dynamic organization and you cannot put it into boxes straight <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">vertical lines</span> and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He then began to take my fountain pen to draw weird circles within circles and said this is the dynamism, unless you catch it you can't catch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Two days later he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He obviously had committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That was one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Then there was a real red neck I got this SS leader from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , a fellow by the name of , and I confronted him with some of the atrocities that were committed by the SS in <span class="REGION">southern Russia</span> and he looked at it and looked at it and said I don't understand how can you people know these things, you must have a terrific staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I don't know whether he tried to find out in order to get a favorable consideration or not, but he was one of the worst butchers. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And then the other one, I will remember and never forget was a fellow by the name of . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He was -- he referred to himself as the butcher of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He was an SS man, and he said I want to be confronted with some of the generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We got him together with General , the tank general and a general by the name of . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He said to us, I know what we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but he said, but I'll be darned if I take the blame all by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We generals here we are just as guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They participated, they had the regular army and they worked with us in some of the ammunition of the minorities in <span class="REGION">southern RussiA</span> : absolutely denied it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I have never known, but I don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">went to the collapse, and I have it black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It's in the archives, and said in German ; have we tried in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I don't think the children in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> knew much was going on in the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> although they may have heard rumors to the effect, but was sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He didn't stay very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He was liberated, was put back again, and died eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, those are some of the vignettes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There were many more. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I could go on forever telling you stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I would like to perhaps finish by saying this. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The punishment of the guilty was of course one of the post war targets and I had the satisfaction of being part of that, but I always felt that this was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I remembered the days of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimer</span> , where a fledgling democracy was trying to come to the fore, and found very little sympathy outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The unbelievable reparation which were astronomical and which were never paid as a result of it, prevented not only the flourishing of the democracy but increased of course the strengths of the reactionary forces which eventually gave birth to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The Weimer republic not a very experienced democracy and not very strong, collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And my feeling, the feeling of some of our friends was that this must not happen a second time, and that after World War II as against World War I we would have a duty to encourage and force the democratic elements in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if anyone could be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They could be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We found people like Audenaur. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We found people like the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , , and many, many others whom I got to meet after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And we decided that in order to help them, we not only had to sanitize <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> economically, it
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can I ask you your comparison between the trial that you participated in and the subsequent trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Well, the subsequent trials really fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">If you want to see the documents as I read Telford Taylor's book and I was invited to go back as deputy to Telford Taylor for the second trial and I didn't do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was so advised in fact by my old boss Bill Donovan of , and it turned out that some of the trials were good and some of it is documented among other things in this marvelous picture I've seen three or four times, Judgment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , with Spencer Tracy and Lancaster which more or less gave you the flavor and philosophy of what really was I suppose the purpose of these trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But in many cases they just collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">In some cases, the Germans proved to be tougher than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">For instance, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> acquitted Schott, which I thought was a major mistake at the time, but the Germans put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So, there were some trials that worked out right, but on the whole what came afterwards ended very often in acquittals and in minor penalties and never reached the level of the .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Could you describe the structure of the American prosecution team?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Well, the American prosecution, which I thought was a very good one, was headed by Justice Jackson. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He was the chief prosecutor and he made a magnificent opening statement at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">His deputy was General William Donovan. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Old Bill Donovan of the fighting 69s of World War I, and then the rest of the group was composed of lawyers from the <span class="BUILDING">Judge Advocate Office</span> of members of the OSS like myself, of Navy officers, Army officers, most of them with the exceptions of the OSS members, were in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I wore a uniform but more for ornamental purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I was what they called a major at the time, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But they were a military tribunal after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You saw the defense of course was not in uniform and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> wasn't except I believe the Russian judges were in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Not the Americans, and not the French, certainly not the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  In preparation of these trials did you visit any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Not in preparation, but while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I took time off to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> , which was only a few miles down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We had a guided tour by I think one of the former inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We went through the famous <span class="DLF">gate</span> , "Labor Makes You Free" or something like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They showed us some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">In one of them I still detected some bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They showed us the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where the prisoners were torn apart by dogs and they showed us the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">That was after all a few months after the so-called liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">That was an experience that no one can forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I know that Eisenhower went there too at the time, well a few months earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Yes, I saw that, but I never saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Did you interview any of the survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Oh, many of them, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Some of them were friends who suddenly emerged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">One was quite well known, Norbert Wllheim, who is one of the key figures now in the Holocaust program. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">His son and his former wife were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He survived and he went free, escaped, and got back to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and is now in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and I see him infrequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I see many others too, and their stories are invariably the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">There are no six million lies, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Well, that's more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I went eventually into the diplomatic service because I thought the two things I wanted to do for in German affairs were punishment of the guilty and the resurrection of the democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I had done as much as I thought I could do and I went to Diplomatic Service and I was acting ambassador in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to and eventually concluded my diplomatic career working for the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I was the first special assistant in the State Department for Environmental Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Is there any final comment that you'd like to make concerning your experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Well, I have made all the comments I wanted to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">A manuscript which hasn't been published yet in which I recounted for them my time from my childhood in <span class="REGION">Imperial Germany</span> , in the Weimer Republic, in the Third Reich, to the war and the post war period and I believe that I don't claim any special credits for anything I've done but in a form, but in a way at least in it's first part, my life was the life of a quintessential German Jew who reaped all the benefits <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had to offer in the early times and also witness and was victimized by the horrific collapse of all values we cherish under Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I've no regrets that I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We were typical as I said in the beginning, German Jewish middle class frapling, and not only we but going back to my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My grandfather on my mother's side was a who fought twice for his king against <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and was in fact imprisoned and returned, triumphantly, I suppose to his little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rastrailia</span> where he became the king of all marksman. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He was a very good marksman, and they had an annual fair there and he never failed to get the crown. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He was as German and Jewish as they come. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So was the whole family, all of them stuck to their loyalties and to their convictions throughout World War I and World War II and thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">All of them of that generation are now gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Conclusion of Interview </span>
