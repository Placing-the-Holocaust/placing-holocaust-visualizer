<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you please tell us your name and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Leo Bretholz. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Do I have to spell that? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I usually do have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  In what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Tell us about the family which you grew up in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Our family was a normal, or what you might call a “normal family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My parents were -- came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> right after the first World War, married in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and there were three children in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There would have been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I was the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My sister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">A normal family, as I said, with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and activities, fun -- although some of that was disrupted by the death of my father in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was nine years old, the oldest at the time of the three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My father was 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But that was all bearable and we coped as best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We do not want to forget that in those years it was still, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  And these were hard times. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Just as here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the middle ‘30s, latter ‘30s, we had to make with -- make ends meet with what was available to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And income -- my mother was a, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And the real, the real tragedy began then in 1938 with the annexation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Where that family structure, that family entity as in So many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">When we grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It so happens that I lived in a district in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> where there were more Jews than in other <span class="REGION">districts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">20th district</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span> had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other <span class="REGION">districts</span> had -- but the majority of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> were non-Jewish or very few Jews and antisemitism was almost a part of daily life. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it just became part of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes part of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But from time to time, there were denigrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Sometime we were spit at. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Sometime we were singled out for a particular rough treatments in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When I think back to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were Set apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which automatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And at Christmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood even if we wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in trimming a tree or sharing 1n, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all surface. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater community where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But the excesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression years. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that all these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we asserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> , we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for that by people who were looking at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But 1t was a segment in history that does not reflect too well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into ‘38, it 1s very easily perceptible. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You can touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">You can feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You could see it, that as soon as the Austrian Anschluss’ took place, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several months, the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months than the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did in the previous five years from ‘33 to ‘38. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It lent itself -- the climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> lent itself more to antisemitic excesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Give us examples. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">What happened to Leo Bretholz?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had been arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could -- ' Term used to described the incorporation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in the German Reich on March 11, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I had already left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And an aunt of mine had left for <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> right after the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was my mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it will be very bad, as we can see. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">People were arrested every day and within days or the most a few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Now whether they were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But they received a container with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to escape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to escape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But there were these, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the people who were freed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> periodically brought back other horror stories, so we know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it 1s constantly a source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But then when I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as these, he confirmed to me that, “Would your mother be able to speak today, she would still say...she was glad she did it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me out and saving my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She was a good woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My mother was what you might call in, in Hebrew, it's described as ““Eshet Khayil,”” -- woman of valor. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">She did the best she could under the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She and my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  What did she do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people, people that were less well-off than we or less fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Always helped somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">There was this poor painter around the corner from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">When the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> needed painting, she called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And when it was finished, the painting wasn't -- the painted room was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job because he needed it for his family, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But, I got to get myself together to make this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Let's pull it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Pull it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Your mother...
ANSWER:  She urged me to leave, and I did leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblenz</span> , to the west of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> , the ancient <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">By arrangement with a committee in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> ; it was called the Ezra * Woman of valor (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Who were the Ezra Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS,” perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Aid to refugees that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg</span> , provide some shelter, provide food, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and help these people who could not stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> unless they had regularized, temporary documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Others that fled and came illegally, could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And the Ezra committee was such a committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And a Mr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , was in the employ of Ezra. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In a way because later when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , he was also the one that smuggled us into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , but I am jumping ahead here. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But we were -- I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> , and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> and smuggled me across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Actually he took me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sauer River</span> and asked me cross and then meet him at the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sauer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And during the night from October 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He had asked me to put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had crossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I didn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">When he told me I was to cross that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I said, "Yes, I know how to swim." </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I said, "Would it be necessary, you think?" </span><span class="sentence" id="102">because he told me I would wade across. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But no way could I wade across that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> after four days of rain because that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> springs in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ardenne Mountains</span> and comes down. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It's a, it's really a tributary of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Moselle</span> , a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which under normal circumstances is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span> , a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I went there later in years with, with my family to get to that same <span class="REGION">area</span> , and people were just waiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the dry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My concern was to get across. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I did! </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and my aunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Or at the moment, relative safety, because three days later, I was arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The police came into this <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> where I was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Actually, my coat was still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so they arrested me and took me to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and I spent the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Luxembourg jail</span> -- by the way, a very clean <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the next morning, they interrogated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">How did I come over? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I said, "I crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The river Sauer." "</span><span class="sentence" id="117">Who brought you over?" </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I said, "TI just crossed." "</span><span class="sentence" id="119">And how did you get into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="120">T just walked into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I * Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">wasn't going to say, "Mr. Becker brought me over." </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And, well, it is my choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I have two choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I can pick a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I want to be taken to out of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , either <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So the choice was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I said, "Well, I have an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Maybe I can make my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So they decided, yes, take me to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to this Luxembourg<span class="DLF">-French border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There is a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called Thionville-les-Bains. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It is like a <span class="BUILDING">thermal spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they took me there and they -- the next morning -- and they -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commuter train</span> that went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , just about a half an hour or 40 minute ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But earlier before we went- before we took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , when they went to the ticket to, to, to show that to the <span class="DLF">ticket window</span> that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to have transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , appeared at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and he wore a cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he was standing on the side, and I noticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it around. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There is an expression in Yiddish which translates ““Turn the visor around,” which to me meant, “If you can come back, come back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And when they had taken me to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the <span class="DLF">border</span> , just a few hundred yards inside <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> , they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">That's all they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And they will probably be able help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But when I told them earlier, "How do you want me to manage going into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> by myself? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Can you --” They said, "Well, you just told us that you managed to swim a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and come into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now if you could make it across a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , you will make it across <span class="REGION">dry land</span> , we know." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They were sort of patronizing me but also very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They were not in any way vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They were just doing their job to get me out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">As I crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">preparatory camp</span> , hakh’sharah,” where, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyalr to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I got into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and somebody at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> actually stopped me, wanted to know who I am, and I said, "I am a Jewish fellow, just escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The Luxembourg people told me -- Luxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me....” “Well, they do that periodically just to make you feel that when you get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , you will be all right.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="151">There will be no problem so that they should be off the hook. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But actually as many as we get here periodically, we do get some. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We always have to tell them that the French authorities tolerate us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We have only temporary permits to live in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and if we are being in any way compromised to give you shelter, to help you further your, your travel in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , they will dissolve this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so we can't do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Being that far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and not having money on me, I thought of my uncle's turning the visor around and waited until * Special training for youth preparing to settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">° Immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="157">nightfall to cross back into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and made my way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg city</span> during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The last leg of that trip was in early morning catching a farmer with bales of hay or whatever he was carrying on his wagon to get me to the city line of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And from there I found my way to the address of my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">An hour later I showed -- a couple of hours later I showed up at the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where she lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I rapped on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and my uncle stood there and my aunt was sick in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> from, from aggravation that she had brought me there and now I was arrested again. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was a kid of 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">She -- that aunt lives today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She is in her 80s. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">She is my father's, my father's youngest sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And as soon as I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , my uncle said, turning to her, "I told you he'll be back." </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So, then they prevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> where about a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I stayed there from the night of the second, third of November to the ninth -- six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And the night of the ninth to the 10th of November, exactly Kristallnacht night, Mr. Becker took six or seven of us into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , smuggled us into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And it was during that night that we saw the strange phenomenum looking to the east as we traveled in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of skies that had changed their color. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was the night sky, but we could see reflections almost some eerie looking reflections of reddish-purplish coloration and it was only the next morning 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> that we found out that Kristallnacht had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> had been set afire and, of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> being in this <span class="REGION">tristate area</span> , Belgtum/Luxembourg/<span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we were very close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And chances are the flames that we saw reflecting were those that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblenz</span> or other <span class="DLF">border</span> , <span class="DLF">border</span> , localities that were evidently destroyed in that night of horror which many considered the beginning of the end of the European Jews -- Judaism, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You are now in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  The next day after we had contacted the Jewish committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they gave us transportation to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which 1s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that goes every 20 minutes; a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerpen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Within an hour, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , again going to the Aid Committee who were registering us, giving us food coupons, and trying to help us regularize our situation as refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I met an uncle of mine there who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ., </span><span class="sentence" id="180">my mother's brother, distant relatives which came from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as my mother, which we found out about. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And from November '38 to May 1940, I spent 18 months in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , which were pleasant months with distant relatives and friends, constantly under the pressure of not being sent -- avoiding to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they also had camps for these refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Somebody working in that committee, also a Viennese fellow who worked there in, in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> helping out with paperwork made sure that when the time came to select people for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I was not being considered for it because they tried to get me into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to register in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And having registered in that <span class="BUILDING">Flemish school</span> , I became authorized to stay with a temporary ID card which I have here with me, too, as a memento. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And periodically we knew that temporary permit to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which, in Dutch -- Flemish -- was called "Openbaar Beroep School voor J ongens,”” which means "Public Trade School for Boys." </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I took a course in electrotechnical, studies, you know, was a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Took also languages and I learned Flemish almost, almost to perfection. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I had good marks in the Flemish language and as a young man you learn faster, and I had a facility for languages anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So that's why I was in this <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">With my distant relatives in 1939, I went for a week's vacation to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">All along I got letters from my mother and sisters that they were coping, that things were at the normal rate as normal can be considered, and I always had intended to bring them over, but I didn't have the money to do it, because you had to pay a smuggler. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And they themselves were not really urging me, my mother and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Because they -- the mood was that “How long can this last?” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">or this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was constantly that hope against hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">How much can it last? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Although when my uncle brought his wife and daughter and son over to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , he had to pay an amount, whatever it was, to the smuggler. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I asked him why it wasn't possible to bring my mother also- at least suggest. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So he said, you know, they had to leave on quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Nobody could know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">The fewer people knew about it, the better 1t was, and again the money aspect was something that we didn't even discuss because that sort of becomes something of a very delicate situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But my mother and sisters did not come and actually, really didn't urge me to do something for them to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They felt it'll, it'll work itself out. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Then in '42, we found out differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> then, then, of course, in 1939, the War broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So after 1939, September 1939, there was no longer any question of anybody leaving from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">By that time even they had wanted to...had they wanted to leave, there would be no problem, no way to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That would be a problem, you see, would have been because the war was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The Germans were fortifying the <span class="DLF">borders</span> and <span class="DLF">Maginot Line</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> further to the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There was no possibility any longer after '39 for anybody to come across, although some tried and did. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But it wasn't as open and free as up to the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And, of course, in 1940, in May 1940, on the 10th of May, the Germans attacked the lowlands, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Where were you and what where you doing when the Germans attacked ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  That is the day that I will never have to guess where I was, because I was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I had a hernia and I had decided to see a doctor and rather to go on with a hernia bothering -- having from time to time -- why not do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And on Thursday night, May the ninth, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerpen</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerpen</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchen</span> and the same evening they prepared me for the operation of next day, meaning cleaning my body, shaving, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And operation was to take place next day, about seven in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Between 5:00 and 6:00, Friday the 10", fire bombs were flown over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerpen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Visibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We could actually see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">In fact one of those bombs dropped right into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And the order came for those who were ambulant to pick up their documents in ° Public Trade School for Boys (Flemish). </span><span class="sentence" id="223">the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , never been operated on. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I made my way, not where I lived in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> where my distant relative lived, and I made my way to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And that time I already found out that there were notifications, proclamations that all aliens of enemy alien origin have to register with the <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Although I had Polish nationality due to the fact that my parents were never naturalized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I as a Viennese-born person could not be an Austrian until I would have been 21 years old with the first military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It's not like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">When you are born <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you are an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And so I was, to all intent and purposes, also a Polish citizen which showed on my ID, and I went and registered and in good faith, hoping that they will see “Polish citizen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I couldn't have done differently anyway because they would have caught me or perhaps I could have fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But in good faith, I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Like many hundreds did. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I am, number one, I am of Polish nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And the Poles are Allies because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had been attacked, and besides that, even born in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or others in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we were the first victims of this Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We are here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We came here looking for shelter, for refuge, as people who ran away from that system. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So we're certainly not enemies of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We are enemies of that system. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But in bureaucracy, that doesn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When you are born on enemy in <span class="REGION">enemy territory</span> , that makes you an enemy alien, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took us to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">After we were arrested, we were told to bring a change of clothes, a toothbrush, a blanket, and food for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And they transported us to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Ironically enough, Germans were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">German Nazis were with us in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They also had to register, but to them that was just a formality because eventually they knew they would be exchanged for Belgium nationals because that goes in international relations as a normal procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But we as Jews, number one, we were not exchangeable, and number two, we wouldn't have wanted to be exchanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Were we arrested, number one, we would have wanted to, and number two, we were not exchangeable, whichever. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">For us, that didn't count.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Belgians have deported you as an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You are going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  To a camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The ironic, more irony, that when we got out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> where we stopped for one night near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">When we looked at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the facing of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , in white paint, it was marked 5th Column -- "Cinquieme Colonne.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So they transported us as Fifth Column people. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">No wonder that when we traversed the <span class="REGION">French countryside</span> from north to south that in those small <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> where we did, where we made periodic stops, that people were doing this to us [making “slitting throat” gesture]. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They thought we were, you know, Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> , a camp in the Department of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pyrénées-Orientales</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , right near the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> near a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perpignan</span> . ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Fifth Column (French).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> was a -- an established <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="264">That was -- this was 1940, so that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been established somewhere between '36 and '38, mainly holding Spanish refugees that had come into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> due to the Civil War in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">People had left <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ; the duress of the war- fled into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> at the time, was nothing but beach. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So these refuges from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> had come there, and established a camp facility. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">First they had <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , then they built <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with undulated metal roofs and later more <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were built, but the floors in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were not floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They were sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It was just the uprights were there and the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , it was just the sand of the, of the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And there, straw was put on there and we were lying on that sand on that straw in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> -- shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">As we walked through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , or to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to pick up the rations, we walked sometime on bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">A jaw bone here, a tail bone there, a skull here there of domestic animals, donkeys and horses and goats and dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The Spaniards had brought these animals with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were people who had a little livestock. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They brought them with them, and in the process they died or they killed them even for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And this, this was the scene there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> periodically -- the tide carried the waters up to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and sometimes right into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the ones that were closest to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">A beautiful sight it was scenically because there was the Mediterranean and there in the not too distant future were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrénées Mountains</span> jutting right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mediterranean</span> , so scenically this was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And if any of us had thought to escape, that wasn't possible because at the end of the <span class="DLF">beach</span> where the <span class="DLF">beach</span> meets the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , you had <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol boats</span> were cruising so if somebody would go through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and try to swim, they would be detected. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The better way to escape would have been trying to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and then by foot make it into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Be this as it may, we got there in May of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Sometime in July or early August, and I couldn't pinpoint that, dysentery developed in -- broke out in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There were a handful of latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">male section camp</span> and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">female section camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There was a handful of latrines, and with the condition under which we labored, it was a constant <span class="DLF">line</span> to these latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they were elevated on stilts because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> would come tn -- the seat of the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> would be covered, so it was on stilts. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So you walked up those stilts and there was that one <span class="DLF">door</span> , that <span class="DLF">swinging door</span> like, and you would go up there and relieve yourself and as soon as you were sitting down somebody rapped on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so you had to get out and get in <span class="DLF">line</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And there was no paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">There was no tissue paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There was not even a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So what we used was straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It's awful to bring back these things, but these are all segments of dehumanization that people go through and you somehow cope with it because you live and you hope you will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What happened later, of course, these situations were almost bearable, sometimes even comical. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I escaped from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with another fellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Tell us about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Some people that we knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> as Belgian citizens with a stream of refugees into the <span class="REGION">area</span> , this is the general <span class="REGION">southern area</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrénées</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">One of our friends by the name of Oesterreicher had finally arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> and he had inquired with the authorities where some of the people that were transported into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And they told him, the foremost reception for these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they called them “Centre d'Accueil,”® -- Center of -- Reception Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Like they had a red carpet out for us, or something like that.. These euphemisms, they have their way of creeping into a language and then that's what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And they found out that we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and Oesterreicher wrote to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We could receive mail there. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Communication between people who had left in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and others that left by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on their own volition because they want to get away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, sort of, families through Red Cross and through authorities found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That's communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Slowly as it went, it still helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And Oesterreicher found out that we, that we were taken to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and asked the commandatur, the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to issue a visiting permit so that he can visit his friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And they called me that there is a friend here visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I got dressed, went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">visiting area</span> , and he told me then, "Why don't you go back and get your shoes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was barefoot. “</span><span class="sentence" id="313">Get your shoes, get your clothes because I think you can get out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I say, "How do you do it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He said, "I see that these guards here are not very watchful. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They are half asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They talk to the internees. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They exchange cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You can give them cigarettes and you can give them chocolates and they will be, will be looking away, maybe.” </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and took my things and told my uncle who was there with me from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and his son, a cousin, that I am leaving with a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They were not amenable to fleeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They said, “Oh, we will.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="325">because they had, they had -- he had his wife still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , the other one had his wife still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , so they were not going to go anywhere where, where, where their wives may have, have no knowledge where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">In other words, you are there, and you hope that these authorities will take care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">As you saw others were exchanged, you hoped that you perhaps would be let out and -- but with the situation that it was, that there was dysentery and all this illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The guards themselves were not crazy about guarding these people because they're not immune to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I mean, dysentery can spread across a barbed wire too, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So they relaxed their watchfulness. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And my friend was right!

<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  Yeah, in, in, in, my aunt from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She had already earlier brought an uncle, two uncles and two aunts, a brother and sister here with their respective mates. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , that was on that day of Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There was no more processing of documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So my affidavit to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> fell by the wayside. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">It expired. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So that later after the war, after I had survived, I got fresh papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bagneéres</span> , we were notified that we would have to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cauterets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cauterets</span> sometime after the first of the year early in '42, probably in the springtime of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Again, the two men went there ahead of time and picked a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Pergola</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And also the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they name the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Call them one thing or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">A name or a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The Lindenhouse (ph) or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">When we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cauterets</span> , we, at that point, frankly, we felt confined. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">For the first time since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luchon</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bagneres</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cauterets</span> too was a thermal spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">A lot of, about 1500 inhabitants during the year, but during the summer season, it, it could rise to about maybe 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="510"><span class="BUILDING">Thermal spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">There were about a thousand or 1500 of us sent into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into <span class="BUILDING">forced residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It was called residence assignee. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We called it "Résidence Forcée.”"” </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Even for those people who do not speak French, I think “Assignée”’° speaks for itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Well, again we tried to make the best of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And we did excursions into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to pass the time, and we gathered and listened to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Of course, by that time some of the listening of the Radio, Radio London was prohibited, but we still heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Bumm, bumm, bummm, You familiar with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The first bars of the Fifth Symphony.

<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Okay, let's pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The mayor, tell us about the mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  We never met the mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But what he did at the time was a great thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He notified us and left it up to us to do what, he wasn't going to say, “I am going to put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at your disposal and send you all out of here or trucks” or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Do what you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I just want you to know that this <span class="NPIP">place</span> is no longer safe for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">A handful of us took to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , 1n fact, and we stayed a couple of days and couple of nights up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Periodically sending someone down. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Once I went down, then somebody else, to find out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The first few hours nothing had changed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the people were still there, although very apprehensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">By that time, the mood had drastically changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The parents had to console their kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They had to tell them, ““We may leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They started packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Some of us, as I said, took to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , a handful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  The rest stayed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  Stayed! </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Two days later when finally the messenger that we had sent out came back and said, "It's finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Most people are gone." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That's when we came back from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">In fact, the message was that when I knew they were going down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , "Go over the to Frajermauers and see if they are still there." </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Low and behold, the Frajermauers were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They had Belgian documentations. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Those who apatrides, '* means stateless, Polish, German, Austrian, were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Those who had French, Belgian, and Luxembourg nationality were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Another psychological ploy to tell them, "You are safe." </span><span class="sentence" id="563">In the final analysis, no one was. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Because when you look at the book of the Klarsfelds,’” many people do not know that, but there were Americans and Swiss and Finns and Swedes and Norwegians who were Jews deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Those passports didn't matter at all to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But the ploy was there at this particular point. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">When you look back at this whole period -- the Nazi period, the deportations -- you see one psychological aspect of the progress of that dehumanization after the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  You are in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> caught in the middle of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You are about to come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bigorre</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  I went right to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Pergola</span> , saw the Frajermauers. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They said, "You know, we are here because we are Belgians, but we don't know how long." </span><span class="sentence" id="573">In fact, they were not Belgians. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">The children were, the two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">That's why they left the family with them. “</span><span class="sentence" id="576">But you cannot stay here.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="577">But let's wait and see what we can think about.” </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and hid in '® Without nationality, stateless (French).

id="799">And so they came in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and said, "We know you are up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Why don't you just come down and make it easier."

</span><span class="sentence" id="803">To them it didn't really matter, because to them people came and went constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">This was just another transport they had to do, and they wanted to just numerically have the right amount of people and to know that nobody had escaped, because that would reflect on their efficiency. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So when they have x amount of people to take and count it in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> the night before and the next day these people have to be transported, so that number better be the same number that you counted the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">That's all they were concerned with. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Not the punishing me with -- if they had punished me and put me in a <span class="BUILDING">brig</span> , I would have preferred that because my deportation would have been delayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But that's not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> on the 20 or the 22nd of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We were taken by transport -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Another ploy to make us feel are we going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so, by that time all of us had been used to <span

class="sentence" id="812">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> -- by that time, we in the south had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> but did not quite realize the

</span><span class="sentence" id="814">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Again in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , several times going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> , I looked at the situation over. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Escape was always on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Maybe this is the, the deep urge to live and, and experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But there was no, there was no getting away from that <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> because the gendarmes stood right in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> when somebody went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">It was not like the gendarmes were riding in another <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And you know how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French trains</span> are, were at that time anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> had their own <span class="DLF">door</span> to walk in, so was no use trying it there and again, let's wait until the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and see what we can do later. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> and checked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">The checking-in process in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> was, well, a first step n a, in a real dehumanization process. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Number one, when we arrived there, the faces that we saw, the, the eyes with queries in them and, and a lot of questions, "Where are you coming from? </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="830">Everybody gathering about a new group of arrivals because they may, they may have something to convey and we went through a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> process of checking in which would also mean taking your watch away, your rings, certain belongings, money. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And another psychological ploy: giving you a receipt for the things that they took from you, with the admonition, "Don't lose that!" </span><span class="sentence" id="832">because you will never get them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">That is your receipt that has a number on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">It had a number on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Just imagine that! </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And people there tried to sort of whisper to us that this isn't good here. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And we knew, as we came in, the mood immediately, it wasn't Rivesaltes any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It was not Rivesaltes by any stretch of the imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="839"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> that was built to be a <span class="BUILDING">military barracks facility</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">It was a multi-story complex almost like a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> because it was round. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">But due to the war, beginning of the war, that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , that structure, was never finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that they put us In were wide open, <span class="INT_SPACE">concrete floor</span> with piping laying around and half-installed electrical wires, half-installed plumbing, makeshift, and it was concrete. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Windows -- no, no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , There were no panes in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It was just the opening where the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were supposed to go in the frames later. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">That wasn't done so it was all open, breezy. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And on this concrete, straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Men, women, children together. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Minimal facilities to wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Community, one <span class="DLF">trough</span> like, where you, where the water ran down from in trickle. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Minimum toilet facilities. </span><span

“civilization.” </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Minimal food distribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That's where we were issued the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">This 1s where we had to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">The population in <span class="REGION">northern France</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied

arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> had to put that on because this was the administration of the German authorities. "</span><span class="sentence" id="859">Juif" --- French for "Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="860">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , it was "Jood;" in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , "Jude." </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I cannot fail to mention that, because I always mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And it has to be mentioned over and over and over again, that the German propaganda told you that a Jew, you can smell them a mile away. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">A Jew, you know when you see a Jew, from a distance, you can smell him, you see his actions, you see, there's no way where you can mistake a Jew for what he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So the obvious thing, question is, it's a rhetorical question and even young children to whom I speak periodically in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I ask that and I say, so what is your next question then. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they would say, "So why did you need that star?" </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And some young people, eight, nine year old, says, "I know why." </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I said, "Tell me." </span><span class="sentence" id="868">He says, "To humiliate you." </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And for a child that's a big statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">He understands that. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So we had this star and we were easily recognizable, yet we had to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So that destroys their whole thesis, their whole propaganda, and their propaganda can be destroyed in thousands of ways because nothing ever made sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It only dwelt on the, on the, on the emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  Go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So you were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">What happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  We saw utter despair, uncertainty, acts of, of aggression, pushing, shoving, end of rifle butts, and threats. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And it wasn't until I saw a newborn baby being shot like a clay pigeon, and the mother being killed too because she threw herself into the path of the bullet, that I spoke to my friend, Manfred Silberwasser. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And I said, "Manfred, if this can happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , what can we expect where we're going to? </span><span class="sentence" id="881">This is <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">This is not yet <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="883">There was no question of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> yet, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the rumors that had come back to us were, were we didn't even want to think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">We didn't even want to believe that, that that was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But this was November 1942; and in January 1942, the, the, the Wannsee Conference had decided on the Final Solution of which the news had only trickled down to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And everybody was always suspicious, leery of that, that cannot happen, take people for thousands of miles to gas them to kill them and then the -- always came back that there were always rumors in the First World War that turned out to be just that -- rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And I said, "Fred, what we hear about what's possible, how they're going to... And we must do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Now if these are rumors and we prove to be wrong at the end of the war, then so be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I would rather be wrong at the end of the war than not be prepared now to do something about this." </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They take your watch away, your toothbrush, glasses, eyeglasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They would leave you the eyeglasses, but when somebody had very thick eyeglasses where it was very necessary for that person to carry to see your hand in front of your eyes, those they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">That's the torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Somebody that had two eyes that needed for reading glasses, they left them those. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They were very selective as to how they moved that, that psychological ploy. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And compacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">A compact to a woman and lipstick to a woman is, 1s something to hold onto. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Her person is a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Without that she is not fully a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Or the same thing for a -- combs they took away from us, because they could be a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But we didn't need it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They shaved our hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  What did you do then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Well, on the sixth of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We had one sign while we were there of something hopeful when towards the beginning of November, the skywriters were flying overhead in the Paris sky and I also later witnessed bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But these skywriters wrote "Le Huit,” Le Hutt, L-E H-U-I-T" which means "the eighth." </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And on the eighth of November, on a Sunday, November the eighth, the Allies landed in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So they were playing games with those things, but they just wanted to let the French population know that on the eighth, you can expect something. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">They had these little things going on periodically to encourage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  When did you know you were going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  Thursday the fifth, in the morning, they notified us that we will be leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">In the afternoon of the fifth, Thursday, took us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Bourget</span> , in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Again, we looked how we can jump off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , but that would have been of foolishness because the guards were right on there and anybody who would jump would be shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And people -- we, my friend and I, when I say “we,” had a, an advantage, namely that we were not with family. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">A husband would not jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and leave his wife and children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">That's for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Or a young child that is without parents will not try to run away because he or she was told that where you are going, you are going to meet your parents, and vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Parents were taken and were told where you are going you're going to meet your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Because the kids were taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and brought in and the parents, again "tohoo va-vohoo." </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And we were taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Now it could have been 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00, somewhere around this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">November it gets dark early. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">It was a, a sort of a misty type <span class="REGION">northern France</span> fall, raw day. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> at 50 * Bight (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="926">per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I understand from other people who were in the east, in those cases, they even had a hundred per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Fifty per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> which was bad enough of a, what I like to call, microcosm of humanity abandoned by the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Everybody, old and young and from all professions, from all walks of life, from all economic strata, from every segment of the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Children alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Crippled people. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">People on stretchers. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Counted out 50 per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Now, Linda, imagine yourself in a situation where you and a husband and two children are at the end of rifle butts pushed into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , counted out, ", 48, 49, 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">In!" </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Fifty-one would have been the other child. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">This other child does not go with his parents and sibling into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">This child is at this point separated and put into the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , counted out as number one going into the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">You might say they are separated by one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> length but in fact they are separated by an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They are worlds apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And a good chance is -- a bad chance -- is that that child will never see the parents again, and the parents will never see that child again. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And the trauma of that family is indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I can say words; they are not answerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I can express thoughts; they are unthinkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Even to express them is almost a ludicrous endeavor. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Dehumanization to the worst degree! </span><span class="sentence" id="947">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  You're 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> -- tell me what they did with the <span class="DLF">doors</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  They shut them closed, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">These <span class="DLF">sliding doors</span> , they were closed shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , just latch-locked -- heavy metal latches. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And that was in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Now, the good thing would have been for this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">But it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It did not leave until next morning, about 12 hours later, 12 or 14 hours later, in the early morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">As I see the report in the Klarsfeld book, it was something like 8:05. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Because there was a precise schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But to be all night in a waiting standing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is much more torture than being riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">When you are riding, you, you see progress, you see something is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Sitting there is like being the expression "sitting ducks." </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And, of course, in that particular confinement you have a whole gamut of emotions running their course. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">You have resignation, you have despair, openly expressed; a lot of crying, a lot of moaning, some praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">A young man with a gangrenous leg and knee attempting to make love to a young woman in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">He did that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Call that an expression of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Call it an expression of, perhaps, resignation of what else can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Call it whatever you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">It was an act, perhaps this was the, because perhaps this was the one human act that really happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">He didn't force that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">She didn't cry or shout or resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">But it points up that what happened in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was, all privacy of a human being was, had been taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">There's no more privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">How can you, with one bucket in the center of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Everybody relieving themselves in that one bucket -- man, women, and children -- because you had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">You had reached the common denominator of dehumanization. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">There was no such thing as "I am a man, I can't show it," and, "I am a woman, I can't do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And people were still thinking that there was something of humaneness ahead of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We recently saw that film about one remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">The one stark scene that I -- my family didn't want me to see that at all, and I only saw glimpses of it, like snitches of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">But at the end, I saw that one scene where the woman open, stands in the open <span class="DLF">door</span> of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> confronted by the SS officer at the arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And she said to the person, "We have seven dead people in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And he laughed and said, "Well, these are the lucky ones." </span><span class="sentence" id="983">That points it all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">That that woman speaking to this SS officer thought she was really confronting a human being who could understand this tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And this is why people throughout the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> were trying to talk us out of running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">We had decided to make our getaway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  Who is "we"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  My friend and I.
QUESTION:  And you are still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">You had not yet began to move?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  We hadn't moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We were squatting, standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">We moved in human waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">The stench is still up here, and it's, it's powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">There were three of us who planned, but two only escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And some tried to talk us out of it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="996">Look what can happen to us if they find you escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They will kill us all!" </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And our answer at this point was, "So what do you think awaits us, anyway?" </span><span class="sentence" id="999">They were some in previous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> who tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And one man was caught under the wheels and was then thrown back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with two legs amputated to bleed to his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And people died anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Maybe some suicides. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">There was this woman in crutches in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , pointing her crutch at me 1n, in, in weapons style, like a weapon, like a dagger -- pointing it and telling me, "Que Dieu vous garde!" -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Let God keep you! </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">You must do what you want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Don't let anybody talk you out of it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">You be-- To her, we were a symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">We were a symbolism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Perhaps it will succeed, and then we can tell something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">A woman in crutches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Every bit in her 70s, with streaky gray hair and deep, sad, dark, sad eyes, actually consoling a child that was there without a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I don't know whether that father or mother was along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">The child was there crying, and she was in charge of that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And Tony was there -- a distant cousin of mine -- and her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">She was the one that had sewed on my star in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And under the star, I had a half a pound note of Irish pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Under the star, under this star, there was a half a Irish pound note that I had salvaged over the last several years, sent to me by an aunt who had immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">She had sent me that to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , periodically, and I saved that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Didn't want to spend it or exchange it, just for an emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Didn't even know what the value of it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But 1t was something to hold on to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Tony sewed that onto me; said, "Why do you want that there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I said, "I want it under the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Sometime when I tear this star off, 1f I do run away, I would like to have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Maybe I can buy some bread or some -- buy a train ticket with it, or what have you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But it was some, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And we planned on our getaway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">ANSWER:  I have repeated that so often, and I don't want to over-dramatize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I don't want to be pleading any kind of heroship or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But the kids, when I speak about it, to them this is like an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We are not heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I don't even exult in the word "surviving" because it speaks of something so, so exclusive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">You survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">How many did survive, really? </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So, it's almost like you are putting down those who couldn't survive, and you exult in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">It was fear, utter fear, that prevailed upon us to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Two little words: fear and luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">One has to motivate you, and the other one 1s there to hopefully let you succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Luck, you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">This is luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And it's only --
QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">ANSWER:  First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they call hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a monument that that, of some hero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You make a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Heroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">How did we do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">There was only one way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or cut out the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And these <span class="DLF">windows</span> were squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But you see, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> they are normally called "huit, quarante””” -- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Both <span class="DLF">windows</span> had bars, straight bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Two bars: the one on the one side facing the other <span class="DLF">track</span> that runs parallel had barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">That would not have prevented us from using that <span class="DLF">window</span> , because a barbed wire that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">A barbed wire can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the bars to contend with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But that <span class="DLF">window</span> was not in our plan, because that was the <span class="DLF">window</span> that was next to the other <span class="DLF">track</span> and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Especially from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">moving train</span> , because you can't really take that big chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I mean, you want to succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">The left side -- the north side, as it were, because we were traveling east -- was the one that faced the <span class="DLF">ravine</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> that are alongside and the telephone post, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">That's the <span class="DLF">window</span> we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to make our getaway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And as soon as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we had all night to think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">We were walking in, in, around in miserable conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I mean, we were sliding back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">So the only way we tried in the morning to move these bars, but it wasn't possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is by trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them wet, to create a tensile cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Dry cloth you cannot wring too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">A towel, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But a wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture has dripped out entirely until it's dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style when you use it on an arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We used that as a tourniquet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So if you figure that two bars, you twist that sweater around the <span class="DLF">bars</span> and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can, We helped each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">We tried that several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">It was no give yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">There was no give yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But we hoped that something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And then we moved in the <span class="NPIP">side</span> and see maybe it gets loose a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five minutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">We were working under pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">This was our getaway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">This was life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">There the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> flew by us, that bucolic countryside -- <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And this was -- we were approaching champagne country, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">The area of lusciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But here we were going to certain death, which now we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">At that > Bight, forty (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">time, we only speculated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But I am glad we did speculate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">It didn't let us fall into some sort of lethargy, like a lot of people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that glimmer of hope where the bars 1n the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that it 1s set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Rust came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set 1n like an inch or so, half an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But we hoped to, them to be bending. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">We worked for a while, and we saw them ever so slightly bend inward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Then we used our hands to move them apart again, so that they should start loosening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And it did that! </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">We moved them back into the proper <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever so slightly more of a bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And we put that again, did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">We worked all day, being mindful of the fact that if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would have to come to a stop, these things would have to be put into proper position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">They were in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> --that was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger car</span> --and the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">These were Gestapo, and these were the German guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And, of course, French police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">The French police, French collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">That's a chapter by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Towards the late afternoon, those bars had moved apart, through our efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And we put them back into the original position, just again in case the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would come to a stop and the guards would come up and inspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">One time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and the people there seeing it wanted to reach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">We shouted "Water!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three transports going by there every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But some of them, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> or hiding out somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would put stamps on them and mail them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Or just notes: "We are going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">We are going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Don't forget us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Cryptic notes like this, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">But they didn't let them approach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">We only made one stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- because it's in the book - when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would arrive at the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , and the German guards would take over everything by schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">But we did, Finally, under the cover of the darkness -- 1t could have been begin around seven o'clock, and it was dark at that time already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We did climb out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">My cousin Tony, distant cousin Tony Gutefreund handed me my rucksack through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I was the first one to step out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I dropped down, held onto that bar, and then reached my way to the back of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> to the coupling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Reaching for the coupling with my foot, and standing and holding on to this, and then holding to that metal tron -- wrought iron -- stepladder that leads up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , holding on to this, and stepping on those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I was already half free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I was standing there reaching my rucksack around, putting it only with one strap on my shoulder, and my friend came next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">He did the same procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">In fact, I told him already, "Now reach for the coupling -- la coupler.””</span><span class="sentence" id="1135">° I stepped over to the next

the, got up the nerve to do it, or perhaps he was noticed by someone that he was reaching out, because at that very moment or just seconds later, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went into a slight curve on the north side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">That's the side we intended to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And the curve is like a concave curve, which serves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">They are shining their flashlights up and down from the back and the front, and they cross somewhere in the middle, sort of a floodlight effect, to see that everything on the outside of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> is -- or those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , is still under control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">It is possible that they noticed that, because at that moment when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had come into that curve and somewhat slowed down--let's say, from 75 to 60 miles an hour or whatever, my friend standing on this coupling was the first to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And I jumped right after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But at that very moment, we heard whistles and shots fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Up to this day, I think that one or two things happened to our friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">He was caught in the crossfire of these beams and just didn't get out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">He was attempting to, maybe he was a little heavier than us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Whatever the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Or they may have caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Those shots, however, were fired before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a halt, because a few seconds later, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a screeching halt and we heard more shots fired -- probably in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Warning shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I don't think it was at our friend because I don't think he really ever made it out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">But that's conjecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And voices: "Let's look for...Let's search...Run up and down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We were lying there in that <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and that wet, tall grass, holding our breath together in a moment that seemed like hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But it was just a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And it wasn't until we heard no longer any voices and we heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> being set into motion again that we let our breath out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">For the first time in so many weeks, we were what you might call "free;" but at least -- if not entirely free, at least away from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was taking us to certain death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Because only 72 hours earlier, 48 hours earlier, we were there in utter despair, put into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">This was a total metamorphosis in a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">We tried to make our way, and did make our way, into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">By that time, everything was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And because of blackout -- war time -- the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were blue and blackened out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And we went to this big <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , rapped on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and an apprentice, a young man, came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told us that there was no bread, they are closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And we said, "Yes, we do not want bread at this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">But we would like for you to tell us where does the priest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> live." </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And he said, "Wait a minute." -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Un moment." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Just a minute." </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And he went in and got his jacket, came out with us and took us to the priest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , to his <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> -- like a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> sacristy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We rapped, rapped on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">We walked in, and the priest wanted to know, "What brings you here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">The baker said, "These young men asked for your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Then he walked off.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1189">What we want is, can we stay for the night?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">He said, "What you first want is, is make yourself clean a little bit." </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">We came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We were -- smelled to high heaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">We were infested.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1519">ANSWER:  I spent in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> nine months and two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">I was taken on the ninth of September 1943 out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and transported to a forced labor -- not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">A hard <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Septfond</span> , Department Tarn-et-Garonne. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">I was one of hundreds of prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> my friend with whom I had escaped had found out where I was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">He came to visit me, and he gave me an address that I can write to in case I manage to become free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">My correspondence to that camp, which I was entitled to receive for a month, I was sitting there banging stones, rocks, making it into small stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">My correspondence that I got there, I found out later, was kept and censored and not given to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">The correspondence that I sent out went out, but was also read and censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">So my friend came and gave me an address, and I memorized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">I didn't write it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">On the 15th of October, 1943, was the Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">And the Germans have a knack for doing that on a Jewish holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">The day before, on the 14th, we were informed that the next day we were going to be taken to Organization Todt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">That is the, the organization, German Organization Todt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">They were building fortifications named after Todt, who was the armament minister who was later replaced by Speer, and when Todt died Speer took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">Organization Todt was supposed to take us to the <span class="BUILDING">Atlantic War building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And there was 14 of us to be taken away for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And again, we discussed: "Will we really go there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">Is this just a ploy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Will we wind up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> again?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And there was a guard by the name of Kaufmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">He was an Alsace-Lorraine native -- spoke <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> fluently and French fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">To me he spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And sometimes also spoke French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">He said to me, "Bretholz, Morgen begleit Ich Si”! -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="1545">Tomorrow, I will be accompanying you,” and then there will be no more running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And you know what I said to him? "</span><span class="sentence" id="1547">Mr. Kaufmann, " Or, "Kaufmann, " Because prisoners and guards get sort of chummy there; they develop a relationship. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1548">Kaufmann, you want to know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">It is true you will accompany me tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">But whether I run away or not will not depend on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">It will strictly depend on me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">That's what I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">The next day, we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">A friend of mine in the camp befriended me in this month, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">His wife lived nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">She was going to come to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to bring him some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">They allowed that to happen, bring him some food for the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">She brought the two kids along, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">I said, "When you wife comes there, will you please ask her to buy me a ticket for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">He said, "What do you need a ticket *' Bretholz, tomorrow I accompany you (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I said, "If run away." </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">He said, "You are not going to run away." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1564">If I run away, I want to have a ticket." </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Because on the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> , out of the <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you have to present your travel ticket, to see that you haven't traveled for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">He said, ““What are you doing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I said, "Can she do it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">He said, "Sure, I'll tell her." </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">She bought a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">I gave them the little money that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">He gave it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">She bought me the ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">When we arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was standing -- this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> with those individual <span class="DLF">doors</span> leading to each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> -- when we were lined up there to be, to be prepared, ready to get into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I asked Kaufmann if I may go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">He said, "Oh, come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">You don't mean that." </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">He said, "You don't mean that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">What do you think, I am crazy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">I said, "Well, I can't blame you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">Okay, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">I can't blame you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">I'll wait until I am in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">That was to placate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">But when I saw, not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , but a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with <span class="DLF">doors</span> and <span class="DLF">windows</span> , I saw freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">But I placated him by saying, "Oh, I go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">Now, these foolish guards, We have about eight guards for 14 people, seven guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">Instead of going with us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , at least a couple of them, all seven were standing in front to see that we don't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And nobody watching what was going on in the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">So I said to my friend -- the one whose wife had bought the ticket for me -- "I am ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">Do you want to go with me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">He said, "No, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">My wife is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">My children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">I don't want to jeopardize my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">This is -- okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">I went to the <span class="DLF">back window</span> , inched to the <span class="DLF">back window</span> , and says, "You just stay there and see if Kaufmann and his cohorts are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">You just stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">When you see them come, then tell me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">I went to the <span class="DLF">back window</span> , lowered the <span class="DLF">back window</span> , dropped myself, lost a shoe in the process, one of those loafer- type sandals, that I put it back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">My beret fell off my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">I picked that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">My rucksack I still had, that steady companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">On the next track, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> parked on the, on the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">In standing position, I went under that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , went to the subterranean exit -- because I knew the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> -- walked up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">I had a ticket, but I never needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">I showed that ticket into the <span class="INT_SPACE">luggage room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">luggage room</span> , and I made out that I am looking for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="1607">It just arrived." </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">I said, "Where?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">He said, "Well, you have to have a, a, coupon." </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">You have to have a ticket for your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">I said, "Well, maybe my friend, my friend, maybe my friend has it, because we came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">But here's my train ticket." </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">I showed him the train ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">He said, "That is okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">I walked out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">luggage room</span> right into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">There was no friend waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">But I said, "My friend has it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I walked out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And I had friends 1n living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blagnac</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , and I made my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blagnac</span> and showed up at Jacques Estrajch’s place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And guess what he told me? "</span><span class="sentence" id="1621">I got your card you are going to the Organization Todt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">Did you get mine?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1623">No, I didn't get yours." </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">He said, "I wrote to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">Then I knew that I didn't get the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">And I also knew that as soon as I escaped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , the first place they will be looking at will be Blagnac, because that's the nearest <span class="NPIP">place</span> to my escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">He said, "Go upstairs and take a rest and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">If somebody comes, I'll tell him you are not here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">I slept two hours, I came down, and guess what he told me?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1635">QUESTION:  Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1636">ANSWER:  He took me to an elderly couple that was living there from, originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">They were living there in the southern zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">They kept me for a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">Kept me for couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">I wrote to my friend whose address I had memorized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">He sent me my false birth certificate, with an address where to go to and on the first of November, I joined an address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Vallier</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone River</span> south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> with the French underground, presenting myself with my birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">And from that moment on, I was Max Henri Lefévre. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">I was four years younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">I was born on the 25th of October in Saint Jouin-sur-Mer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">I knew the name of my father and mother, and legalized, regularized my situation with French ID papers under the name of Max Henri Lefévre.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1648">ANSWER:  You are out of breath, and so am I.
QUESTION:  Yes, that is quite a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">And we are done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">And it's only half of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">Now I want the whole other half in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">What we are going to have to do 1s to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">If you did not have the appointment now, I would go for another hour.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1655">QUESTION:  Yes, and I want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">Let us talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">Would you mind coming back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1658">ANSWER:  I can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1659">QUESTION:  Because all that in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">Conclusion of July 31, 1989 interview September 27, 1989 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Tape #4
QUESTION:  Let's take it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">You had arrived and you were being placed with an elderly couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">Tell us where you are, and tell me something about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1663">ANSWER:  This is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blagnac</span> -- B-L-A-G-N-A-C -- in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , one of the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">That's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I had reached in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> that I escaped from on that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">It was from a standing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the train station of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , as I explained previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">So I am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blagnac</span> ; my friend, Jacques Estrajch, takes me to this elderly couple, just con-- suggesting, or hoping that they would keep me just for a week or two until I can make arrangements for the future where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And they were very amenable, friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">I spent two weeks with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">The evening hours filled with -- the time of the evening hours was filled with listening to <span class="BUILDING">Radio London</span> , was broadcasting the news from the front, <span class="REGION">war fronts</span> , and all other news that pertained to the French Resistance and the war going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">And I contacted the friend with whom I had escaped in November of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">I had memorized his address and sent him the information where I was now located.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1672">QUESTION:  How did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1673">ANSWER:  Meaning what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1674">QUESTION:  Meaning, can one simply post a letter and expect it to get to its <span class="NPIP">destination</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1675">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you could just post a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">In <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> , that was in the, what you call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">If we're writing to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northern zone</span> , past the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> , there were special post cards that were printed in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , preprinted with, "I am well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">Please do this." </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">This was almost like a form letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">Between the occupied and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy Zone</span> , there was this controlled correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">But within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy Zone</span> , yes, they had the Vichy stamps and the Petain stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">These were not the same that were used in <span class="REGION">northern France</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">And I thus wrote to my friend that I was at this address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blagnac</span> , and a week or so later, I received in the mail a birth certificate which was made out to the name of Max Henri Lefévre: I was born in October of 1925, four years younger than what I was really was; and my mother's name so and so; and my father's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">And I had to memorize all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">And with that birth certificate, my friend, when he sent me this, sent me also a instructions as to where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">His brother had been -- had joined that particular group that he was sending me to, sometime earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">And this was a, an underground group in the area of -- south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Vallier</span> in the Department of Drome, south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">And I joined with the underground there in November of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1690">QUESTION:  Would you describe how you got there and what the group was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1691">ANSWER:  The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or the fascist regimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">There were some people that were still hold-outs from the Spanish Civil War that had come to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- this was seven, eight -- or six or so years later -- and had joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">There were a couple of German deserters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">There was -- were one or two of Russians, Georgian Russians or Russian Georgians, who, who had been incorporated into the German army after the Germans entered <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , took them captive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">They incorporated Ukrainians and other nationals from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> into their armed forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">So these people may have been hurt or may have been wounded and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">A lot of German soldiers came to <span class="REGION">northern France</span> to recuperate or ride out their injuries in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">Well, a couple of them then ran away and joined with the French underground because they were really against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">There were some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> , who traditionally were either violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">But there were many Alsace-Lorraine citizens who were deeply nationalistic French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">These people resisted the Germans just as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">And there were a few of those in the -- in that group, and a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">What was that group? </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">It was really a group called the, the Vichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">These people were prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">Learning crafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and that sort of thing, to prepare them for service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the new order, to be incorporated into the new order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">This was a Petain youth movement called Companion de France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">Their uniforms were blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">Their berets were blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">And they sang the Petain nationalistic songs in training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">This group took on the semblance of a Companion de France camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">When we -- when I presented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, “Chief de Camp,” Maurice Bardin -- B-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth certificate, he did not ask me any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">He says, "Welcome to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">We will call you 'Henri.' </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">That's what we will call you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">And they made out the ID for us, and I was accepted as one of the, of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">This group was mainly engaged 1n sending messages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">Messages from the mountains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savoy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , or sending emissaries up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> with certain instructions as to what to do when the next German column comes by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">But on the surface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">And in the morning, we would get up at 4:30 and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And I have a picture here shows the snows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">And we would take cold showers, because there was no warm water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">And after that we would have breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">But before the cold shower, we would run a mile or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">All part of the youth movement -- exercise before we start the day working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">But there were <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shops</span> and all kinds of other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">So if someone would come in and observe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a camp of Companion de France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and ID, so that I could take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was part of the Vichy government Companion de France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">But 80 percent of us were Jewish, hiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">It was not until sometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January - -that overnight we had to clear out the <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">The Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Vallier</span> had notified us that word has come from the French Milice -- the militia, the Vichy France collaborators with

QUESTION:  Lovely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1767">ANSWER:  She was a good lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">She kept a lot of Resistance people in her <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">She helped out wherever she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">She made sure we had ration cards for those who couldn't get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">I could, because I was living under the name of Lefevre. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">So I got my ration cards legally and legitimately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">But there were some of them who did not have false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">They were hiding out, and therefore could not go to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and get their ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">But Madame Bergot made sure they had either ration cards or bread -- either ration cards or coffee, or, or clothing like handkerchiefs, socks, underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">That was all rationed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1777">QUESTION:  Where did she get them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">How did she get them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1779">ANSWER:  Madame Bergot got them! </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">She may have known somebody at <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> that knew her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">She would never let on as to where, but there they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">When we went there in 1954, in that just few hours, my wife grew very fond of her, because you could see in that lady a -- what you might call in Jewish “eshet khayil””” -- a woman of valor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">And that she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">A beautiful person from the point of your heart and soul, and reaching out and helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">That was Madam Bergot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And, of course, I first went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chalus</span> , as I said, but later, I relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , which was only about 10 or 15 -- 10 miles or so, or 10 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chalus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">Although I went back quite often to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chalus</span> to see friends and distant relatives there, I really spent my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> in 1933 into 19 -- I mean the end of '33, December -- from the end of '43 or beginning of '44, until the end of the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">In May of 1944, I was -- I fell ill with a strangulation hernia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">You may recall in the earlier part of the interview that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , I was already in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to be operated on in 1940, and that never came to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">But finally, with all my escapades and all that, the, the hernia just -- a hernia doesn't heal by itself, and the hand-made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truss</span> that I had just didn't do the job anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">So one day - one evening, walking through a <span class="DLF">park</span> on my way to actually an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> to deliver some documents or papers, I -- or a message -- I just was caught by one of these attacks and lay down on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">park bench</span> and started throwing up violently until there was nothing left but bile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">And it so happens that a woman walked by in a <span class="BUILDING">nurse's hospital</span> sister-type uniform, Red *> Woman of valor (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">Cross-type uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">And she came over and wanted to know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">Perhaps she thought I had been drinking.

And she tries to touch my stomach; there was this tenderness and the pain with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">She says, "This is an emergency!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">And she called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , and I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">And I cannot remember them actually taking my clothes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">That's how fast they put anesthesia on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">Already starting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">And then when I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">operating table</span> , I was sort of half away already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">And the next thing I knew was waking up the next morning in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">And a very nice, young religious sister -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span> by the name of Saint Joan of Arc -- bending over me and whispering in my ear after she had put a hot brick to my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">And I had a drain in my stomach, in my belly, because it had begun to almost, you know, to be infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">You know, there is the situation with the strangulation hernia creates these emergency conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">Whispering into my ear, "I am in charge of this ward, so therefore you have nothing to fear." </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">Later, when I needed my documents to make a claim with the German government for certain restitutions and disability-type compensation, I had to gather papers as to all these events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">So I wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to send me a copy of, of what I had undergone, what operation, just attesting to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">Well, in the letter I wrote to them, "And if Sister Joan of Arc is still with you, please tell her that I will never forget her kind words nor her cheerful whistle when she walked by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">She was always whistling a tune. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">A very young, attractive cheerful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">And they wrote back to me that she is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , did they write? </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">Or <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">And if the chance will present itself, they will send her my regards and tell her how I, how I remember her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">I wonder where she is today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">So there is a lot of reminiscences, and there are also nice bright moments in that period of darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1830">QUESTION:  Let's pull 1t back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">You were released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">I would like you to describe -- you went back to your Resistance work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">Can you describe in detail what 1t meant to have to take letters from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another? </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">What were the kinds of risks that you ran? </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">What kind of messages did you bring? </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Where did you travel, and who did you communicate with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1837">ANSWER:  I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on May the 8th, and I was released on the May 25th. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">That was just several days before the landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">The landing took place in June -- on June the 6th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">In my little diary that I also have, I wrote, sometime before my release from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , "I hope I will be released before the landing."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1841">QUESTION:  How did you know about the landing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1842">ANSWER:  Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through the Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of weeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a debarkation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">Where it would happen, we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">But we knew it was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">I did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of turmoil out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always my urge, to be part of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">So that between that time and the actual landing, there was very little time to do whatever we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">However, how did we feel, coming to your question about transporting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">First of all, we had to produce the cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">We made them with false stamps and seals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">And we, we were counterfeiters, you see! </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">That's what we were -- just like when I escaped from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a natural thing; because the urge was to be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">But at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">It's in hindsight, as you look: "What did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">My God, we were really young and...and dumb!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">That sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way endangering us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">You could go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> as a French citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">You could go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> to have a meal and the Milice’* would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">Well, if you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not involved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">So we were just part of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">But we did not consider our activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under that regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">Although we were exposed a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">We would have been exposed a little more to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean instant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1870">QUESTION:  What happened to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1871">ANSWER:  That was on the same day as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">I had been asked or instructed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> on that Saturday to deliver some cards, and he had been instructed to go into another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was a little further than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">The German Column advanced into that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">Eugene had de-- before he had delivered the cards had decided, "Let me go and visit my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">She lived there in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">He hadn't seen her in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">He's the fellow that boarded with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Sort of blondish red hair, curly-haired fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Eugene Bass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">He went on the nom de guerre, the war name, Bastinet -- B-A-S-T-I-N-E- ** Militia (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">T. He had gone to visit his mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">He arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> rather than go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> first to deliver the cards, which was a little further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">Got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , through the <span class="INT_SPACE">station lobby</span> , to the <span class="DLF">front door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And the advance column of Das Reich, the Germans, were there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">And everybody walking out was inspected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">And he had a rucksack; and in the rucksack, he had the ID cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">Shot in the head! </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">His name is listed in the book deportations under those summarily executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">Eugene Bass, his name is in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1891">QUESTION:  How did you find out what happened to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1892">ANSWER:  He didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">He did not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">So a few days later we contacted, a friend and I, his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">And she had found out from someone, some witness, that he had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that we were in on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">Because the advance unit had already been into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">And when we saw parallel to the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> the <span class="DLF">country road</span> where the German motorized the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that dust, so some of us decided, "If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do not want to go into the same direction." </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">So before we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> , there was another halt, another <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">There was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric commuter train</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">So the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">But the report on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> that got off that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> that particular morning was taken off and immediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">The men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">The women and the children were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">They were told they were being photographed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">They put bales of hay and straw around the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and put gasoline over it and destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , burned it down with the women and children in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">The moans and the cries filled the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">A couple of weeks later, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> to view the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">And we stood there crying, with the tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">Tables had been set up with the remains of mementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">But the original area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> 1s today still a <span class="BUILDING">shrine</span> to be visited, to reminisce and to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">We would have gone in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">The mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> at that time, on this particular moment, was arrested, put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">Reported right in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">The sons, before that happened to their father said, "Please, take us! </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">They cut off his legs, and they shot the sons, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">There was just a handful of people surviving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> out of 900-some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out without papers, that will never be known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">There were people hiding out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">A lot of Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">So that they should not be in hiding continually, and also be able to move a little freer, travel here or there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">But at that particular time, all that was already moot because the landing had taken place, a lot of what you might call, in the Genesis terms, "tohoo va-vohoo"”” happened -- a lot of tumult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1928">QUESTION:  Let's back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">I don't want to get to the tumult just yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">I would like to stay with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">Did you meet any of the survivors? </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">You had come so close, you were two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">You came after it had been burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">Did you meet anyone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1935">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">I had a call here when I wrote about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">I wrote a piece to the Sun paper, recalling the event of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">It was in 1984, 40 years after the event, and I had a lady call me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> who told me that at one time she and her family had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">And when she read this she had to get in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">But they had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had been devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">In fact, it was devastated in error. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">In the same <span class="REGION">area</span> , there are two little towns <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">One is called Oradour-sur-Glane, on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">River Glane</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">Another one, several miles away, not that great a distance, perhaps 15 kilometers or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">I don't quite have the distance in proportion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">That was called Oradour-sur-Vayres. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">Oradour- sur-Vayres had a group of Resistance fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">Oradour-sur-Glane had no Resistance fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">They had people in hiding, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">They had no arms caches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">Oradour-sur-Vayres did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">The German high command, going towards the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , the Division Das Reich -- and by the way, they did a lot of damage in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called Brive-la- Gaillarde, where they hung 90-some men from butcher hooks because of resistance activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">And their families had to walk, walk by to view that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">That is in the Department of Corréze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> was, and, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> was, in the Department of Haute-Vienne. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">The German Division Das Reich had been informed, by the Milice or by some of their collaborators, that Oradour-sur-Vayres had a Resistance group, an arms cache there, and that they might hinder their progress towards the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">The advance column of Das Reich went there to clean out that nest of resistors, so that the main columns would then have easy travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">But all they knew was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">They looked at the map, and they saw "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> " on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Angouléme</span> or wherever, and picked Oradour-sur- Glane. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">And the Mayor said, "We have no resistance here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">You can search the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">You can search everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">I give you my personal guarantee with my life." </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">And it was by mistake that Oradour-sur-Glane became the victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1965">QUESTION:  I want to take it back to events in which you were involved, okay, in which you know personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">Let's go back to D-Day, June 6, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">Where were you? *</span><span class="sentence" id="1968">° Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1969">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , doing my daily whatever it is, communication or whatever work I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">And it was a day of euphoria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">The papers reported it, and people were standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper buildings</span> to read the bulletins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">And the Germans were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">Chalus had already been liberated by the Resistance; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> not yet, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> had a main <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1974"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chalus</span> was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">I also have a little sheet here that shows the liberation of Chalus, and the appeal that was made by the, by the Resistance forces to keep calm and to go on about your daily lives as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">You see, there were two types of Resistance forces in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">One was the FTPF. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">This was called Franc-Tireurs Partisans Francaises.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">That was like a guerilla movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">And the other was called FFI, Force Francais de |'Interieur -- French Forces of the Interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">They were under the command of the exiled French government -- De Gaulle, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">And there was conflict between the two groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">The ones that listened to De Gaulle were the ones that went by the rules, when De Gaulle and the French exiled government would give instructions: "Do not attack such and such a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ..." Because that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> happened to be English property. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">So the FTPF would say: "Who cares? </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">But in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there 1s armament produced that goes to the Germans." </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">So there was this conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">The FTPF was also a more radical-type movement than the FFI. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">The FTPF, for instance, had some of the Spanish Civil War refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">They had a communist-leaning group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">They had more of the political activistic -- activist-type people who were fighting fascism wherever they can fight fascism, wherever they can find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">The FFI was picking their targets and was going by the -- what might be called "the rules." </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">But in a unruly times, rules sometimes don't achieve anything, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">So this was the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">But we were in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , hoping that soon we will have liberation established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">And it happened not too long afterwards, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1996">QUESTION:  Which of the two partisan groups were you allied with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1997">ANSWER:  The A.J. was independent, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">But we were under the orders of the FTPF. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">Yes, we were under the orders of the Franc-Tireurs Partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2000">QUESTION:  How were relations between the two groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2001">ANSWER:  They were very cordial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2002">QUESTION:  They were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2003">ANSWER:  It was a common cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">It is interesting that a common danger, how people's actions congeal, how a common danger becomes also a common denominator and an equalizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">I mean, you take the London Blitz, just to divert for a minute -- °° Free-Shooting French Partisans (French).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2006">QUESTION:  Let's not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2007">ANSWER:  Ok.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2008">QUESTION:  I really don't want to get into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">Can we pull it back? </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">Was there any feeling of antisemitism? </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">Did the A.J. feel as if the FTPF looked down on them or treated them less well because it was a Jewish group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2012">ANSWER:  I would never dismiss that aspect of a, of a, of a situation where Jews are involved, because our history tells us that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">On the surface, it did not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">We did not feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">We did not see it in so many deeds or words. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">But it could very well have been there, because there was one captain of the French army who worked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">He was a Viennese, actually of Polish origin, but coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">His name was Prinz. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">And he was originally with the French Foreign Legion, then came into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to join the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">And he at one time indicated to me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis, if he survives the war he will have to settle a few accounts with some people, that he knew among his unit, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">And after the liberation, when the German soldiers had been arrested and interned and were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , he took me to one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to see because he was in charge of some of their units. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">And he took me in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and he -- I got great satisfaction to see this little fellow by the name of Prinz -- he was about 5 foot 4 -- had these tall German prisoner soldiers stand at attention and act like really like scared children once they were in custody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">Just weeks before, days before, they were the strong, the strong masters, especially women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">And then when the day of reckoning came, they became whimpering children themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">But, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">We, during our work with the Resistance, did not see it openly, feel 1t openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">And frankly, for that nonsense, during this particular period there was no time for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">We had an enemy to fight, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2029">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">The landing, June sixth, and the aftermath. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">How did you help, if you did help, the invading American forces? </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">Was your group involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2034">ANSWER:  We were involved tn -- our group was involved a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">A little later, with grave research and registration; because there had been -- for instance, we received parachuted provisions that came into the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">Certain nights when, when the message, the message, the coded message would tell us to be at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> at a certain time, and then there would be... We were told to send a flare at a certain time, up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , and then few minutes later we would have a drop off of clothing or food items. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">The parachutes themselves would be gathered up, and the ladies would make shirts out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">They were in khaki or white or pink. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">And in the process, in that execution of that particular parachuting help to the Resistance, some were shot down, some had to bail out for one reason or another, some were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">And then later on, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> a little north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , there was, of course, there was the region of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cognac</span> , and towards the <span class="DLF">coast</span> there were evidently fatalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">After the landing in later weeks, some of our groups and us, we were involved in researching -- traveling and researching with farmers and with the countryside people who might have found soldiers, American, Canadian or British soldiers, also some of the Polish-exile forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">We helped in grave research. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">It was grave registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">That's what we did, we helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">Later, there were some USO” halls were established, which we helped out with. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">But right after the landing and when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> was liberated, a committee was formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">It was called COJDASOR -- Comité Juif d'Assistance Social et Reconstruction -- the Jewish Committee for Social Assistance and Reconstruction.”* </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">This was mainly geared to help refugees -- people who had lived in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and hidden out, and could not do any kind of work during that period and really were penniless, to, to put them on their feet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">OSE was one of the organizations connected with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">The Organization for Secours aux Enfants.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">A children's organization, OSE. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">You are familiar with that, and some of those Zionist organizations were involved, like WIZO~’ and Hadassah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">And this whole program, that whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">So we had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> at 15 Avenue du Midi, and some of us, from our group working previously with the underground with the false ID papers, became employed by that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">And as later, after liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , which was in August of '44, and later the victory when people came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , again this Committee did a good job of, number one, helping them to get over the first hump, and later to establish themselves with a <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">Even helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the Red Cross and other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to just see who had survived and who can be reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">And all these communication means were used to, whether it was by telegraph or radio or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">But the COJDASOR was that committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">But between the landing and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Because, because <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">And the rest took place in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in August of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">And had one major scare 1n the winter of '44, when after the Battle of the Bulge the Germans actually advanced far enough to pose a renewed threat to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">But that -- again, time took care of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2064">QUESTION:  But you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">Can you describe the day of liberation? *’ </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">United Service Organization *> The actual name was: Comité Juif d'Action Social et de Reconstruction; Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction (French). *’ </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">The name of the organization is Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (French), and is referred to as the Children’s Rescue Network in English. ** </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">Women’s International Zionist Organization
ANSWER:  As I said before, it was almost an unbelievable feeling to know that the day has finally come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2069">QUESTION:  Not D-Day, June sixth, but the liberation itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> was freed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2071">ANSWER:  Oh, the liberation, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> was freed, was just another normal day, except seeing Germans patrolling the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and Gestapo patrolling the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and being in charge here and being in charge there, you saw columns of Gestapo and Germans being led down the <span class="DLF">street</span> by Resistance fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">The great victorious German army led down the <span class="DLF">street</span> by young people in rag tag outfits. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">That was the...that was the impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">Just a few weeks earlier, I was in a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and saw a column...a unit of German soldiers, waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that they were taking to some direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">They were sitting on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , on their rucksacks, on their equipment, with their guns standing up, leaning against each other, bayonets drawn, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">They have this triangular thing, arrangement there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">One of the soldiers was opening up -- cutting open a can of sardines with his bayonet. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">Trying to open it up; and then he ate the sardines out of his -- out of the can, swallowing them all in all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">And in his language, I recognized he must have been either an Austrian or a Bavarian, because having been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I knew what the Austrian accent was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">And he said, in German -- which I will not tell you in German, but I will tell you that in the English translation, "The people that are walking by here," he says, "those French people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">They will look at us and will say to themselves, ‘Schon schaut Sie aus, diese Reichsdeutsche Armee!'"”’--"She sure looks good, that victorious German army!" </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">In a facetious way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">And when we saw those German prisoners walking down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of -- with their arms raised on top of their heads, disarmed...that came to my mind. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2085">You look good, you victorious German Army! </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">Now that you are guarded by a rag tag outfit, you act like you are the victims." </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">That was the main impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">And that picture, that -- imagine that scene repeated itself over and over in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in all the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that became liberated, one by one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">The collaborators were arrested, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">Unfortunately, there was also during that period a lot of spur of the moment, perhaps hasty, emotional reaction to those that we, the underground had perceived as being collaborators, like selling, dealing <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , or cohorting or fraternizing with some of the German officers -- including some of the people that we had known, our own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">And it was not uncommon for someone whom we knew who did <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , even if they were Jewish, to be executed actually without trial, without jury, without due process. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">But the emotions were so high that these things happened 1n I wouldn't just say a few cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">There were quite -- there were many.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2095">QUESTION:  Leo, we have five minutes left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">I think 1t makes sense to wrap it up in this hour rather than go to another tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">Tell me what, very briefly, I want to save a few minutes for pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">But tell *! “</span><span class="sentence" id="2099">She looks beautiful, that German Army” (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">me, after the war, you were involved in this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">How did you get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2102">ANSWER:  I had an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , who already in 1941 had sent me papers to...the affidavit to join her here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">But with the advent of the Pearl Harbor and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> entering the war, those documents expired, fell by the wayside. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">In 1946, I received new papers, new affidavits, from my aunt here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">I applied for the night to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I joined here my aunt here in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">I have a sheet here that shows that I was on a preferential quota -- I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">And also, one that my travel to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is in the national interest of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , simply because I worked for that group that did grave registration and I was also involved in the postal censor, postal censor service in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> later, under the guidance of a army lieutenant, Sonja Beaumont. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">A lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">I was with the postal censor service for a little while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">I spoke several languages, and so I was a few months there in that capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">So I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2112">QUESTION:  And you married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2113">ANSWER:  I married in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">Married an American young woman in 1952, and we have three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">And in January of this year, we became grandparents for the first time, and that is the -- that's good ending to the story.</span></p>
