<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on the 28th of April 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Could you tell us a little bit about what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> was like, your childhood was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well, I was part of the working class community. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My dad was a machinist on the <span class="DLF">Erie Railroad</span> , and we lived through the Depression, which was sort of harrowing at times, especially one Christmas Eve when my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said he was laid off, and then that he was out of work about six months, and then he got back to work again; things improved from that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So I was a Depression child. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We didn't know we were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , walked, oh, eight-tenths of a mile I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I was a kindergartner. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And then went through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Obviously, for my size, I played basketball, but it was a small <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">There were only 44 of us in the graduating class. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I married a girl from the graduating class, back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I've known her since we were in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> I guess, and -- but we didn't date until going to the senior prom together. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">By that time Pearl Harbor had happened, and everybody was going off to war or working in the war industries. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I decided I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , although, I'd been the first one in our family to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> even. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My two older sisters, they are 10, 14 years older than I am, they left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as sophomores to help support the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and that was all the help they could give me for going away to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I went to the state teacher's college at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brockport</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had enlisted in the â€” enlisted Reserve Corp in July of '42, and was called to active duty then in April of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">This enough background of growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  No, that's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  In '42, after enlisting, can you tell us briefly what led up to your activity in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves, and they had permitted me to start <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Then in April '43 I went on active duty, went through processing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Agra</span> , and then ended up in basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp McQuaide</span> in the Coast Guard Artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I applied for a -- OCS, the <span class="BUILDING">Boston candidate school</span> to get a commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My battery commander recommended that we take our applications back and apply for an army specialized training program, ASTP, which promised us 18 months of college training, and then officers candidate school training. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That sounded awfully good to me, and I said okay, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Stanford University</span> for processing, and then to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Oregon</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eugene</span> , <span class="REGION">Oregon</span> , to study engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This was the most intense academic work I had ever gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Tremendous number of courses that we had to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We had supervised study every evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We started at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and had a schedule back then until 10:00 o'clock at night; and then lights were out at 10:30, so we didn't have much free time. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Then in April of '43, this program closed down because of the anticipation of the invasion of Europe, and these troops were really in a holding pattern, we now realized, and we went to fill up the vacancies in the 11th Armored Division, and I became a -- well, I went to the 22nd Tank Battalion Company, AV, for medium <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an assistant driver on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Sherman tank</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">medium tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they gave us, oh, several review of basic training, taught us how to drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and how to shoot a 75-millimeter gun from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and while we're doing things, basic survival, but we got the division -- well, the division was getting ready to ship overseas then, in August, and we moved from <span class="REGION">California</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Cooke</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> to the <span class="REGION">East Coast</span> , and I think that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and went to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> one night, the SS Samaria, and half of the division was on it, about 5,000 men, and they congratulated us, that it was only single loaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">By that they meant that we didn't have to share our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Because in double loaded you have one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> for two people, and we were able to sleep for eight hours and the other guy would sleep for eight hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I shouldn't say <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was actually -- they were hammocks that were strung across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room tables</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back table</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a very, very quiet crossing, but we had British food, and the British didn't make any friends among these American troops with the kind of food they gave us and the service we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were very unhappy with the Brits on this score. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I don't know if any of the other guys told you about it, but we had close to food riots on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We did see -- we were called to the general <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> several times, and we did see some action of death charges being dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , and-- so I presume that they had some alerts that there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">u-boats</span> stalking or trying to attack the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , and much to our surprise saw the headlines of the newspaper saying the SS Samaria had been sunk, and we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and we were glad the news headline wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Then they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and took us to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warminister</span> where we drew <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and had to clean up the equipment, because these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> had been stored, a lot of Cosmoline, it's heavy grease on all <span class="NPIP">parts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It's quite a chore cleaning it up and getting them in working condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then we had to check out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , drive them enough to road test them and get a few miles on them so we were confident that they weren't going to breakdown when we needed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And then on about the 16th or 17th of December -- I'm skipping over. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We had a few trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and I did get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in what they called a <span class="DLF">buzz bomb alley</span> where there was a lot of damage, and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> one night, and when some buzz bombs came in, we could hear the explosions and see the flashes, and the anti-aircraft was going off. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during some of the attacks, we were getting a poor taste of what the war was going to be like. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">On the 16th or 17th of December we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wayland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and boarded an LST. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing ship tank</span> that were under the auspices of the U.S. Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And we really envied the navy guys because they had clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> with sheets, <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and a good <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> , good food, and a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy for that short cross of the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , which was just overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span> , and then unloading the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> had an accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We were the number three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> being loaded, and so we're almost the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> to unload. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">While the LST had a basketball backboard â€” so when they didn't -- weren't carrying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , the crew could shoot baskets or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Anyhow, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was under it, and the motion of unloading the tanks, the backboard had dropped loose, and it swung down. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Well, our gunner reached up to move that so the hatch of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> wouldn't hit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Our tank commander was down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> directing our driver to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> off the LST. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Well, just as our gunner, Edmonton -- and most of these guys I refer to them by their last name â€” had reached out to lift this up. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Martiburg [ph] gave Trevy [ph] the signal to move out, and he did, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> caught his hand between this backboard and the chariot top. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he crushed two or three fingers, and part of his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Well, this was a real medical emergency, and nobody's around to help, so we bypass the column, and delivered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We picked up a motorcycle escort and drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span> , and had -- the motorcycle MP didn't realize the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> could go that fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We had <span class="DLF">steel tracks</span> , and this was December, so it was cold weather, and they were cobblestone <span class="DLF">streets</span> with <span class="DLF">streetcar tracks</span> on them, and we were skidding and swerving. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">In fact, we made about two turns where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> went -- spint 360 degrees around before we changed directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And, in fact, we almost ran over another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The M-view was directing traffic, and he let the -- our escort come through, and he put up his hand for us to stop, and we weren't stopping, and he scrambled to get out of the way, and then we had two motorcycle escorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Well, we got to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and I had the distinction of being -- delivering the first patient ever by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I actually carried <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was a small slight man, older than the rest of us, he was in our mid to late 30's, and we didn't see him until the war was over, and heard that he had lost two fingers and part of the palm of his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Then we got back to the company, and loaded up with gas and ammunition, because at this point we didn't know that there was a battle in the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We were originally scheduled to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> and help -- well, sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had been bypassed, and this was sort of our introduction to combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We weren't going to go in and capture them, but we weren't going to let them come out either. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They had live ammunition, we had live ammunition, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make sure that they didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">That was the original plans that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Well, they changed that when the Battle of the Bulge started, and they gave orders to our division to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span> directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">This was a -- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We drove until we ran out of gas, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came by, handed up a gas can, we loaded up and kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> -- oh, this must have been about the 24th -- 23rd, 24th. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I want to say it was the 24th of December, Christmas Eve. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Now the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> knew about the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They knew the German breakthrough, and we were being inundated with propaganda, that the Germans were going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> by Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, the American Armored Division is a pretty impressive show of force to drive through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were out on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , there were eight and ten <span class="DLF">gates</span> , they were trying to climb up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> giving us eggs and flowers and fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everything we wanted, but our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I remember driving up to the Arc of Triumph and making a sharp left turn, and drove on through to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And all the time it was just hurry, keep going, keep going. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanson</span> they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and I shouldn't use that word "break," because we had to work awfully hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We had to break -- take the track apart, and take the connectors that linked each section of track. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">These come off as a big one-inch nut on it, and you have to take that apart, take that off, then with a sledgehammer knock the connector off. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And then we put on a new connector or an extender. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We call them duckbills, which would extend the width of the track about four to five inches. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And, again, these have to be put on with a sledgehammer, and then the nuts put back on and tightened up, and it was not easy work; heavy physical work, as well as track -- threading that track up over the drive wheels and sprockets of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They had promised us a turkey dinner for Christmas day, and they delivered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We got turkey, but that was all we got, turkey and bread; no fixings, but we had turkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Well, at this point they discovered that our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , this is <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank A3</span> , had a bad transmission and so the rest of the division went on, and we stayed with ordinance while they repaired and eventually they replaced the transmission, and then they decided it was an engine problem; they replaced the engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So the division went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span> and through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> , and got into action very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was behind, so we missed the first day â€” first several days of action. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">In fact, when we got up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span> , they held us there until -- they thought the division was coming off the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and they didn't, so we were several days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We didn't know where we were going to, just stayed put. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I had some interesting stories as we were traveling by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I remember, this was now snow and ice, and I remember one little French boy, I would guess must have been seven or eight years old, about that high, came by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He looked cold and miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We stopped, and put some wool socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some candy bars, and muffled him up as best as we could, but we had to go, but he did look like a very forlorn waif by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Then as we were driving beyond here, now we're in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in that <span class="DLF">line</span> there, a one-lane road, and it had sort of a crown on it to help drainage, but it was all ice and snow, and it was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This was very tricky driving, because if we kept the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> balanced on the top of the crown, we made good progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">If it was off balance, we'd slide down to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> until we hit the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and got some soft dirt, and then the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> would dig in and bring us up on top of the thing, but usually we'd go up too far and then we'd slide down the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So we were going down the <span class="DLF">road</span> like this, up one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , down the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">This was all right until we noticed that along both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span> there were these large <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and they were, oh, at least that big around. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">These <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were all notched, and they had little white boxes all wired around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we discovered later that these were boxes of TNT, and that was primer cord, and this whole <span class="DLF">road</span> had been mined like that in case the Germans did break through from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They would have blown all these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and it would have been like jackstraws across that <span class="DLF">road</span> , and they would have been denied to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">This concerned me driving down that <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">First of all, we didn't -- we could see probably blowing that <span class="DLF">road</span> while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">All we could see is bumping into something and setting the whole thing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that was a harrowing experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Then we caught up with the division, and as I said, we waited, and then we were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Longchamps</span> which 1s, oh, two or three kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> , in and around that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we -- our company became part of CCR. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The 11th Armored Division was divide -- made up of three combat commands. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Combat command CCA or CCB or CCR. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And there could be any combination of battalions or companies in either one depending on the mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well, the mission of Combat Command Ark, CCR, was to support whichever -- A or B -- had the main action; in case of any difficulty, we'd back them up, in case they broke through, then we were to go through the break and exploit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So we were always moving here and there depending on what the action was. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Sometimes we'd move three or four times during a night, maybe -- frequently, more than that, almost like a chess game, to get in position where we expected the German thrust to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I remember painting our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> white, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly see them with all that snow around, and it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Getting up in the morning, I'd take half three-quarters of an inch of gauze across the inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There's no heaters in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and we'd just be sitting there, and as long as one man was on the radio, the rest of us could sleep, so we'd take turns doing that, but it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And sometimes we'd be in position. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I remember one -- this little valley where the forward slope of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , and on the other side of the knoll was our German column. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">This morning at dawn, bright and clear, blue sky, it was beautiful, and our friends in the 19th ?</span><span class="sentence" id="131">Akal? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Air Command came over with their P-47s, and attacked this German column. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Now, the column was out of sight, it was on the other side of this <span class="DLF">hill</span> , but we could see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns going, we could see them drop bombs, and it actually disappeared around the crest of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And after, oh, a half hour or so we got orders to move, that we were no longer needed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Air Force had taken care of the threat, so we moved to another <span class="NPIP">position</span> , but that was a lot of the kinds of activity we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Do you remember any underground resistance as you were going from action to action?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  No, we didn't run into underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We were very sympathetic to the Belgiums. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I remember we would come across some of the <span class="BUILDING">Belgium homes</span> that had been overrun by the Germans, and I remember one little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> we came into, and there was an elderly woman, I'd say an old woman, maybe in her 80's. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">She was still laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She had a bullet hole in her head, and we had no need for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Of course, there were all sorts of dead animals around, but when it was cold, that didn't bother us. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When it thawed that became a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We were into the Bulge and had heard about the massacre of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , and that was in the northern section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulge</span> , and the 11th was not involved in that, but that went through that the whole American army I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The Germans were not nice, and we weren't going to take any prisoners either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  How many people were killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Oh, the massacre of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , about 160 I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">These were American solders that had been captured by the Germans and they were machine gunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So the 11" decided not to take any prisoners for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And, in fact, General Patton had come down to division headquarters, which is quite a way downs by the chain of command, to give direct orders to our division and commander that we were to take prisoners, and -- but we established our reputation then, and, so, we didn't wear patches, so -- we didn't want to be captured by the Germans; they didn't like us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Patches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Shoulder patches showing that we were members of the 11th Armored Division, a triangular patch that's red, yellow and blue with the 11th on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And so we fought through the Bulge, and that was a big battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I understand that there were about 80,000 American casualties, and a 100,000 German casualties in about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So it was a lot of very serious fighting, and small action is big action, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We helped in the pinching off of the Bulge, drawing up with the First Army, part of the 41% Calvary, and Major Greene, or General Greene now, led that group to do that, and that was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houffalize</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And then from that point on we started pushing the Germans back, and we moved in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxemburg</span> to bridge the sick-pick line, and we finally broke through at Prim or Prim, I guess it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And at the time sat at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Prum River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And from that point then we made a dash to the <span class="DLF">line</span> getting near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coblenz</span> , took a breather there â€” a breather, a couple of days -- and then they started moving us upstream of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , so I guess we'd be moving east, and closed off the Saar-Moselle Triangle. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That took a large amount of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I remember that kind of action, because at night we could see German search lights on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> forming a huge "v". </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So the German troops -- because they were disorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">There were individuals of small units, you know, with nowhere to go to get across. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Of course, we were killing them off, and taking them prisoners, and sending them back making sure they didn't get across. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We got to the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and we crossed at --near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span> on a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> , and much to our surprise there was the Navy in their Navy uniforms with their white sailor caps manning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pontoon rig</span> , which was with smoke pots all around so we couldn't -- but nobody could see it, but driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> across that was -- across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> on a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> was sort of disconcerting shall we say? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Everybody had their hatches open. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We're standing with their heads out in case that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> went down, that we'd have somewhat of a chance to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We crossed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we started driving through <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> , heading toward -- well, it was actually <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> now, and captured an arms plant -- a <span class="BUILDING">Walther arms plant</span> at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zella-Mehlis</span> , and we're into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and we were the first American troops to cross the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> , but we were pulled back and told that the Russians were supposed to have our case in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we went south along the Czech<span class="DLF">/German border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  What is this timeframe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Timeframe, March/April of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We were moving very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">One time we -- the Germans let us go through, and then they cut off our supplies, so we had to -- I think that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kombach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Don't quote me on that name, but we were cut off there, and we had to send our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">light tanks</span> back to fight the way through the Germans in order to get supplies and bring supplies up so we could keep moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And we've heard that they'd give us maps expecting us to cover the 20 miles in two or three days, and we'd do that in a half a day, and we have to wait for maps so we can go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Of course, the Germans were very disorganized at this point, and when they did resist, it was sort of a last ditch stand, but we were moving very fast, and the Armored Division just -- with CCA and CCB, they just use a pincers movement, and cut them off, and we'd just keep going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  At this point the war was turning back clearly _?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes, a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Again, in the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , we didn't know what was happening elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We were â€” We didn't have radios or news broadcasts, we did get newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Every day was another day at combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We're just pressing on. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">A lot of my impressions are, you know, hindsight. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The day-to-day activities were just to keep that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> going, and drive until we hit resistance, and then we deploy to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So I remember one time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Briod</span> , it was the first -- only time we had to dismount from our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and fight on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">This was - This is scary for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanker</span> feels very comfortable with that steel around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there with British pilots there, and we couldn't get to it because <span class="DLF">bridges</span> had been blown up, and we had to go across the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and then deploy to take them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The Germans who were guarding the Brits were very happy to surrender, so they -- there was no resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But at the time they told us to dismount, we didn't know what we were going to run into, and you never do, but we were able to cap -- to relieve the -- liberate these British flyers, and turn the German prisoners we had over to them, and they took care of it, and --
QUESTION:  What happened as your division approached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , or how many _ +?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  We captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , and we were the first troops into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , and actually had heavier fighting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> then we had since the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The others had been rather sporadic. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we took a lot of casualties going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">To give you a little bit of a feel of this, I remember going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> that was in a cut that was down, oh, I'd say, four feet below the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The <span class="DLF">road</span> was next to it, and then there's a mountainside going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Only room for one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> couldn't pass each other on this <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Coming up the <span class="DLF">mountain road</span> , around a bend, where a group of about, oh, 15 to 20 kids on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They were the Hitler young. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They were in military uniform, and strapped to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> was a Panzerfaust, an anti-tank weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It looked like a football at the end of a hockey stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They were coming, and we were going down, and we weren't going to let them get close, so -- and a kid on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> is -- and I say a kid, these were 12, 13, 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And we had to open up with machines guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It wasn't pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Some of them tried to climb the mountain side, they couldn't do that, and they couldn't drop down to the railroad cut, we'd just drove right through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That was going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> we kept going, and finally met the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now, this beyond <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">At this point we had a company, 22nd Tactic, part of CCA, Combat Command Day, and we were one of the lead companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So we had bypassed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Other units of the 11" found <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We started getting rumors from our guys, the cooks and bakers who were going back for supplies, that they had found a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And some of the rumors we heard were that there were bodies stuffed down <span class="DLF">wells</span> , that there were bodies stacked as cord wood all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They even said that they had found some lampshades made out of human skin that had tattoos on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">This came at the time when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Now, the deal with the Russians were that there would be a ten mile buffer zone from the Russians and the American Army, and they were between the Germans that were trying to surrender, and they were desperately trying to surrender to the Americans rather than the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And at this point a large number of the 12â€œ SS Panzer Group surrendered to our <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We were to -- they were supposed to surrender to the Russians but didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We finally took them under control, and our control was just an open <span class="DLF">field</span> , and we mark it off with <span class="DLF">telephone wire</span> , just strung telephone wire about two or three strands of it on pipes or posts stuck in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was a stream flowing through the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I don't know how many thousand troops and Germans were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We had set up our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> at about a hundred foot intervals, and we just rounded the machine gun between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And we weren't going to let any Germans get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We weren't very careful about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">If we saw any movement, a machine gun would go off. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We didn't care if 1t sprayed through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Some of our guys saw some Germans trying to swim in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> , and, again, we machine gunned them, and let fly a whole round of ammunition just to make sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We didn't have facilities to feed them, so periodically, like every other day or so, we'd shoot a horse and drag it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and it was up to them to butcher it and how to distribute the meat however they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That was about the only food we could give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">This was going on while <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was being cleaned up and made, quote, Suitable for human habitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">In other words, other members -- parts of our Division were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> taking care of the sick, burying the dead, and because -- there's talk â€” finding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a surprise to the Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We weren't prepared for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We didn't know they existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We had no idea of the extent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We didn't have food, we didn't have medics to help the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Some of the people died just running to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and half tracks. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Emotionally, they were drained, but physically they were kind of a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The food we had wasn't appropriate for a person who was -- had been on a starvation diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And they started eating food too fast, and this didn't agree with their stomachs, and so they would get even sticker, and many of them died. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was a very sad thing, but we didn't know, because the medics could have been backing us up, but we were so far ahead- actually, the 11th, when the war was over, we were the furthest east of any American troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We were way east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Most people don't realize that the Third Army had gotten that far east. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And our <span class="DLF">lines</span> were awfully far extended. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And it was a difficult thing for them to bring the resources up to take care of these people, and, fortunately, we were able to save off many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  When your division first went in -- I realize you weren't there, so -- but other members were, what happened to the SS who were the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Do you know whatever happened to the upper echelon the day in Europe under your supervision --
ANSWER:  What I've heard was that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> got close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the Germans ran, they left, and I don't know if they were captured or if they were able to hide themselves or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The -- I'm sure the reaction of the guys was that, if there was no resistance, we had to do something with these sick and dying people. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You know, thousands of people that are dying, some dying as you're looking at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was something that nobody was prepared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I'm sure that we weren't -- the guys weren't concerned about the guards that had run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But I know in other -- let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">What was the name of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Well, we hit a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that had a lot of forced labor, slave labor, mainly French and Dutch people. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">When we liberated that, the French and the Dutch took care of their guards very quickly, and not very humanly; they just beat them up, and beat them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I imagine if there were any survivors over at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , were in physical condition, they got their hands on the guards at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They were treated the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Do you if there were men and women who were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  There were men and women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I've been back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- I went back there about five years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was made up mainly of East Europeans, many Poles, Latvians, Estonians, Bulgarian, there were even a few Americans, 2- or 300 Americans in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="264">There were predominantly Jewish, but there were other people there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They were, I guess, masons and catholics and the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So there were all sorts of people in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We could see the <span class="DLF">grave sites</span> , <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> in the film that some of the guys in the division took. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We used our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> to dig out the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , but the Germans in the local community -- I guess this was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , I should say <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , it's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norwood</span> really -- denied knowing anything about this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That is hard to believe because of the stench that was coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="272">You could smell it for miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And the sight, you might imagine, but the smell no one can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Well, we got the local people to help bury, and so we made them place each body in the <span class="DLF">trench</span> as gently as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We filled the <span class="DLF">trench</span> , and then had them put dirt over them with shovels, but once there was covering of dirt, then we used a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> to put more dirt over them, and then put another layer of bodies in. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The danger from disease was so great we had to get these bodies -- there's thousands of them â€” into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and we had to get them buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  How close was the closest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You said you could smell this for miles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> overlooks the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I would guess the distance from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was maybe three kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Not very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That's why it stretches the imagination that they wouldn't know what was happening there, because the shift of the wind, they'd know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  What was the town peoples' response when your division had come in and then realized that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was being liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Did they have a response to the people who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Remember, we had bypassed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The people lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming village</span> , and everybody there denied being Nazi, denied knowing anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="288">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was pretty remote from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We were about 20 or 30 miles from them by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And they didn't have good communication, just a -- had to take a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So -- and that's -- Afterwards, they started taking tours of the guys through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and then shortly after that, in July, the Division was disbanded, and we were preparing to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to fight over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  So members of the Division were brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">When people grew up as prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Where were they --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This was in the period when they were trying to, not only bring up our medical staff and supplies, but just even while the burial details were in progress so that the guys in the Division could see what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And this sort of reinforces what we've been fighting for, although, we didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">From Battle of the Bulge on, we were fighting most of the troops of a -- Panzer groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Now the Panzer group was made up of several pounds or division, so it was a large -- almost a corps type thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But we -- The people in these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , they said they didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I suspect they were telling the truth, but the people close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> had to know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  What happened to the people that -- your part of the division regarding the Panzer groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was cleared of the survivors, and the dead had been buried, our prisoners were transported back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , and they were incarcerated in those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> until they were later exchanged probably to the Russians, because they were supposed to be turned over to the Russians anyway, and I suspect the Russians kept them for X number of years at forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don't have -- that's a rumor I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  So thousands of people in the Panzer group that you had to guard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Yep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  And then they were moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Uh-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  How did your detail wind up from that part of the war, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  See, the war was over shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And, in fact, the day we got the word that the war was over, there was a lot of celebration, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And we got word about 10:00 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And there was a lot of celebrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And then about 11:00 o'clock at night we get an urgent message to mount our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and move out, that 52 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German Tiger Tanks</span> were going to break through to a readout area in their <span class="DLF">purchase garden</span> , somewhere in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And, so, we had to move from this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we were in to head the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> off. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German Tiger Tank</span> is a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and greatly outguns, and there's much more armor than <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American Sherman Tank</span> ; they had 88-millimeter cannon, and we had a 76-millimeter. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And kind of against Tiger, is not what we really like to do, but we had to drive through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to head these guys off, but we had drunken drivers taking us there, and it was a blackout drive, so it was rather hazardous to your health just to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But we got to where we were supposed to be, and the Germans didn't show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was a trick or a rumor, that there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tiger Tanks</span> coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But that was really the last incident of the war, as far as I remember, other than going on guard duty in Star and Read, and eventually up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> to supervise the destruction of German ammunition by German POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And then I was able to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and didn't really-- end of December of '45, and was actually discharged from the Army in January of '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">victory ship</span> , the Norway Victory, and it was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , today's standards, and we had a tremendous gale in the <span class="REGION">north Atlantic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Instead of taking seven days to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , it took us eleven. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I was seasick ten-and-a-half of those 11 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It literally -- the waves were 60 to a hundred feet high. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I mean, you'd look up, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was down here, and all you saw was water way up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But we did get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> safely, and then we were discharged, and I used the GI bill to pick up a civilian life, and it was a typical young man ina hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I used the GI bill to get three degrees, and I -- including a master's and a doctorate, a Ph.D. from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> in 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So -- and then I went into community college work, and became the founding president of three community colleges in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So I had a whole professional career. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But then 1976 -- oh, I had - when I got my Ph.D. in '50, <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was breaking out, and in '52 it looked like <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was going to become World War III, and I could see myself going back into service as a tank crewman, PFC type. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And so with a hot Ph.D. in my pocket, I went to various services to see if I could get a direct commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I went to the Army, and they said, We'd make you a second lieutenant in the quartermaster corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I went to the Navy, and they said, we have no use for Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="334">D.s. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Went to the Army -- or the Air Force rather, and they said, We'd make you a first lieutenant as a human resources research specialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I figured, with a title like that, 1t would take me -- well, it took me about 20 seconds to accept the Reserve commission with the Air Force, and I stayed active in the Air Force Reserves. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And in '76 went back in active duty with the Air Force at the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I was a full colonel at this point, and became the director of post-secretary education for the Secretary of Defense, and helped with the establishment -- or rather with the degree granting authority that the community college of the Air Force had. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So I was still in the community college work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  We're running out of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , were you able to take a tour through at the time --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  -- after part of your division -- liberating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and cleaned part of it, you said other parts of your troop has passed through. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Had you gone through --
ANSWER:  I wasn't part of that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I had gone back, as I said, five years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">That would have been '85, maybe '86. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Most of my reactions are from the film that Ray Bush had taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  Can tell me a little bit about how that came about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Well, Ray was with the '56 engineers, and he had a small eight-millimeter camerA: And we were all told not to have that, cameras or keep diaries or take pictures of anything, but that didn't stop most of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And he was taking pictures of combat from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> right in through the Bulge on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And he would send those <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Some of them were x-rayed, unfortunately, but he put them all together in this -- two reels of film, and he showed them to us at the division reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And the offhand, if I wanted a copy of it, he'd be glad to do it, and I took him up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I had a copy made, or he had copy made, I paid for it, but whatever, and it was fortunate I did, because his copy was destroyed when a fire went through his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So mine was the only surviving copy, and that's why I thought, rather than take a chance on it, because it is rather historic evidence that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> should be -- would be the place to deposit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  And the film was taken as --
ANSWER:  It took as day-to-day activities would provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I know one section of the film, there was a section of the 22nd Tank Battalion moving, and I think he got my picture, but I was all buttoned up inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He got a picture of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  And it showed the prisoners that survived as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It was showing them in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in various stages of emaciation. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It showed them unloading the dead in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , showed them placing them in the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> , showed them covering the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and even took a view from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> over to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> where you could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  And in your experiences of the war, was this something that was totally unexpected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We were fighting the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We were soldiers fighting soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We didn't â€” nothing prepared us for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Nobody told us that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I don't think anybody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We didn't expect anything when we overran <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It just sort of reinforced the -- our feeling that we were fighting a just war, that whatever happened, it was right that we should be in the war, that we were the good guys, white hats, even though there are times during combat when we weren't nice guys, but combat is like that, you fight to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Thank you very much.</span></p>
