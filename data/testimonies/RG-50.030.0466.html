<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  They were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">There were 10 children and my grandfather had the <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> , <span class="BUILDING">tailoring shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And there hardly was any food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and my mother was the second oldest girl, the first one was a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So my mother had to raise all the younger children, so she never had a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">She said she never played with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They had the cradle made out of wood and she would look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And children bear on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> playing hopscotch, and she participated then, she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs and many times the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cradle</span> was turned upside down because she got so excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But she never had time to really play with children, raising the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My grandfather, I only saw him once or twice in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">To me he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But the grandchildren he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That one time we went to visit I was on his lap and I braided his beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And my mother just stood there, she didn’t believe that he let me do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Was your family very religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My dad was clean-shaven and my mother did not wear a wig. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They were modern Orthodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">When my dad worked -- well, the name was [indecipherable], he never had a vacation all his life because he didn’t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So this was taken off as vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So my mother used to take us <span class="NPIP">places</span> , or also we children always -- every summer you had to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like, otherwise you would die, it seems like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The New Yorkers do that too, don’t they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  And well, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we used to go to, and also I was very athletic and on weekends we used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And then I also belonged to the Mizrachi, which is a Orthodox Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I think I was about five or six when I joined, and we had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for about two weeks, and then we had conclaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  And you ha-had one sibling, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My brother, who is four years older, and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My mother always said she only wanted two children, she raised such a large family before that that’s all she wanted, and that’s all she had was two children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  When was your brother born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  June -- wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">June the second, because my son was born June the fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">June the second, 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Were you close with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">A girl just had to smile and look pretty, that’s all that mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And my brother had to be educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So he didn’t have a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My dad wanted him to be a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Is that all right, the way I’m holding it now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So he was educated for both. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So I was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- we had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from eight til 12, and you went back in the afternoon from two til four or from eight til one and three til five. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Whenever he got out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So he didn’t have much of a childhood either, in the -- it was really interesting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married, and so we talked about our parents and about our childhood and the interesting part was, the way I talked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our parents, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So he told me, he said, “I was so jealous of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I said, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I said, “I was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And he said, “I had to be, I had to study all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I had no childhood, and you had friends.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He didn’t have any friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And it was really interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We were jealous of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  But it worked out well, I mean, we got it out of our system and we didn’t carry any grudges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So do -- your parents didn’t -- weren’t particularly interested in -- in your education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I was not a dumbbell. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I didn’t have to work very hard, and I brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> A’s and B’s without any sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he had to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> A’s, B’s were not good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And well, that’s what I said, all you had to do was smile, and you had to associate with the people they approved of. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And you couldn’t go with children they didn’t appro -- especially my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My dad was a hardworking man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  You s -- mentioned that you had a lot of friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I always had a lot of friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Were they friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or from --
ANSWER:  Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they got sparse, less and less friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that’s really interesting you’re asking that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I still remember Fritz Erlow, we were raised together. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I loved Fritz as much as li -- I liked my brother -- loved my brother, Bernard. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">If we passed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , he wouldn’t see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">If I passed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> when it was dark -- at that time used to go out in the evening -- at the beginning, later on we didn’t go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn’t been seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So -- but that really hurts, because in a way I knew that the reason for it, because I was a Jew, but it’s very hard for children to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You -- you take it personally, because I would cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I saw some of the girls I used to play with, and they run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Why doesn’t she like me any more? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I haven’t done anything to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It -- it’s hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  And they probably went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talked to their parents also, how bad they felt, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Do you remember what was -- were those the first incidents that made you realize that you were somehow different than these other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  When we were kicked out the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I think it was the beginning of the fifth grade, because I supposed to have gone to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> also, like my brother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But there were articles in the paper that they built in a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for handicapped children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt-au</span> -Main, and this was a very dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I mean, nowadays, it be condemned. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And that’s the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And that’s --
QUESTION:  What year would that have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Let me just think, I was born in ’24, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in ’30, it might have been in ’35. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Oh, that- the dates are getting dimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They really are. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I mean, what happened you remember, but to remember the exact dates, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened until °45. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And nothing was good, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So -- but what they didn’t know, we got a much better education than we did in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , because they wouldn’t let Jewish college professors teach, so we got the college professors to teach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So we benefited from it, we really did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  How far did you have to travel to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  It’s -- didn’t have to travel, it was within walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">In [indecipherable] of so many miles, they had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we weren’t bused at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Was your family afraid when Hitler came to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, I saw Hitler many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was a nosy child. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And whenever he came, I would not go down to see him in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because everybody knew I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I would go blocks and blocks out of my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And -- where they didn’t know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I was standing in the front row, I was -- I was just fascinated by him, it was just like he hypnotized people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But you know, I usually talk with my hands [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That’s all -- ’'m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Well, I would always be in the front row, many blocks away from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I would stay on the front row with everybody else, and everybody yelling, heil Hitler here. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He always came in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convertible</span> , and naturally he would hold his hand on the belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I can close my eyes and see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Heil Hitler, heil Hitler, and people just went crazy screaming, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And they all were running and I was right there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he wouldn’t let them get too close, and then he just would take his hands slowly, and everybody would go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It just like you were hypnotized, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So this was °33. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But really, °32 already it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">There were Communist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about the same time and there always -- somehow there was a shooting going on, and they’re yelling and they used to hit each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And my mother always used to grab my hand and let’s go upstairs, let’s go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">No, I want to see what goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In ’32, you know, I was eight years old, I was nosy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  What did you think when you were watching these -- these speeches and Hitler --
ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I really don’t, I just was fascinated by that whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was just like everybody was hypnotized. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And his speeches were in -- he didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He said three, four words and then yell, everybody yelled, heil Hitler, heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I don’t know, as a child -- the one thing I remember, he’s always, when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> , it was a pretty good size <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at that time, the size of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lovell</span> , he would stay in the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Germania</span> , and every time I passed that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I was going to stay there someday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  So you admired him a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You’re kind of fascinated, until, you know, then I didn’t admire him any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I mean, what came afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My mother always said, it can’t get any worse, it can’t get any worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Like when they deported my dad to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in ’38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me a little more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  One night we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Mother wasn’t feeling well and she already was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and the doorbell rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They always were very noisy and always yelling and always rushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And they always rushed, you know, and they were yelling, open that <span class="DLF">door</span> , open that <span class="DLF">door</span> , and they kicked the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So my dad went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they came in and they said, empty your pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And my dad said, “Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I haven’t done anything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He was at work that day, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Well, just empty your pockets and you do as we tell you, and your sooner you do it, your sooner you be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And they took my dad away. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Th-They pocket all his belongings and his favorite watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I don’t remember who gave him that watch, it was a gold watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was a pocket watch, that was the style at that time.</span></p>
