<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My name is Regina Bomba, from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburger</span> ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Where uh when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , on the 5th of June, 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Will you tell me, Regina, what happened to you, please, when the Nazis came in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">When the Nazis came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , we were still on this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was name Wisniowa Gora, and we decided that we going to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">When we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was taken away by the Nazis, so we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a brother of ours, of my oldest brother, Rubin (ph), who at that time was in the Polish army fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and his wife and a six-month old baby was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And after that we stayed with my brother in my brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I'm not going to say how it happened that my brother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the army and he took his wife and a six-month old baby and he said he wants to go to <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">That's the only place he said where the Jews could survive, and he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father, my mother, my sister and one brother, sister younger one, a brother older one than me that were staying in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until March 1940, 10th of March 1940 when the Gestapo came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We thought that we're going to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They already made it for the Jews, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They took everyday from certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The fact that my mother had a sis...a brother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he said uh bring every...all the stuff here because when you're going to go, all you can do take is a valise. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">This way bring over stuff to me and when you come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you'll have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When the the Nazis came in to take us down...it was during the night...one o'clock at night...my mother forget that she went down in the house shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And we went down...we thought we're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we said alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We're going to have everything over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">For us the soldier said wouldn't you let me go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother is cold and she would like to have some shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He said oh, it's going to be soon summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You can go barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She can go barefooted. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So instead to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they told us that we're going to be going out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They took away our money, our possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They took off a ring from my mother...she had a fat finger...and they couldn't take it off...with the flesh and they sent us to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowo Radomsko</span> and they put us in a burned <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Radomsko</span> was 1 . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">maiden name bombarded very, very badly and they had already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But I must say the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , especial there was a man named Burger (ph)...he was the oldest from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he brought some food special for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I still have my little sister...was a still a small little girl and uh I always....I younger...I always looked older, and my mother said, well, we have to do something to make something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">What we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My mother was washing <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> for people, because my father got ill nght away when...he was a very delicate man, long, very tall, and uh from the nature he was not...my mother was the stronger one, for everything for father, and he...from the beginning he said right away I don't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I cannot live like this, and I don't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">From mine...seven children I brought up, from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for everything what I worked, I'm here in a burnt <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and strolling and a (indecipherable), and on the top of it, his foot got very swollen and very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So we decided that...there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">Polish hospital</span> , Jews were not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> , so we hired a Polish (indecipherable)...a Polish...that was a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Called in a Polish (indecipherable), a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and we...I took my father and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and there we arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That's the time that I came...the first time in my life to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My mother was behind in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with my sister and my brother and I decided...my father was out out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ...how...where is he going to go back to that burnt <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , so I was looking around a way to to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I had 50 Polish zloty...what the Germans give...[ took away...we...our Polish...our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> belonged to the 3rd Reich, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I...and that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> was Protectorate for us for that's where they give us the Polish money, so with that money I rented an apar...uh a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by a family, and I brought over my sister and my brother and my mother so we stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In 1942 I said I'm going to make a brief...before Yom Kippur, and that's the first time of our life that comes this kind of a holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The saddest time of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I guess all the lives from Czestochowa Jews, and maybe for other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , that was a day that their Gestapo came and they took out the people for the liquidations. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They call it the akti...the aktions. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I don't know how it is...akt...aktion... aktion in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And before that all it was the holidays and they took out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and made another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we did not have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We were the refugees so we didn't know so many Czestochowans, people...so many...you know, that protects you, how you say, that we should get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So the (indecipherable) rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radomsko</span> invited my father with his family for the holidays, and I was left behind to wait for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so they went and I was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I stayed there for a little while and I said no...I am going also going there, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radomsko</span> , just for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Stayed with them and then I decided since I don't look so Jewish, I am going to go back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , bought a ticket, and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> to wait for the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">In meantime in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radomsko</span> was judenrein...you know what that means, judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Clean of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Only a few I think were left behind because two of them came back, two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> later on, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They were hid in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I stayed there...I met a fellow in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> while my father was laying there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and he took me into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...he had a father and a mother and a sister, but the mother said it's not nice that a girl should stay in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , with a fellow, so they decided that I should get married to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He was much older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was fifteen years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I got married by myself, and I even...somebody borrowed me a little veil and a dress and I got married, and if you don't want to have children, then you have them sometimes, and I become pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I called up my mother and I told her about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was May 15, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And I told her, and she said I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I would like to come, but I can't because we....they were not allowed, the Jewish people, to travel and that was the last time I spoke to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I spoke to her by telephone through the Jewish komitet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowo Radomsko</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now after that, my husband was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> , so he took me into that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">His parents were sent away with the whole family, sisters, two sisters and a niece and his parents, and we stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">After that we were... was washing the bloody wash from the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I didn't know what else to do but I wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They left us for the next ones to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">After that they send us to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was named <span class="BUILDING">Factory Iskovitch</span> (ph), and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...I don't know the name...where my husband was near the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">All of a sudden when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...I hadn't mentioned his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">His name was Shlomo Muskovitch (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And somebody say hey, Muskovitch (ph) is <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and I looked it out and I saw him taking his rucksack and his head down...he didn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I saw him through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and that's the last time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> because they needed another hundred men for the transport, so this they sent him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And here I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...they sent us to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and pregnant, alone, not from a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , without any family, without nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So everybody was making groups to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the ho...in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That's what they give us...a few <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and uh I was sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on my rucksack and my things...I took a few things because I was thinking we weren't going to have some <span class="NPIP">place</span> the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">In fact the doctor wanted to make an abortion right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I said what, my father would...he was a religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That would be the worst thing that anybody could have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It's a sin. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So I didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But by the time we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , by the time think it was late...so we were in...eight people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was a wo...a lady...at that time to me she was an older lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Maybe she was forty-five years old and she had a daughter my age and she said, believe me, Regina, you'll see...make an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Otherwise you're not going to live because she said you're young. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You'll get married again. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You'll have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I went to one doctor to make an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He he wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He thought it's too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Then we went to another doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I even remember her name...her name was Dr. Grunwald (ph), a woman doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">In middle of abortion, she said I think you're going to die...the head is so big. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You are very far...you must be having the fifth month already. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I said yes I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">She said why I didn't ask you any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She said I've assumed that you're in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I didn't...1 didn't show so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I'm I'm tall, so I didn't show so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I said no, I I...you didn't ask me what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And she said well...and the abortion was made on a small, tiny <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , holding my own legs because there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or anything, and of course we they didn't want to wait any longer because it was pretty late and I listened to that older lady, what she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She said if you don't go and make an abortion now, a little bit soon it's going to show and then they're going to send you away for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We want you to live, and that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I had an abortion and I was...after that had to go to work, bleeding, and go to work and I was working and uh after one year they made another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They made three <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The young, the girls that we had no husbands like me, the men, and married couples where they also had a <span class="DLF">street</span> , so there were three <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were going out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">What happened...a lot of things what with my husband even said I was listening there about uh that uh Vislovich (ph) that they killed him laying right before my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But like I said, we're going to make it short. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They sent us to this...1 was working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> named HASAG’. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I worked...got up in the morning, five o'clock appel. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Seven o'clock we went to work and seven o'clock we returned, and we worked there until June 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That day we didn't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We prepared to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like every day and all of a sudden and to this day I don't know how that happened...all of a sudden we looked around by the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of going out from that HASAG, from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...it took us an hour to walk to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">All of a sudden thousands of Ukrainians with their machine guns to us and from where they come from until this day I don't know how that happened so quick and they said, halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was put up and at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> went up a man...he was some kind of director from that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and he said...this this was exactly his words, because I was there: "In eure gewesenem Lager geht ihr nie mehr guruck." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That means in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you don't go never back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You're going to stay here until we're going to let us live. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That was exactly his words. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Women were fainting because they had children, mothers...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> still had, you know, a lot of people and I had...knew Abraham...I had him and I (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="133">What I'm going do? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So my uh two cousins of mine, two sisters...there were three but one of the sisters was working by sor...sorting buttons from the people from the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> who left behind, so they had a thing, the job was to put buttons to buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They found a sock with buttons for a Pole...for a Polish man, and he said that the people from the <span class="DLF">Garibaldiego street</span> where they working with the buttons, they give him the buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So they took my cousin, a first cousin, my mother's sister's daughter...the two sisters have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They're here in too in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and took her...her name was the beautiful Paula. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She was such a beautiful girl...I I cannot ex...there's pictures ; Hugo Schneider Aktiengesellschaft-Metalwarenfabrik, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> from her too. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The sisters have pictures from her, and they took her and other eight people, nine, and a child nine year old because there was a couple with a child...and other seven...nine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They took them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they put a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and they killed them and she had a ring and she had a little uh how you call it...a chain, a golden chain, and there was a German standing and he said she was so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off of her, and she said listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">You're looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Do me a favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I have two sisters in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> HASAG. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Could you give this to my sisters? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I'll give you their name, and he came back and he gave it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They still have this. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My husband saw this girl...you ask my husband what a beautiful girl she was and uh we we come in and he came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he told us that we don't go no more to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My cousins said to me, the two sisters said you talk pretty good German. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Why don't you ask him what's going to happen to the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">From nature I am not a shy person like my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I walked over to him and I got my courage and I said I would like to ask you, do me a favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Please Mr., what's going to happen to the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He said they're going to come tomorrow to that to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">For a minute we were very happy that that he said that but we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The next day...Abraham came and another couple of people came...I don't know how many exactly but quite a few young people came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Was no children, not older people, plenty of young people didn't come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When I left that day in the morning...I saw Abraham at night and I told him, Abraham, you know I had a pair of earrings of my grandmother's put it on on me when I was only three days old. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I said I'm going to give you these earrings. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It's very dear to me, and I had a watch and I had a wedding band and I had pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That was the most important for my family, a lot

from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the to the uh <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> , they told them to put all their valuables...they didn't know they're not going to go back, so everything was left in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But I was so happy and pleased and that he came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we told him look, they made a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for all the women, one on top of the other, and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then they stopped making <span

it already...that the police were taken with hammers over the heads, knocking them down and then taking them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> for burial, and the wife of one policeman...her name 1s Mrs. Kohn (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She lives now I believe now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">She was left alone with a

and she was like you know not herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">She didn't know she had a child, like you call it crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Mishkoiradich’ (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Regardless of how you say it in English, like like...not like crazy running around but quiet, very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We had a doctor and he said that nothing he can do for her, so we gave her a broom in her hand and that she is the one who cleans the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and that...with that broom she was sitting all the time in those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">What we going to do with the child? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We made it a little

</span><span class="sentence" id="177">He got very tiny and he didn't grow and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Whatever we could, you know...everybody from us gave him a little

and they called the...Mr. Kurlon (ph) I think was the man from the Jewish uh elders and he called him and he said what's this. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He said listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I lost my family but I cannot, I couldn't have the heart to give this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I'll do with him whatever you like. </span><span

interested in everyone but this is the episode that I wanted to tell you that I thought it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">HASAG</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I was working very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I was working so hard because they took away...every time a couple of hundred of people and they send them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tre</span> ... don't know wherever they sent them away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We didn't know exactly where they were sending people, so like I had one machine...we were making ammunitions. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Then I had to have three machines, so if one machine made Schmelz’...Schmelz means when the Rohstoff’ did not come out too good, so he...it was punishment, so I I I couldn't be at once on all the three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> , that was for three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Abe called me I'm a dancer, I'm dancing from one machine to the other, and at the top of it they made it very hard for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We used to take the Rohstoff, put 1t in a very high, big machine <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and that machine was going this way and it came out at once in a big box, the Rohstoff, and this was only uh we called it Matrizen®. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That means that the the bullet goes in * in a stupor (Yiddish) * melted metal (German) > raw material (German) ° mold (German) in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I don't know how you call it in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We call it in German the Matrizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And the bullet goes in in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The bullet was a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> where people were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So one day I had Schmelz down but the work was not done. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He said why did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I didn't do it, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I said I have for this machine then that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You've got to call up Heinrich (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="218">That means the man who's fixing the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I said I did but I couldn't do it while I was on this machine, so I got 'strafe...punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Punishment...1t was my twelve hours work regular. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">The other twelve hours was the 'strafe and then it was again my time to work and it was at night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">For thirty-six hours without nothing, eating, standing what we got to eat, so I was so tired so I sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I don't know a German walked over... where he got such a foot I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I was not such a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I'm tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He picked me up with his foot and he he...I I got up, with his foot, while I'm sitting and eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I'm not going to tell you how many times we got beaten up for things that was...a minimum we got beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">As long as we were not shot, and then on the top we had a very bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">There was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skarzysko</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They had liquidated that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they sent the people to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in that HASAG in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> .

were the...if ours were very bad, theirs were ten time worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They went with the guns like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There was special one man...his name is so good for him...his name was Bartenschlager’, and he had...he didn't go...he didn't talk to nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">If he did see something he didn't like it, he shot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I had the pleasure once to see him next to my machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I figured that seven o'clock we're finishing and at five to seven I made my accord everything was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Five minutes before I'm going to clean up my machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Everything had to be spotless. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They're very clean, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">That that you can't take away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I cleaned up my machine and he came over and he said, "Wieviel spat ist es?" </span><span class="sentence" id="246">What time is it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I said, Herr Meister. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">He said seven? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He looked at the watch and it was just maybe a quarter second after seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He hold that gun, "Pass! </span><span class="sentence" id="252">mal auf."” </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Because he saw my machine was clean already, and I was so lucky that he didn't shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He must have liked my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I don't know, because he didn't do...he didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He'd have shot right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That was another luck I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And then again, I had a cousin and she was working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augenschein</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That was the bullets...they had to make the bullets so nice and so clean cause any tiny little scratch, the bullet doesn't shoot out, so it had to be done very...and she was a very beautiful girl, a face like a doll, with with big lashes but when she looked up the lashes went until here and if you looked down the lashes went until here. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So she couldn't see so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Every day she went...there

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  This girl...you want me to tell you about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That was uh still when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That was not in the HASAG. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We were working in a <span

uh uh <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So one day we were working by the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> just like that and that one of the foremens...actually he was from the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...a foreman, from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He was a tall man. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I believe that man must have been seven feet big. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Such a tall man I never...we had to look up. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I am not so small...had to look up looking like that to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">His name was Lajzer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I don't know the second name...the second name was Lajzer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I know he had a wife, no children, because she had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> right next to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and she used to take in two blond girls, you know...friends of mine also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> , two sisters to warm up a little bit and they...she used to give them socks to mend that they should rest a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I never had that uh luck to go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I used to go in to the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> sometime from the uh uh conductors from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to warm up but they had a fire going and it was bitter cold in January, February, but working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we didn't...we were not clothed so uh all of a sudden he he said uh he opened a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and he took in our...one by one asking questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">When the people came out, each boys and girls, we asked them what did he say. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">What did they want? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They said we're not allowed to say anything, so until I didn't go in I didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">When I went in he asked me a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He called me by my name Regina. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">For some reason he liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He said Regina, you tell me the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I said of

</span><span class="sentence" id="326">I said we're walking every day but she never said one word and the woman was sitting with him was a Jewish woman, and I said to her...Rosa was her name...Rosa, what do you want me...you better tell she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I said what do you want me to tell? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I don't know what it's all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">She said well, they're talking that I am in love with Mr. Lajzer (ph) and that I am have business with him and they took him to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">She told me that and that they're making a big uh investigation about him, because this is not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">A Jewish woman with a German is not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So I said believe me that's the honest truth...and all of a sudden they told me to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">When I went out, they called her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She was the next one to go 1n and as she went in, she went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That same minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And he behind her with a gun, just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And she did like that...and all of a sudden he grabbed her and she grabbed him and they were twisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I don't...like I said she was a small woman, not a big woman like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">A girl, a young girl, maybe sixteen or fifteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">She throwed him down, that big man, fat man. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He throwed down...she was rolling with him...he was all...his his clothing, you know...the German was full with sand and with mud and she didn't let herself killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">All of a sudden, like I said...we walked over. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We begged him, and then there was a like man who used to be a neighbor of his in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He was sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> , and then from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and he walked over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He grabbed him by his arm and he said listen Mr. Lajzer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You're such a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You've been my neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Please, you're going to be sorry later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She's a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Maybe she didn't mean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Don't kill her, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">About that time she ran and she ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">2 pickaxe (note: "kilof" not found in German dictionary, rather in Polish dictionary) She ran away very, very fast, far as she could and she walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">She's all been to a different group from people working also out but they walk into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she got in back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The next...she had a husband this one young lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But she got married a short time before and his name was Stefek (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I don't...cannot remember the second name but my husband has a picture in uh the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> from his <span class="DLF">grave</span> because there's massen-grave there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They called them they called them twenty-seven at once and he was working in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> and she took him to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> because he should have easier for him, but at that time she didn't know that she's going to be in love with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">One thing she did tell me when I asked her...I said your husband is complaining that you're going out to dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Not...I didn't say with Paula. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I said your husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And said that you're going out to dinner with a German and he is jealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So she walked over and she said to that to that German, you know Herr Meister my husband 1s eiferstichtig. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That means he is jealous, and and he said no, you pass my love. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I have nothing to do with your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He was very very jealous and she told him that and she didn't think anything, you know, and he didn't think anything, but when we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he said Regina, she's not coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to sleep anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">She cannot say that she is not going out with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Of course I...my mouth was sealed, not allowed to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I said oh don't say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Maybe she is working with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Maybe, you know, there's a lot of things to work...she's a foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">She's a Jewish foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">All of a sudden when we come back the next day

<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  I was liberated in January 16, 1945 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">memorial (Yiddish)
QUESTION:  By then you were married...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Of course with Abraham, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We were together and like Abraham told you, we ran away from the...the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That was for itself a thing that we could have been killed just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was Offensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The Germans were fighting with the Russians, and wherever we went, the Germans told us don't go here. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They didn't know who you are, when we ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But they told us to go in a <span class="NPIP">side</span> , over the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Then all of a sudden I said to my husband, Abe, if the Nazis did not killed us, they they the bullets are going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Let's go in to any <span class="NPIP">place</span> we can, so we went into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there was Polish people standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I went over and in Polish...I speak a very good Polish...and I said to them, please, couldn't you let us in just for one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We are going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and we don't seem...the Nazis don't let us go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , go past. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">There were Germans all over tell us to go this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I said you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Go in here, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">There's a Polish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">She has only one son and she has a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I walked in and I said in Polish, "Niech bedzie pochwalony Jezus Chrystus.""</span><span class="sentence" id="445">° It's the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It's the honest truth and I said please, we cannot go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Would you...oh she so (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She said of course, of course, come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">In fact she said to me if we're going to have to run, if they're going to bombard our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you take...grab anything because you don't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She was sewing on a machine rucksacks, you know, to put in stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">She put a lot in stuff and she said you can take something and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">She gave us something to eat and to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Abe was so frightened with Jewish face that he all the time was holding his head down and like sleeping and uh there was another woman running after us, a blonde woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I don't remember her name but she was a blonde, older lady and she was together with us and she went into the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with us and she was sitting also straight and she looked all the time at my husband, this woman but she didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Uh there was another woman from the <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> with a son, a daughter-in-law and a baby a couple of months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">The son had no hands...Polish_ people...because in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ...they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ...but the bombardment...the bomb it dropped into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and cut off both of his hands, so he was normal only he had no hands, so uh I looked at him and she says that she lives on the <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> and with a baby that during the bombardment she is afraid to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">That's why she came down to that neighbor where we were sitting also. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">About five o'clock in the morning she said she's going to go up and make a bottle for the baby, the older lady, the grandmother, so she went up. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She made a bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">She came down with the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And she said in these words. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">In Polish she said there's so many Jews <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and they're all shivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">It was cold, in January...such a cold in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> January...even here in January it's cold in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it is ten times that much colder, and and they didn't have...they were not clothed. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They didn't have too much clothes 8 "May Jesus Christ be blessed." </span><span class="sentence" id="465">on and she said this in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">She said maybe people from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ran away because the bombardment is like that, so I said to myself let me go out and look on the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , so I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I went out on by the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I see people that I was together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I said what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">She said what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I said well we ran away the night before and we were hiding in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the night, and they said we don't know but all of a sudden, about three o'clock in the morning, we didn't see no Germans, so we were afraid because like I said there were (indecipherable) my husband says bombs, it was not bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was hand grenades in a in a uh cover, a cotton cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They were holding hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That's what they did in a lot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , so when (indecipherable) you poisoned food, so we didn't eat that day and for the hand grenades we were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">That's why me and Abraham went out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It wasn't so easy but we we left and uh so so they said we were afraid that they should throw the hand grenades so we ran away, and when we went to the to the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The Germans knew that the Russians are coming, so they ran away, so my...Abe said three o'clock in the afternoon, Abe's sure that the Germans are running to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that are going fast, where they could drop. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I said you know my father said 1914 there happened something like that, 1916, when the war was, you know, that his father told him that the Germans are running up. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The Russians came in, you know, Ist World War...it looks like Ist World War, but the Germans are running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But he wasn't sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Then uh when I saw that I went out and what I saw...I saw...that picture I'll never forget as long as I live either. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> coming up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , waving to us and we asked them how are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Thank God that you liberated us. </span><span

class="sentence" id="484">They were so happy, so like like not to go for war...like it was a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That hit me so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I said my God, look at those young boys how they're running na <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And I went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I said to Abraham in Yiddish, Kim'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He opened his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He said what what are

up and all of them got up and all went out, but what I still cannot forget, the last minute because she said you don't have too much time but I'll tell you that anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The Polish woman, the one who had the son without hands, came over and said like that, and the other Polish woman, the the owner from that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He said what's your name, and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He said to me, listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Go to the
