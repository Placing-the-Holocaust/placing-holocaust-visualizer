QUESTION:  When were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  May 10, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  In [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And where were you during World War II?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  In lond -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And I would like you to explain to me how you came to work for the Czech government in exile in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I -- well, I associated mostly with refugees, especially with je -- refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I belonged to a organization called Young Czechoslovakia. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And it -- there I met many people who worked in the Czech government. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Of course, I didn’t have a chance of ever getting into the Czech government, but I met a young man who was a -- a private in the Czech army and one day my uncle asked me to take something to the Czech government, a document, to his friend, mis -- Dr. Schlesinger who worked there, who was a official there. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And wi -- on the way to going to see Dr. Schlesinger I met this young soldier and he said to me, oh, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Are you working for the Czech government? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I said no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I -- I don’t know a minister -- any ministers yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So -- because it was so difficult to get into it, I’m -- just almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he said, well come and see me at two o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I went to see Dr. Schlesinger, my uncle’s friend and I said, this man, I didn’t even know his name, a-asked me to come and see him at two o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And he said well, if he told you to go and see him, go and see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I -- I asked him for his name and he told me what his name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I described the gentleman to him, and then at two o’clock I went to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and as I enter the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> it said, Minister Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was completely stunned because he was so young, and I had absolutely not expected that -- that he would be -- have a -- have a position like that in the Czech government. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In any case, he asked [indecipherable] -- should I put them here? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And so I saw him and he a- asked -- of course I was very surprised and he was surprised at my surprise, and he arranged for me to take a test. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">At that time however, I was working for a company that was important for the war effort and they [indecipherable] want to release me, so for six months I was not released, but after six months I was -- the position was still held for me and that’s how I got to work in the Czech government. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But -- should I continue on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What was the test?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Oh well, I -- the test was extremely complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This mi -- Minister Meyer called up a colleague of his and asked me to -- asked him to give me a test. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">When I came to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> the test consisted of -- he asked me to translate the “Financial Times” from English to Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Course, I didn’t understand a word of the “Financial Times” in English, let alone in Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So I sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> with the “Financial Times” staring me in the face -- mind you, I was very young, of course, I didn’t understand English very well, and of course eco-economics was beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I was terribly embarrassed and I didn’t know what to do and I decided the best thing to do is to just get up and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which I did, and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">At that time we -- my sister and I lived at the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening there was a message from Minister Meyer saying come back for another test. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So I was really, really surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Obviously he was very a-a-anxious to help me to get into the government and he wanted me to have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I came back for another test and this time he gave me a sheet of type -- typed material to copy type, which was, of course, very easy to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And that was my second test and that’s how I succeeded in getting into the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  When you worked for the government in exile, what were your duties and responsibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Well obviously I came in at very low levels, but I was a bilingual secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Of course I -- since I left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , since I left the school system in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> at the age of 13, my expertise in the language was very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But -- and so I’m -- but I suppose able to obvi -- obviously speak fluently and I was required in the Czech government to write and to work in Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I was brought up in the <span class="BUILDING">Slovak schools</span> , so I still hadn’t learned the Czech when I got into the government, but I managed to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I don’t know, one does the best one can and survives. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And people were very ha -- friendly and -- and people helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And so what I did was mostly Czech correspondence and also I did subtitles for films. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I did the -- what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The little te -- the translations, you know, I typed those for Czech films, in Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I did Czech and English correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  When exactly did you start working for the Czech government in exile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I think it was -- I would have to look it up but I -- I can’t remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I think 1t must have been in ’44, 1944, maybe a little earlier, because I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sussex</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> for a year, then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I worked for one year at [indecipherable] at the <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span> , and then I worked -- it must have been foy -- °39 - ‘40 -- °40 -- I would imagine ’43 - ’44 I started working for the Czech government. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But I could easily look it up later and tell you, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  With whom did you work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well most -- of course obviously I -- I -- all these people were refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I -- one -- I mean, I know that the minister -- Meyer, who was minister, I did not work with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He was head of the whole thing, I hardly ever saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I can’t remember the people’s names, but I do have -- I would ha -- I have it written somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There were different people, I mean economists, politicians, I mean, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Ministry of Finance, Industry and Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  What information were your privy to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I mean, you know, not really much information, just correspondence I don’t even remember what it is that -- who we’re writing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But I did th -- mostly -- I remember maybe, that I did short letters, either in English or -- or -- or Czech, and that I did the films. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Possibly did some accounting and other wor -- secretarial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was not a -- I was not privy to any kind of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  I understand you do -- have said that there was nothing that you knew that the general public didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  That’s correct, that’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Were you working for the government when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> protocols were released by the Czech government? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I don’t know if you could comment on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  I was, but I’m afraid I don’t know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I really didn’t at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because first of all, we were really in a very -- let’s say it was sort of like in a state of shock, let’s put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And we were sort of barely managing to exist anyway, because we were trying to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We lived through the London blitz, we didn’t -- I mean, we had to concentrate on survival, on surviving and we were terribly afraid of what’s go -- what’s going on in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We heard terrible things but we didn’t want to believe it because we were very frightened for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And we just lived from day to day and we were mostly together with refugees, other refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And of course we were just -- were not integrated into the British world. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And what happened was that we lived, at first -- I mean, I don’t know exactly the dates, but I would -- I would be able to look them up because I kept all the papers, but we n -- at first we lived in a chur- when we -- after -- after we left the ho -- <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> , we lived in another <span class="BUILDING">girls’ home</span> run by a ger -- German refugee woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And we were four girls to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then we lived -- my sister and another friend and I lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> rented from another -- in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from another refugee, a lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we socialized mostly with other refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">In the evenings we got together with other refugees and we just talked about our s -- but we had some very good times together, too, we had good social evenings, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We went dancing, we had it -- we were very close together because we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But we were not included in the life of the British, and especially not in Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I don’t remember that we have ever been invited to a Jewish holiday, to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don’t think of -- I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I can’t remember that we ever had a Seder in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So we just sort of s-sat around waiting for the end of the war because we thought we would -- we were very anxious for the war to end so that we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  You mentioned a moment ago that there were things that you heard that you didn’t want to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">What kinds of things were you hearing that were -- were frightening you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, hearing terrible things about what was going on in the [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We weren’t sure -- we didn't know the extent of -- of the things and we hoped -- and we always thought that our parents and af -- that our father would survive, because we thought -- he was very popular in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he was very important in the me -- running of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , actually, because he was very helpful with things like the -- he was friendly with the mayor and he was friendly with the local population. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He helped whenever there was any kind of problem with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire engines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He was into everything, actually in -- and he was very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He was a mechanic and [indecipherable] a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , we had some farm animals and he was very friendly with the local population, so I thought people would protect him. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So we were hoping that h -- we kept on saying that probably our parents would be okay, but still we worried terribly about our friends and about the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because my father’s family, the majority of the family lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , just across the <span class="DLF">border</span> from where we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zakopane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We lived in a northern -- northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which is very close to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And so we worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And of course, during the war my father -- I mean, before the war, when <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was occupied and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- ther-there was trouble in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my father used to walk refugees from those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because they were escaping from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So we worried, of course, about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And of course, about our grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Oh, and there was one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My grandmother, who was -- lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zakopane</span> , came to live with our parents, because when things got bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> she came across to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and lived with our parents, and we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult for our parents because I knew that my father would never leave as -- as long as his mother was staying with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  In your previous interview, you mentioned that there was some anti-Semitism in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I wanted to ask you, what was the official position of the government in exile on the treatment of the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  It didn’t come up in our conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I didn’t know what the position was. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I have met people who have been in the Czech Air Force here after the war, and they said they -- they -- they were an-anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I didn’t experience any anti-Semitism in the Czech government at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">In fact, many of my coworkers were Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, I mean, I just felt very comfortable there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In fact, the majority -- I mean, I will get to that later probably, but most of the people I worked with were Jewish, okay? [</span><span class="sentence" id="118">phone ringing]
QUESTION:  Let me stop for just one moment, we have a disturbance. [</span><span class="sentence" id="119">tape break] Okay, we’re back. ?'</span><span class="sentence" id="120">m sorry for that interruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I had asked you if you had experienced any anti-Semitism with respect to your work for the government in exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Did you experience any anti-Semitism any time while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Yes, actually, we did, and the -- we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We lived there as long as they allowed us to live there, because after five years we had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But especially during the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , people were very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean, there was one woman in particular that used to make remarks which were very painful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But otherwise the matron and the rest of the people were not Jewish -- I mean we were the only Jewish girl -- as far as I know we were the only Jewish -- three Jewish girls at the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I don’t remember that there was any anti-Semitism except one or two people were anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But of course, they were careful when we were around, they didn’t say much. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But one person was very outspoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  What kinds of things did she say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Oh, she was very angry about what happened with Bernadotte, when he was assassinated, and she f -- said some terrible -- I mean, she had said very painful things which were very pr -- very painful to me because I felt, since we experienced so much anti-Semitism at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and since what was going on in Europe, and then we are experiencing it in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I felt very disillusioned, but you know, that kind -- that was the only one, as far as I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  While you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , were you aware of any attempts to smuggle Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , during the war years especially, or immediately after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Not during the war, but immediately after the war I had a cousin who survived a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I went to visit her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And there she lived in -- outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with lots of small children from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I knew that the [indecipherable] went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And she was one of the people who was [indecipherable] out, that took those children to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Course -- course we were very involved with knowing what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and we were very Zionistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I mean we -- I thought I would end up in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one day, but -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but it didn’t work out that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Was there any public rush -- recognition in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> of the existence of the Jewish brigade in the British army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Not that I know -- I mean, I did -- I wasn’t aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But because we were very pat- patriotic, we knew about the Czech army, we knew about all the other armies, but I didn’t know about the Jewish brigade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Did you follow the local BBC broadcasts and the local newspapers regularly during the war years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yes indeed, we followed the BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Every single evening at nine o’clock they played the national anthems. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Af -- and we waited every single night at nine o’clock to hear the anthem of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , because we were se -- I -- unbelievably patriotic, when I -- we were just brought up that way, that we were just hoping for the end of the war and we just wanted to hear the national anthem because [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And so we listened to the news, we listened to BBC, we listened, we read the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Yes, we knew what was going on, as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Course we didn’t underst -- our English was limited, but we als -- but we had a lot of informations through the young Czech clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  How was the liberation of Bergen-Belsen reported in the British media?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Don’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I don’t remember much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I mean, that whole time it was -- I don’t know whether it was because we were so frightened to even think about these things or look at the papers or hear about it, that I don’t recall anything about it, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don’t even remember when I first heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I don’t remember much, except that we lived sort of in fear of this, what was going on and -- and I don’t remember how I found out about these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  How did you learn that the war was over?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Well, it had a tr-tremendous impact in that I always felt -- first of all, when we left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , our mother -- our parent tr -- were very anxious for us to s -- be close together, not to -- to look after each other and so we -- I made a point always of wondering -- of asking myself how would my parents have dealt with this situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">What would they have expected of me? </span><span class="sentence" id="676">How would I respond to anything that has come up in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And I would always go by what I thought my parents would expect of me, which may not have been the best way, but this is how I managed to- first of all I did that to -- in respect to -- for my parents, because I felt the responsibility to take care of mys -- of myself and my sisters -- and my younger sister, the way my parents would have expected me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And therefore I lived my life like that, which may not have been the best way. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And also, it was difficult because I wanted to know -- I always felt that I did not learn -- I didn’t know exactly how to -- my parents would have -- how -- I would have been taught certain things when I was growing up, and therefore I was afraid, I always said I wouldn’t know how to t-teach my children, because I didn’t have an example of my parents teaching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And so I muddled through it somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">That’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And sometimes maybe I didn’t do it -- the greatest job, but it worked out the best I -- I did the best I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I did the best I could.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  The first time I went back was in 1968, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Could have been a little earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We arrived in- we planned to go back because at that time things seem to have eased up in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and we decided that was the time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And it was very important for me to make my trip back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , since I had never been back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with plans to take a rent-a-<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and drive to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">When we got to [indecipherable] Peter and myself and our son, who was then seven or eight years old, when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I suddenly got cold feet and I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I said to Peter, no, let’s forget about it, I don’t want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">For several reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">First of all, I was very afraid of going back for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Secondly, I wasn’t sure about the pol -- about the communist -- what was going -- you know, how it will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And it was just really frightening to me to go back, but Peter said no, we came all this way, we are definitely going back -- we are definitely driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So we rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we drove to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">We arrived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at six o’clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It was not recognizable, because it used to be a very charming little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lower Tatras mountains</span> and now it was sort of like a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">A lot of <span class="BUILDING">cement buildings</span> all around and di -- very dilapidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at six o’clock in the evening and I didn’t know who to ask for and I didn’t know exactly where -- where everything was, it seemed to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And when we arrived in ce-center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I asked -- I decided to ask for my gir -- girlfriend, who used to be the mayor’s daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Her name was Maria Bautiva She was my girlfriend, who was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And so we stopped in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I said, do you know Maria Bautiva? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And they -- I said, it’s probably not her name any more, because it was her name when she was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">She may- she’s probably married and -- but this person know -- knew who she was and she said, she died two years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I was so disappointed because I had not been in touch with her since 1939, but I felt she would be the only person I could think of that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And so then we decided to go and look at -- at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And I couldn’t recognize it, it was so run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">The entire <span class="DLF">street</span> was so run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And at first I didn’t know where it was, and I said to him, let’s go to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , because from the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> I know how to find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , and walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , when there was this hou -- what seemed to be our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which my father finished building in 1938, it was brand new when we left it. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We left in °39, my father finished building this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And there were some children playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And said to the children, do you live in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And they said yes, we do, we -- three families live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We live on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I -- I said, go and ask you mother whether we could come in, because I used to live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And so she went in, we came to the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the child went in and she ran upstairs and she said to her mother, somebody wants to come and look at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And the mother stood at the top of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , she looked down at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">She knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the husband’s room where he was ta -- taking a nap, and she says to her husband, come down, Miss Eberstark arrives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I was absolutely shocked, I said, how did you know who I was? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">She said, well who else could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Because I said I lived there, so she knew exactly in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">That was 1939, this was 1968, 30 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And so we went up there and of course I looked -- and she said that two families lived downstairs [indecipherable] lived upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And they -- and I couldn’t find one stick of anything that belonged to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">There was nothing that was recognizable. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And they immediately sent for other people to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And he was telling u -- this man was apparently the same age as we were -- I-I was, and he said we used to play when we were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And then he said, I remember your grandfather and he pointed to his [indecipherable] your grandfather always used to wear this gold watch with a big gold chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And he made out as if the chain were four 1 -- three inches wide, which was a little gold chain, but to him that chain seemed to be a huge gold chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">In any case, it was -- then they insisted that we spend the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Oh, another person was called, and they antic -- we were looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay for the night and this man insisted that we spend the night at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was nice of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">We spend the night there and at 10 o’clock in the morning I said to Peter, we’ve got to get out of here, I can’t stand being here. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And we went to a Jewish -- the only thing we did was g-go to a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> and we -- oh, everywhere we went -- I mean that first night, everybody wanted to buy our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They said, could we buy your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from you? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I said no, it’s not my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So they s -- and anyway, next morning we went to my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And everybody there said also, could we buy the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from you? </span><span class="sentence" id="878">All these people lived there, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">There were lots of people living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  And how people were asking you if they could buy your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , if they could buy your grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Th-The next morning -- so we ca -- arrived at six in the evening and next morning the person who -- at whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we spent the night, wanted us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">district building</span> , or whatever it is, to find out how much taxes are due on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because he was interested in buying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And reluctantly I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And the women who was in charge of the files, brought out the files and told us about the tax, how much tax is due and she said to us, to me, she would like to buy the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">At this point I said to Peter, I’ve got to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">First of all, I was not negotiating to sell any of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but it was -- but I still -- still wanted to go to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , which we did, we went -- which is between two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">One side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> belonging to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the next <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> belongs to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> - next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">All the stones were turned -- knocked down and I couldn’t find my grandmother’s s-stone and her <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But we just wandered around the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , just completely overgrown and completely demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Stones were scattered all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Then I said to Peter, we’ve got to get out, I was feeling sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So at 10 o’clock in the morning -- oh, in the -- then we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , where we used to spend a lot of time with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there was a big <span class="DLF">grave</span> where they -- <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> where they murdered some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I always suspected that my grandfather was murdered there, but I could never find out, and that’s one thing I did not really find out who was -- the names are not on the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , so I don’t know who 1s buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Then we saw -- met one Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">His family -- I don’t know what happened to his family, he didn’t seem to be all with it, but he converted and became a Catholic and he’s married to a Catholic woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">His name was Shaiman, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And at 10 o’clock in the morning we pulled out and I sat in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , Peter and our son sat in the -- Peter was driving, our son sat next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I sat in the back because I couldn’t sit up, I had to lie down. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I was sick all the way, all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I was vomiting all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I was so ill that when we arrived at the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> , Peter didn’t see the patrol, the ca -- people trying to stop our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , he t -- almost drove right through it -- through the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We were almost shot because Peter was in such state trying to get me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because I was so ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And then th- [indecipherable] is dark and there was lanterns being installed [indecipherable] people were trying to stop him from driving past those lanterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And he stopped and the guard said, what are you trying to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="911">You must stop at the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And then h-he talked -- he saw me being very ill and he just opened our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , examined the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> and let us go right through. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at -- at 11 o’clock at night and I went straight to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , it took me two or three days to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I just stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and tried to recover from my first visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But, that was a very, very important visit for my life, because that changed a lot for me in my life ca -- this visit, because for years and years, ever since I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I just felt like I was living from a suitcase, even though I was married and had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I just felt that there was something not quite right and that I ha -- like I was waiting for something to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Well -- and I was sort of longing for <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and for my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And having made this trip back, suddenly it dawned on me that -- because I was -- I always loved snowdrops and wild -- and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and having made the trip back, I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said, well, snowdrops and wild strawberries are not everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I -- and it sort of finished that chapter of my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That was a very, very important time. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">When I came back from this trip, it really -- it did something for my entire being. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It made me feel settled, more settled in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I felt this is where I belong and this is where I am and I stopped being so torn towards going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  Was that your only trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Then we made another -- one other trip -- well, I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> again, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , once. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But then my -- my middle daughter came, who is a writer, a journalist, wanted to go back, which really surprised us. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">She wanted to go and visit my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So we decided to make a trip back about four years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">We stayed also a very short time, but it was wonderful for me to be able to take her, to show her where I was born, where my parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And we didn’t go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> this time, because nobody seemed to be there, but it was very run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And -- but we just walked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Of course, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which is there, which 1s not a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> any longer, it’s men’s club or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">It used to be a grain storage after the war, when we went back first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Then we went to a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Somebody seems to be taking care of the tombstones. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">But one thing I did not do, which I still have to do one day when I go back, I didn’t talk to anyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I just didn’t feel like I could talk to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I should have done that, I should have gone to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to the -- what, a <span class="BUILDING">district building</span> , whatever they call that, to find out who survived, who 1s there, who is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I didn’t ask anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I just didn’t talk to anybody, I didn’t feel that I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But we wandered around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , we went to the -- passed the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , everybody was staring at us because we were looking up and down where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Then we asked the taxi driver to drive us to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We went and took photos and movies of the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Then we went to stop at the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to which I went, and my daughter just adored it all and thought it was marvelous to have been -- made the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Now we have to take the -- my oldest daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Are you planning on any more trips?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  Yes, we want to go with my older daughter to s -- to do the same thing, because all the -- my yo -- son saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , he was only seven or eight years old, but -- so he would be willing to go again. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">But my oldest daughter has never been and she absolutely wants to see it, so one of these days when -- maybe even a year or two, we’ll go again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Was it your middle daughter who was always very sensitive to stories about the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Yes, it’s my middle daughter who was very -- has go -- been to a [indecipherable] get a badge of [indecipherable] when she was very young she wrote a poem about her grandparents and she - she’s the one who went. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">She’s going to write about it, which will be quite exciting because I’m waiting to see that article.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">QUESTION:  Is there anything that we have not discussed that you still want to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  I think we’ve covered more or less everything except, let’s see -- well, I think -- I can’t think of -- probably after we finish Ill think of lots of other things that I haven’t said, because that happened when I did the original tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">After it was done, I thought of many things that I should have mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Mm, well, yes, there are several things that I haven’t mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I haven’t mentioned my uncle, who was instrumental in bringing us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">My uncle, who was my mother’s youngest brother, who lived in lon -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">First he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and so he knew what was going on and then he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and he’s the one who made the arrangements for us to -- to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Now, it was absolutely a miracle that we came out because we lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span> , where no one would have ever imagined that anything would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And we always thought, during the war, that nothing would happen to my parents because we thought our friends, our neighbors would take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">But we were wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Now, if it hadn’t been for my uncle and his wife, Lotte, we would -- who urged our parents, if it hadn’t been for my brave parents who took it upon themselves to put three children on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- my God, when I think about it -- and to give up the children and to send them away, and if hadn’t been for Nicholas Winton, and if it had -- hadn’t been for my guardian who signed for me, and if it hadn’t been for Marda Hess who signed for my oldest sister and my youngest sister, we would never have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And also I want to say that -- that if I had to say anything critical about it, is that nobody paid attention to our education. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I must say that, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> my older sister was left totally without schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">She was 15 years old and nobody thought of sending her to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And 1s -- I think that 1s absolutely awful, that is, when I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And with me it was a miracle that my guardian -- I mean, my uncle persuaded my guardian to send me to <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">That was a big argument, she didn't want to do it because she kept on saying that she only was required to sign, not to do a -- do anything because she -- he promised her that she wouldn’t have to do anything but sign for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And now he was asking her to send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I had to finish my schooling in 10 months where other children went to that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for three years to get the -- or two years, or three years to get the schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I had to do it in 10 months, which was not -- not good because I didn’t speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I had to learn to speak -- take shorthand, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But that is really a shame that no one really paid much attention, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Everybody was so stressed and preoccupied and under such difficulties that nobody thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I mean -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">It seems to me that they could have seen to it that my older sister had some schooling, and that I was sent to a better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> than I did -- was, but still, we -- we’re grateful that we survived and we are grateful that all of these people participated, my uncle, the guardians, my parents, Nicholas Winton, who else? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">A-And everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">It worked for -- for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  I’m not sure you mentioned on this tape the name of your guardian. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Would you please mention her name?</span></p>
