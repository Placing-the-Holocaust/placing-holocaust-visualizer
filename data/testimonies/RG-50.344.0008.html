<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  And that’s about all I can remember of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Now, when we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> , they didn’t have a <span class="INT_SPACE">psychiatric ward</span> , they didn’t have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There were all these little <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> , with tiers of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> and all these living skeletons.</span></p>
