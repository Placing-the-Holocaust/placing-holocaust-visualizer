<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">There were six children, four brothers, two sisters, my father and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The Russians came in the year before the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They took two of my brothers to fight against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We did not know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> came into <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They separated our family by taking the young ones and putting them to work in big <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> , that they made in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , for the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Whoever was able to make shoes, worked so, or make clothes for them, of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We used to work from the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And then they put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> itself, they had two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">One was , and one was . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Not , -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">L landed in . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Then they transferred me to . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And it was -- I did not know where the rest of my family was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Tell me before, how old you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And tell me a little bit about your family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Were you happy? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Tell me about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and tell me about the things -- the dreams that you and your siblings had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  We were a very, very happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Because each one of us did something of musical (sic.). </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My sister was an opera singer at the age of 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She was the first Jewish girl accepted to the Latvian Opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was just the most thrilling, the most wonderful thing anybody -- parents can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My brother sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We all played the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">One played the guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">One played another guitar, or like a -- what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I can't think of the word, the instrument at the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But we were a very, very happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was never just us alone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There was always a friend of mine, or a friend of my brother, or maybe both. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we all ate together. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And we all had a very beautiful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">These are my memories of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My parents were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">At this stage, I realize just how young they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Because my mother was only 49 years old and she was killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And my father was 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I didn't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I was 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So, when I was concentrated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latvia ghetto</span> , they still -- my hopes were still that I was going to see my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was sure that my family is going to be saved, like I thought I was, not knowing what was happening to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Now, my two older brothers, they were chosen to go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , to fight against the Germans, because they were already with the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> came in a year before <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And then we were only left a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But I thought they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latvian concentration camp</span> we had a lot of Christian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">What they did, to be prisoners, I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But they were above us. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They were like capos, they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And they were very cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But we still walked from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to these different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to be useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I told them I could sew, which I learned -- I taught myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I sitting on sewing on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> , part of the German, the Nazis' clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we actually only lived on hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed after some big action, where a lot of people were killed; is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed -- it was separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You see, everybody that they shipped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latvian ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Families came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They were separated from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They split the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And there was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> was not a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They took the very worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , like, and they made it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by wiring around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now, we were happy as long as we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But, we lived now in two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , three families. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">At that time, we were four children and my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Then when we went to work, in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , for the SS men, one day I heard that when we go back, there is going to be massive killing of all the ghetto people. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because they were bringing in more and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, naturally, we wanted to be with our loved ones, but we also wanted to save ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Now, by the end of the day, get picked out the oldest people, the weakest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My youth helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I knew somebody who was like a foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was Jewish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But he was the one who relayed the messages from the SS men to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They didn't speak to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He spoke to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And he was influential enough to put me aside, with another few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And not turn me back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Because that meant death. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Now, the emotion that I had, to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">At this point I couldn't make up my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And it wasn't a question of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was alive until recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I saw him, and I thanked him, again, and again, and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So we knew that that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And new people were brought in, from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What they did, they left us in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But we were very few lucky ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Tell me in that incident, who was the man, and how old were you, and where were your brothers, or did you know where your brothers were, and who kept you from going back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Now, what happened was, I was still the same age, because it didn't take that long in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Maybe I had reached the age of 15, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They heard that all the people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the Latvian Jews and whoever lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were brought to a mass -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they had big, tremendous <span class="DLF">grave</span> dug out, where they shot them, threw them into the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , with shovels. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And some of them were not killed by the bullet, were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they were thrown into that same <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And then they put the dirt over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And even the ones that were alive was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I found out -- I found that out afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There was railroad man, the man that used to control the railroad closing and opening -- he witnessed this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And he said -- he was not Jewish, he just lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And he said, "I will never, ever be able to shut out the scenes and the horrors that the people that were trying to save themselves, and couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I cannot sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I cannot get it out of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It is very difficult for me, which is very much -- to understand how it really affected a man who was totally removed from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">After that, when they killed everybody in that massive <span class="DLF">grave</span> , they liquidated the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they said they were going to send us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We were very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  The man who saved you, what was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  His name was Aaronson (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He was actually, in normal times, he was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellist</span> , a very well-known cellist. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he was in charge, like I said, to relay the messages, between the SS men and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And his name was , which was his stage name. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But it was Aaronson. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I didn't know whether he was alive or not, afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But I just -- I was in touch with him, not too long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He lived in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I spoke to him over the phone, and I thanked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I told him I will never forget him, as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I didn't, because he saved my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Where were your brothers, at the time of the action?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  My two brothers that were sent in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> when the Germans fought the Russians, I don't know what -- I didn't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My other two brothers, on the other hand, I didn't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my sisters, and my parents, I didn't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So, there I was, maybe 14 and a half, 15 years old, and I had no idea of where my family was. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They -- when they told us they were going to ship us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they piled us up in a big, huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> , which was totally empty <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It had -- we were hundreds of us, from both the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And they put us in a standing position. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There were no <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they shipped us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When we arrived there, in order to get where we had to go, they got us out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , whatever you call it, and they put us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , where they ship animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> -- what a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I can smell it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I remember so vividly, that it follows me. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I just saw the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and I saw that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I felt such emotions, that I couldn't even cry, because when you live anything 1n life, like that, for five years, you cannot cry at sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I cry at gladness, because if I go to a birthday party, or any surprise party, it touches me and I cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When it comes to sadness, I don't whether it made me the more -- not stronger, but maybe I have more control over myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now, we arrived with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , at night, in the rain, and these SS women wore capes with hoods. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And we looked out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we saw the capes with hoods. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And these women -- because we did not have SS women in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They only came into the picture in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We looked out, and we saw the camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Then there was beautiful green grass and <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So we thought maybe we will find our loved ones there. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Maybe they were shipped on a different shipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they chased us into those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were the most horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The -- what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were not as wide and the one that is at the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were narrower. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">At the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> later on, they were as wide as the one at the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we had to sit, four of us, in one -- in one -- what 1s it called again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Bunk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was three levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The lights were dim, and we had one girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who was pregnant, because she came into the picture later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And she was pregnant, and the SS women knew that she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And she gave birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And we all listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And we heard how she cried, and how the baby was delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she delivered it herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And one of the SS women actually helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Then they made a little <span class="DLF">partition</span> , and they put that baby where we could hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And they allowed her to breast feed the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And then, when the baby was two weeks old, they told her, she can't breast feed the baby anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">She had to let the baby die. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And we all died with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean, that was so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We listened, the baby was crying, and crying, and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And no food was given to her, and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And we had to comfort the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We were a lot of women in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But were all like one, all like one. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Now comes the picture, where I -- we were starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We were under-nourished, with rashes on our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We were shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I had a rash that covered my entire body. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I was in agony. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But you can take a lot of pain, when you are young. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Now, the SS women were very cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They were crueler than the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We had -- we did not have a period, because they gave us something in the so-called soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It was given to us once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Even the circumstances that we lived in, we had no periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So that eliminated about how can we protect ourselves, if we don't have a period? </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And they dug a long narrow strip <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , with a board across. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And there were days when it was like 30 below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We had to go and pull our clothing off. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It freezing, just freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But things were so sad that -- we were young, and we sat in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and I sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I sang all kinds of songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And then this SS woman came in, and she says -- she took the black -- I don't know what you call it, but the policemen wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The black stick, the black --
QUESTION:  Nightstick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Yeah, and she beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And she said, "You have it so good that you sing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Because you never answered an SS woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Then she remembered that I sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And every time they took us out to be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And it was beastly cold, in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They counted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They chased us in, back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no matter what they asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Can you sew? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Can you clean? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Can you go there? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Can you go pick up the soup for the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I always went. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Then you be better. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Then you be better than any other prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Maybe there were three or four more. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And then they made the Jewish men into capos. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They called them capos. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they put a band around their arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> as fast as possible, to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That was their pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler said, "We don't have to kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The Jews will kill each other." </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And in circumstances like that, that is exactly what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Those few guys who were the capos, they took a bigger piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us what we were entitled to, because we were so starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We were swollen from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">My legs were twice, three times the size. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And one day, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> further out. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And in order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big kettle, like, where the soup was in, they had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> to reach the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And somebody hollered out to me, "Sonya, I just saw one of your brothers." </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was, one of my brothers, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was the most unbelievable happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And there was this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And she was the meanest, meanest, most horrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She took me and she said again, you have it too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You just made contact with the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I said to her, "This was my brother." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They never hit us in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They always put us against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And then she slammed my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">She knocked my teeth out. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And also you got like a back knock, at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">That was the purpose of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So you get a double pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I just laid there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And it didn't bother her. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And she just walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And she says, " Now you're going to know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And that actually was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That actually was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that they took us out and brought us to an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , where we used to -- it was a huge <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They made the bombs for- the large bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And we were making them. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was upstairs with the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And downstairs were the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And there again, I knew, my God, I was downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I was lucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I was lucky enough that they asked, in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , "Who can speak German fluently?" </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I said, "I can." </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The Hungarian girls came in later on in the War, because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was not jet included. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I relayed the message, what they had to do next, whether he had complaints about anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We couldn't work on those machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They were big, huge machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, they put a white band on my arm, and they always used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German, between the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did not speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And he was actually nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And he threw slices of bread under the machine, as he passed by, because he had to be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Once I got those extra few slices of bread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But how do I get to my brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I cannot go downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the orders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I said to him, "You know what you did was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And being as you are so wonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he says, "Yes, I will. "</span><span class="sentence" id="295">He made me take a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He put it in my arms, and says follow me. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And he got me down to the lower level, where my brother was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And that was called the ; which meant that when the bomb was made upstairs, they had to use very hot ovens, to finish it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120 degrees in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And he stood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I threw that bread under that machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And my brother got the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I did it as often as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But that was still while we were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Now, we were shipped to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  What was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  We didn't know, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And they just sent us to there, through another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which was called ; And that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There was no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">There was just -- every day was elimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They counted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">One, two, three, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">One, two, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">One, four, out, which meant they were going to be burned in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, knowing that at any time they were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And they said to each other, " , which means later. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They are not going to take you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But they didn't say it in that many words. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I figured this was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">How long is this going to last? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Because we were getting less, and less every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They were eliminating, they were killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were awaiting for new shipments. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And also in this shipments (sic.) </span><span class="sentence" id="329">came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They were all told they could take their personal belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Everybody thought they were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing, and maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of the hardest. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Now, we had to go to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we had to -- they had to throw out their belongings, their valise. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis helped themselves to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But they didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I also was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They had a lot of vigor. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They were never afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Before that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , when we were sent out to work, they made contact, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace, a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire -- all of us, coming in from work, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they looked all over and they said, "You will tell us who is bringing in what. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And if you don't, we're going to put you <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and we are going to pour water over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You are going to be on your knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And you will freeze to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We all went out, the way they chased us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He had us on our knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was bitter cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was way below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And they poured pails of water over our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And we froze to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We could not lift our legs up. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But none of us told them who brought that piece of bread in. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">None of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they saw, the following morning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because they saw they were dealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we were still going into work. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were going into, every day, to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Now --
QUESTION:  Was that at the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  It wasn't the first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  It was the one you came to with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Right, that was -- that was . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">No, it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That was . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we had -- now one day, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And myself, two more girls, and three guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Because they thought I brought something into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , like food, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You are going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all the prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one of you, if you date brig anything into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw beet, that we found in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So, it was another miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">As it happened, my brother walked by, and he saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And he knew I was going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But, as luck wanted it, there was an SS man, from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , who came to oversee how they can torture more and take a lesson, the way <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That Latvian SS man knew who I was, that I was in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked him to save me, and somehow it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The others were hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He told the other SS men not to kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And it was like God sent somebody to take this person, to live, which was another miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And they were going to -- they were going to give us a well-known <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , which was -- we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They told us they were going to give us a regular <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We have not had <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> or anything, or toilet paper, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, they chased us into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We were totally naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They put up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fashion show table</span> , like a runway. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we had to walk naked on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And the SS men -- they sat on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and they looked at our bodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I had this horrible rash, that I knew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And I hid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't show how bad it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Then came the other miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And to the right was the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But as they -- as we stood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we didn't know what way they were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We knew they were screaming because they were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And that was with the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It came out of shower heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Later we saw, when the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, there were ten shower heads, many of them over the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And turned on the gas, and by the time they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I peeked 1n, we all peeked in, all of them were dead on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That was a sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That was worse than the ovens, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was going to hit them, until -- just screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They inhaled the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I was saved again. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I was alive, still. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">When we were shipped to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , like I told you before, we did not know when the end was going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But, we did not lose our hopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Because we thought, why isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We thought that President Roosevelt was our savior. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Nobody saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">There was no way for anybody to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And we knew we were going to die, which, at that time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We had no -- nobody, I didn't know, except for the one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We didn't know if they would come out dead or alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But every morning at ten o'clock, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming down, very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And always circling around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which I later found out, that was the American Army, taking pictures, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They knew that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And they were trying to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but to avoid bombing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , which actually was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They did not bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">One day they chased us out, and they said that we had to go and pick something up. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned women who did the food -- picking up the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And as we went to pick up the food, we saw on the other side of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They absolutely devoured it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We grabbed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was pink. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It tasted like the most wonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the hunger alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">How we got that information, we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I don't know how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Now, the SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And there was no radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There were no lights, no radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> like today, with batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So, I entertained the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They wanted somebody to give them music. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, they used to get me out of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And they used to take me in, and put me behind a curtain, or behind a piece of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And I used to stand for them, and sing for them, German songs, which was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I thought it was the greatest thing, because that would give me more life, which it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It actually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It actually -- every, like I said -- every time they counted for the others, they always put me aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But they had no mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what happens, that we are all going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  I am going to go back and ask you some questions from the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You were very young, but do you remember specifically when the first fight -- when you first knew there was fighting going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Tell me what it was like, or what you remember, specifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  I didn't remember it at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">What was devastating for my parents was that the Russians came in the year before the Germans, to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And they immediately took young, strong men, boys, and drafted them, and pushed them into the fighting in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Because the Germans were already coming, towards <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They used to <span class="COUNTRY">Lativia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , for all the killings, because Hitler was under the impression that he was going to end the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And when he wins the War he will say, "I never killed any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The Polacks did, the Latvians did, the Lithuanians did, all the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I never killed anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That was the first thing that was so horrible for my parents, and my sisters, and my other two brothers, to know that we may ever see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And we didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, you were already taken to go to work; is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  The first thing was, they took us from our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and they put us into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  That was the first thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  That was the first thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Do you remember when that was, what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  The very beginning of the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The War broke out in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I was liberated in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">1940, '41 or '40. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I don't remember exactly, because when the Germans came in, they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They chased us out of our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We had no belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And that is when I remember we all lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , horrible things happened, or tell me -- did you know about those things yourself, or were you insulated from knowing, because you were so young, or what did you know, and what did your parents know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  We didn't know much. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We didn't know what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We were just hoping that a miracle was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We did not know that they were actually going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They are actually going to tear us all apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">My two brothers were already gone, with the Russians, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We did not know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">All I know is, when we walked, we walked in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">You were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , because that was too smooth and too good for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So we walked in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> which was many years ago, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It was paved. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">It was big rocks, uneven rocks, that were cemented to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And one day I didn't see it, but I heard that a German SS man named Mengele came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to oversee the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And if he didn't like what you looked like, he took out his gun, and killed everyone that walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So the walking of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to a friend, was really eliminated, because we were afraid that they were going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So, we stayed 1n, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But, morally, I mean we felt, we're together, whatever happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We prayed it would happen to all of us, at the same time, at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But we still didn't believe that it would. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We still didn't believe it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  The ghetto life was not too bad, because it was the very, very beginning, when the German's came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Now <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> itself was a very beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , very beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We had beautiful vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We had beautiful food. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Everybody was employed. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Everybody lived nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we did not have much, because we were taken away our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And we had no clothes to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Whatever we could grab in a little bag, that's what was ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And once we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We only said, please God, let us only be left together. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We did not care what we left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Material things don't mean anything anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">If you fight for life, and the ghetto life was not- it horrible, but it wasn't -- because we didn't believe it was going to get any worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We felt, oh, this is going to be our punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And after that, the War will be over, and we will be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And once we are saved, like -- we are young enough to build a life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And my parents were too, because my mother, like I said, was 49, and my father was 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They worked -- my father worked, he took care of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  About how long before -- were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> before you were deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  I think the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> thing was very short, well, maybe six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Because they needed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to bring the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , to eliminate the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And they didn't want to do their killing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So, then we walked from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to these concentrated places, to serve them jobs like I told you where we lived, all day long there, they took a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and from the bottom to the very top, which was the six or seven stories high, was --one was the place where they made the boots for the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">One was a place where they made fur jackets for the Nazis' girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">One was a place where they made dresses for the Nazis' wives and girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And on top was one where they were making shoes, ladies' shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And anyone who had a trade was lucky, because they were used. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But luckily, like I told you, when you are young enough, and you have a lot of guts, which I did, I told them I could sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I did know how to sew, because when I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they taught us how to sew, like they do here, too, I understand, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But you are under pressure, of the necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You are the best -- it is the best teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">You learn an awful lot, even things you don't know how to do, you learn how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And it was a big help. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And then they couldn't keep us in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , which was not really <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because if 1t was or , , or . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And there's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They were all on the outskirts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because, like I said, when the War would have been over, and Hitler would have won, he would have said he did not kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So, that's what it's all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">That's why when I went yesterday to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> , it was very, very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But by the same token, I was very, very thrilled to see young kids, because <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  When you were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and there were actions --

<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  Tell me what you saw, or what you heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  What it was, it was actually -- they used to take a gaggle of people, in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they just were shooting them, and making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> more available for the next shipments. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So, I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">What I didn't see, I heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And if I listened, I heard the screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So, you are always -- and you still didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">You still didn't think- you were very fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">You were very careful, not to expose yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But, how can you not hear? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">How can you not see? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">If one was saved, if one person was -- they didn't shoot, and he survived, he told it to us, what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And there was not people who were any different than you and I. It was just that they happened to be picked out, taken in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and just shooting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And that was their biggest pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They did 1t with so much, with so much -- they were actually happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They were -- when I saw Sophie's choice, I realized how great the movie was made, because they did it with a lot of love, although they tell you today that they were assigned to do the job, and they followed instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They Latvians loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And the Germans loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They did it with a lot of pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And they were not, as far as I'm concerned, I could not believe the German people could do such a thing, because they were very cultured people, very intelligent people, very clean people, to become such murderers. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And the Hitler Youth, little boys, 13 years old, 14 years old, they were just as poisoned as a 40 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They took their guns and they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, as long as you were Jewish -- they got any kind of a Jew, even if you were a quarter of a Jew, and eighth of a Jew, they killed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was something that is indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">You can't really -- to this day, I can't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It's unbelievable, that people can do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  I had one girlfriend in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">She was from -- she was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And luckily we were always -- we became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Luckily we were always shipped to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And we were even choosing our -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when we came in, we chose the upper level of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , because it had a little light there. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And we also had no control over our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We were so weak, that some of the elderly people, the elderly women used to urinate and it just came down onto us, so we made up, we were going up to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So nobody would do anything on top of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But we befriended each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And we still keep in touch, and she did not know that I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I did not know that she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And the overall, the woman all were very civil to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">The only time we became animals was when our piece of bread was given to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Then we became animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But otherwise, we had actually -- did not approach each other by name, as much, because there were lots of them that were from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And you have to shift for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Whatever you did, you had to shift for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But I made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And I have some of them, to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">That I speak to my girlfriend, who landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mexico City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I speak to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We keep in touch with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And we even arranged to go away together, on vacation, so we would be without husbands, and be by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">That was very important, to have somebody left, who has been through the same as you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Because that person is the most compassionate person to you, and me to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  And when you were there, was that friendship -- did that friendship help you get through, from one <span class="NPIP">day</span> to another?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">In a way, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We always hung on together for the coping, because they watched us constantly, as though we could go someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And they also -- the day we walked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , she was not as badly infected as I was, with the body rash, and she was walking step into step, and covering my -- the front of my body, so the SS men would not put me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">For whatever, we knew it was for death. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We knew it wasn't for anything but death. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">By her covering me, I think it saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So, we went to the left, she went to the left, and the others went to the right, which was to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  There was some sort of an incident when you were selected, and you escaped by hiding, by crawling into a <span class="DLF">gutter</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Well, that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We had heard that the American Army -- they are at the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And we had all the time <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They were flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And if they were giving one or two it meant that everybody had to turn their lights off in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the people who lived there, because they did not want to be killed by the bombs of the Americans, or whoever came across. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I personally feel that if the War would have lasted another 10 days, we all would have been dead, because it was the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , as far as the hunger, and the sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So, now we hear a five alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And with that five alarm the <span class="DLF">gates</span> opened up, and the SS women and the SS men ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So, we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But immediately after that -- a little while after that, and the <span class="DLF">gates</span> are open, and we went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was very bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And we knew that the Americans were not there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it was flat to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was bombed out, the <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> were bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And we opened up a little <span class="DLF">opening</span> there, a little rock or two rocks, and we crawled into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of that bombed out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we were about nine or twelve of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Once we got in there, now there was a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">What are we going to do about eating, if it lasts another few days, before the Americans come in? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The first thing I did -- we did, is as we were crawling in there we saw about -- I don't know how many feet away it was, one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- a little <span class="BUILDING">building</span> remained, and it was not bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">cleaning store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So, my brothers broke the <span class="DLF">window</span> down, and the other guys, and got the clothing from the <span class="BUILDING">cleaning store</span> , and we eliminated our striped clothes, and put on the clothes that didn't fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But it did not matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And while we were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , we had heard that the Americans were already in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so we took up the guys to walk out, and walk in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And as we walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , American soldiers came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And they saw that we were shaved, and the men wore -- they called it , which was skinny bodies, skinny arms, and fat legs from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And one was a German Jew, who was an officer 1n the American Army, and he said to us, what language do you speak, in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Naturally, we all jumped on him, because we all spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And he immediately organized for the soldiers to go back to their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where they were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And within half and hour or so, they brought us all their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I hadn't brushed my teeth for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I mean he did not eat -- now I know it was a big Hershey bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And you know how it is cut? </span><span class="sentence" id="760">We ate little crumbs of it, so it would last longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And -- before we walked out, the German found out that there were Jews hiding in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Now we hear them. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And how can we hide from them? </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So, it was like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span> , with steps originally going up, and underneath 1s always a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And we all crawled into that <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And we did not breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So the did not hear us. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And they said in German, "We knew there are Jews here, but where are they?" </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And they walked out, luckily. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And when we walked out, we met the American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Now, the rest of our group found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is empty, but there is some food, some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So they went back there to get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And they were caught, because the Nazis came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was not quite over. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I told my brothers, we are not going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We are staying right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who we were with, because they thought the war was still not over. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">That particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was not liberated for them, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And we'll be walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot, because that would kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we were so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I did it for my brothers, as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them overate. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They ate too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes, which was like cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we tried to find the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And start to work for papers, to go someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Because we didn't want to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The memories were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were bloody. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">There was no need to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">So, we arranged it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , do you think it was easier for women, than men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  That's a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It was only easier if you were young enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Because they eliminated anything under 13, and over 30 were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I shall also never forget, in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latvian concentration camp</span> , a few of the mothers had their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">They were like ten years old, nine years old, five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And then they came one day and said, "We are going to take your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We are going to take them to a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they are going to be given more things than you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So we are going to put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And we are going to ship them over to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And the mothers, and we all knew it was for death. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Now, these mothers -- I had a friend that I knew through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , she had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They actually hung onto those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> -- it was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They piled them up, standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They were hanging on, to whatever they could hang on. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And they were dragged along, until they had no more strength, and their arms couldn't hold them up, and they fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , because they knew their children were going to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And these children were crying, screaming for their parents, crying for their mothers. "</span><span class="sentence" id="825">Mama, mama, please, save me." </span><span class="sentence" id="826">You know, it was -- it was -- 1t was just horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And they were eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And they eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They kept on eliminating, over 30 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They had one young boy who went through the whole thing with us, and we all saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">When they counted us, we shoved him -- he was little, we shoved him between us, we covered him with our upper parts of our jackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And then, when we had to go anywhere, the mother of this child somehow or other, she sewed up -- you know our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> -- we had a straw covered with burlap. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">That was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And we helped her take that burlap and sew it up, and she covered him, and pretended it was like sugar, or flour, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And it was her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He was the only child that we saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He is still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  How long was he hidden there, with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  He was hidden with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He was like a big, big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Because they escaped taking him, plain as day. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">When they took the children away, somehow or other, they didn't get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">When all these kids were shipped away, and they were all killed, and he was the only child, we found later on, was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we weren't going to let him die. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So, we all fought for his life, and he survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  Did you hide him during the day, when you guys went off to work; or was this when you weren't going to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  We were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We were hiding him. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Somehow or other, he was hiding under the last -- the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So we were hiding him there, and wherever -- wherever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">There's a lot to say about people who go through horrors, how your mind works, how you really can do -- like the day when they were sending all -- there was another incident when they were sending everybody somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And they were counting everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And there was a <span class="DLF">drain</span> , where the water runs down? </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I left myself -- I put myself into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I lifted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I don't even know how I was able to lift up that <span class="DLF">iron drain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And I put myself, my body, into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I held on to the -- to those tron things, and I saved myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Because, your mind is -- it's the animal instinct, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">If you want to live, that you can use so much imagination, to really save yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">There are so many things -- I mean there were so many things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">There was a man -- the oldest one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And he was -- also he played, he was a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I think he was a cellist, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they beat the hell out of him, the Jewish guy, the one that wore the thing on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">He couldn't get off his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , to go to be counted, because he was so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">He was only 50 years old, and he was the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So, he Absolutely -- they beat him, with that black police stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And he crawled out to be counted, because 1f you wouldn't -- because if the number would be off, then we would be killed, at least 10 of us, for one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">How -- you couldn't escape, but they would say, where is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="871">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So, the men dragged him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We weren't counted together. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">To say it was easier for a woman than for a man, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I think it was equally as hard, because -- very, very- it is actually up to the individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where we were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were made, there was a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">He was my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And he turned out- he is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">He is a violinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">He plays every instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And he was little enough, and I was little enough and they used to give us great food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It was farina. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And farina was cooked for 250 people, in one big kettle. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">It was about seven feet tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So in order to clean that, you have to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">So, my main friend, at that time we were not being together, but we still had a little contact in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So, he used to clean the inside of the pot, and I used to clean the outside of the pot, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And it was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And we had an , what they called . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">He was the main -- the manager of the entire thing, the SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">He was more than an ordinary SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">He had a higher rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He was the main man. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And all of a sudden, we hear screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And he brings 1n this guy, puts him in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and shoots him, kills him. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">That was so strange to us, because that was the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we were working at, and going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And we couldn't ask him, why did you kill him? </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He felt like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">He found him and he wasn't working at that moment, so he took him to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and he killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And that was for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And he was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He was a nice SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">He wasn't so bad, because he had -- and you want to hear the best? </span><span class="sentence" id="906">When the War was over, he said, when the Americans liberated us, he said he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="908">He lived for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And when they asked him how could you be Jewish?

"</span><span class="sentence" id="947">How could you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="948">How can you go and see it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I said, "Did you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="950">She says, "Not yet, because I don't like to see sad things." </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I said, "How can you be so selfish. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">It isn't that sad, to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And how can you ignore something of history? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">The world should know and you don't want to see it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And they all went.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  What kind of songs did you sing then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  I sang modern German songs, cheerful songs that they wanted to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And that was part of their pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">What was going on behind the curtain from -- I mean that was hiding me, I never looked, because I wasn't interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I wasn't supposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">But I know that is the way they entertained the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I want you to know one more thing, how sick these women were, these SS women were. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">That when we were running out to run away, we had to pass their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , where they were situated. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And quickly, very quickly we ran through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">There were some photographs and we grabbed it and we ran with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And they always had dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">They always -- every SS man had a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Every SS woman had a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">When they walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they always had a dog, because -- I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Then we saw pictures that they actually photographed their sexual satisfaction with a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">That is how sick they were, which was not too clear to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But later on 1t was explained to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And I also remember one more thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">My husband and I went to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And we went to visit friends, relatives, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And our trip was scheduled with a stop in . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">But somehow or other we had to land in , either to refuel or I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But they didn't want to keep us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And they wanted us to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , and then come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And then they will fly us where were supposed to fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And I looked out of the little <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and I saw a black raincoat, belted, black, long, with a big German Shephard. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And it was a policeman, a German policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And I actually lost my -- I felt like I was going through an emotional horror, because they looked exactly, exactly like the Nazis did, during the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And I said to my husband, "I am not getting off." </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And he said, "Why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And I said, "I am afraid." </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He said, "What are you afraid of?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I said, "Take a look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">They look the same, just like the murderers." </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So, the fact remains that it is not easy to go through life, to have experienced what we experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And I am grateful, for myself, as well as for all the other survivors, that some of us survived to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">To me, this is the biggest, the best thing that could have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">QUESTION:  We have just a couple of minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Now, did you also sing in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you and the other prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">That is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">That's how the SS woman knew that I did, because I sang, we sang together, we sang apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We taught each other songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We put songs together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">We had to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">We did it and that is how the SS woman knew that I could sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">She had no other knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And that is when she started to send for me, to come to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she was living, that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to entertain her gentlemen, the SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">They were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">They were very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">But unfortunately I heard that some of the SS women pulled the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">They said that they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Because they know everything that went on, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And they had no -- there was no proof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">How can you prove you are not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I mean a German girl -- the SS women looked like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They were dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They were light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">They were blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">There was no stamp on them, I am German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">They looked the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">As far as I'm concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And as far as anyone 1s concemed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They look the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">That is why I can never tell apart, to this day, whether this person is Jewish or not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">It really doesn't matter to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">It has no meaning to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I have very, very good friends who are not Jewish, and I cherish them, and I respect them, and I love them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So, during the War, before the War broke out, we had very dear friends who were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And they used to see us walking in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , like horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And they couldn't even look at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">They were afraid to look at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">They didn't want to let on that they knew us, because it could have been hard too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Knowing a Jew was a criminal thing.</span></p>
