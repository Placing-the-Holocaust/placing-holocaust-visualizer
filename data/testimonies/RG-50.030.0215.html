<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Jerry Slivka.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born July 11, 1915 in the <span class="REGION">Western Ukraine</span> , which was at that time Czarist Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Jerry, can you tell me something about your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, uh I...my father was born same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother was born in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I had uh two sisters and two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was a uh I don't know if you know what it means...kind of a muscue (ph)...1t was a modern, self-taught Hebrew scholar. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He also had like myself had the affinity for languages, uh nat...nat...natural ability I should say, and he, before the war, before the 1st World War, he used to teach uh the Polish children of Polish nobility who lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , were the the owners of the large <span class="DLF">estates</span> , the Poles, and he used to teach their children Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Self-taught...himself...taught himself Polish and German, and he also was a Hebrew teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In those days it was a very rare thing to teach modern Hebrew, because most of Jewish education was the , <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was one of the first to pioneer, taught modern Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War, in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for about a year so Sov...the <span class="REGION">Czarist Russia</span> and Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">That <span class="REGION">sector</span> , that section of the of the front, 1t was manned by the Austrians and it so happened that Hungarians...the Austra-Hungarian empire so there were lots of Hungarians there too, and Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh when I was about five months old they evacuated us to the rear, the Germans did. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The...at that time it was the Hungarian, the Austria-Hungarian army, and we were uh from 1915, beginning of 1916, we were about forty, fifty kilometers in the rear on this of the of the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended, we came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was almost uh totally demolished and there was nothing to do there, so my father moved to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh the Polish government was just established. </span><span class="sentence" id="20"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became independent in 1918 and my father knowing Polish got a job as the mana...office manager in the Polish uh county county seat. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That way he worked for a couple of years till the Poles started settling that that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because there were no Poles, very few Poles there, and they got a lot of Polish-speaking Poles and my father was fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh this was about 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">At that time the new Soviet army occupied, advanced all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They went by us and uh it was a very difficult time because there was also many Ukrainian uh independence groups trying to establish an independent Ukraine, and among them were many bands of anti- Semitic uh armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There was Batura (ph), and there was Bela and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the , and uh we became, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became a normal so-called democratic country. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as being built. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh my father went into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish courts</span> in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> or any other Polish authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I grew up uh in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And uh I stayed there for a year or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That's that's while, you know, didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> or we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">One day I remember my father went for , went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> which was about six kilometers away and I I was probably four or five years old and I ran after the realize it that he sneaked out I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He didn't want...1t was expensive to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They had to go through a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">There were wolves in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him. (</span><span class="sentence" id="42">Laughter) So I grew up in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Then my father went to as I told you before, and he didn't do badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was...he had a uh <span class="BUILDING">military garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The the the terrain around our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was swampy and and lot lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh my father used to have a uh <span class="BUILDING">beer parlor</span> like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He also had a kind of a so-called <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> -like which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, died, the leader of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  we've talked a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I would like to know about you as a young boy growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go, what.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, I went, as I told you before, first of all my father taught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Later on there were others. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">When he went to business, there were other teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">One of them particular influenced my life very greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">His name was Moshi . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He was a modern Hebrew teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He taught me everything, you know, all...my my rounded education all in Hebrew, so I learned Hebrew quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Uh but it was compulsa...this was...this was <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were not recognized by the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They were uh...we, we ourselves organized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You know, we used to hire our teacher and this was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , probably about forty Jewish families, so we we were compelled to to attend the <span class="BUILDING">Polish grammar school</span> , which in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> went only to the fourth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">In bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> it went to the seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And and and I was very advanced for that kind of education, you see, except in Polish, which I learned, but I mean uh math and all the other subjects I learned already when I was five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I had to learn , SOI I....1 went up through the fourth grade and later on my parents enrolled me into a uh <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which is <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh it was operated by the network of <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> , Zionist Hebrew...Hebrew language teaching Hebrew uh teaching Hebrew in ; which is uh about thirty kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And again I stayed with a family which was uh very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with four kids and I was with them and my uh mother used to send me every week uh freshly baked , pastry and butter and all this stuff and I managed by myself as so. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I entered...I took an exam and entered the third class. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">This was a uh...well, this was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> up to the eighth...you graduated uh matriculated uh in eight eight classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I entered in the third, but they were very expensive and at that time my father's business went down and he could not afford to pay and after a year my younger brother was ready to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He wanted him to get a little bit of education, so I was...I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my younger brother, second brother, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So my formal education ended there. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I still had the same teacher we had before for about a year and a half, till about my thirteenth year, thirteen, fourteen years old and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That that's where my formal education ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I tried of course all the time to upgrade my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I I taught myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I read a lot and this teacher helped me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh at that time it was a very difficult...what do when you are fourteen or fifteen? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And we had some, I had friends...well, my age probably we had a group of about ten kids, boys and girls, and we organized a uh group. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Originally it was , a leftist Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Later on the majority thought that this was too too leftist for them, and we organized a , which was the revisionist group and then uh there was nothing to do in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so at age sixteen I decided to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So we went but at that time it was the most famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh not enough to eat, lots of work and I stayed there for a few months and then one of my friends tried to leave and he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and while going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he stopped in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He lived a little further and he told my parents about the conditions in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So they decided that I should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So they wrote me a letter where my mother is very sick (laughter) and I should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Thank God she was not sick and I didn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Besides you had to wait...1t was not so much the hard work and the lack of food, but you might have to wait two years, three years, before you get a certificate, you know, to go to...it was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was nothing to do in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so my parents decided to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My mother had a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So I went there and my uncle had a little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> but I wasn't interested too much in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="97"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was the industrial capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Had a great textile industry and Jews were uh dominated the small <span class="BUILDING">textile businesses</span> , uh manufacturing sweaters, uh socks, uh gloves, these kind of...the large <span class="BUILDING">textile mills</span> , even though some of them were owned by Jews, had no Jewish employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They had non-Jewish employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It was so- called which was owned by a Jew named Cohen (ph) who was, by the way, a Hasid (ph), a very religious Jew and there was who built great <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> for Polish people, but for the Jews he built a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , for Jews that could not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There was strong unions there, Polish nationalist unions, even socialist unions were very much against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| went to __ <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for a few months and I learned making sweaters, and I used to stay there for a few months, earn enough to get a ticket to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> (laughter) for this...you know the season was uh summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Middle summer and late fall and then there was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">These were small...people that lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and had a...two or three machines, hand-operated sweater making machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That's what I did for a few years and uh this was known...you know what means? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And that's the way life was till 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in '38 and stayed till 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">In 1930...by went from , from the extreme right to a leftist organization called the Anti*Fascist Front. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I didn't know at that time that it was dominated by the , the communist youth organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Later on the Communist Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was uh dissolved by Stalin but this group...the the uh the Communist Youth Organization was instructed to infiltrate other organizations, regardless right or left. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I didn't....was not exactly uh you know, convinced of communism because I was still, I still had Zionist inclinations. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I couldn't understand why Hebrew language which was near and dear to me should be banned, which was banned by the Communist Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Uh many other things which I could not understand of course at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I understand it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And uh so I joined that group till I find out that they were...this was just a uh arm of the Communist Youth movement so I left them but I had some idea about the Communist uh Marxism, Communism, Leninism, so forth, the way it was then...you know, it changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Especially lately. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and in 1939 when the Soviet Union occupied this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...the Germans occupied the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...I uh became active in the local the uh well cultural Communist uh leadership of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I got ...as a as a result of this I got the job as the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">village store</span> and it lasted till 1941 when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  The Soviet occupation was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We didn't feel it so much in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because there were no no bourgeois, no no people that were sent away but there were Poles that lived around, settlers. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were not native to this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> settled them there after 1918, 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">These were participants in the Polish war for independence, in the Ist World War, and they awarded...they gave them parcels of <span class="REGION">land</span> to to work and there were they were called <span class="REGION">colonies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They were not called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They were called <span class="REGION">Polish colonies</span> and one night they called me and , cold...1t was a very cold winter in 1939-40. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They called us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> uh , well the the uh the local the local the local authorities and uh I saw a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was not even a yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">This was still still uh privately owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They called them all . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were sitting there was a some people from the NKBD in charge of this and they told us...uh first of all they screened everyone of us and said can you, can you spend the night, can you spend the morning and so forth, and when they came to me I told them I can't... have to be in the morning in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> because I have to distribute bread and there was...aga...again a <span class="BUILDING">military garrison</span> there which we supplied with bread, their families would buy bread, and I had to be there in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I I smelled there was something wrong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">In the morning when I woke up I saw hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> taking away these Polish families from all around, from the whole <span class="REGION">region</span> , uh loading them into into uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh they had, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> to heat...not like the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">By by the way, I think that Hitler learned from Stalin how to how to do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, __ but originally it was tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our <span class="REGION">region</span> , Poles, and sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Also some of the former Communist leaders were arrested and you know, it was kind of uh the same thing I think that is going on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They they...( ) I know, but but there is there is a common thread there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh whoever had some grudge against somebody else, they denounced them and they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I know a very good friend of mine was...a Ukrainian, not a Jew, Ukrainian...leader of the , Spent probably about four or five years in Polish jails for being a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The Communist Party was illegal in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he was sent away to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , together with these Poles, the same night. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But we didn't have...there weren't very many rich Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">sent away, most of...in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> they sent away all these rich Jews...(laughter) you know, a small manufacturers, small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> owners, they sent him away, doing him a favor by the way because most of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Most of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Some died from hunger, starvation but some survived, so it was not as... had it very well, you know, I I had a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I had no problems, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Whatever came in I could have...the the...there wasn't much available but there was bread, you see, and there was sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Sugar was a luxury item, but the little I got, you know, first of all I my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My father worked as the uh accountant at the regional uh group in the same organization...the uh cooperatives, village cooperatives, and my brother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When I when I left, he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and he somehow got established with my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He managed his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">This uncle of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> didn't speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You know, for for hundreds of years....he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but he did not speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And my brother managed his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He was manufacturing uh locks for women's pocketbooks, and he kept the books and delivered __ the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">He employed about four or five people there, but when the war...when the Germans occupied, he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There were, you know, thousands and thousands who left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bork</span> (ph), and came the German or Soviet authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So uh it was difficult but it was bearable to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">To us it was...I even believed some of their slogans, see, about uh rights of minorities, because the left persecuted the Jews, Jews couldn't a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the Polish uh from 1920 till 1939 uh there

Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And here the Soviet Union came in and to calling somebody a dirty, you know, Jew or kike (ph)...it was fifteen years in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">This was Stalinism, and so so uh it was kind of...we didn't realize then what was going on in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Of course there were millions already sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Millions dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There was there was cannibalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But we didn't know that... to us this was ideal. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It took us some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In 1941, when the war started between...the the Germans...the the...Hitler's forces attacked the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We were about uh forty kilometers from the <span

called to reserve training, for about four or six weeks I was already at that time twenty-six. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They took me for a few weeks into a unit which watched enemy war...uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">enemy aircraft</span> , in training, of course, because nobody expected a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">This was about the middle of June, June 10th or 12th, somewhere along there . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">| was stationed at the same in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">These people would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for meals and uh one day, on June 22nd, I happened to be on watch in a tall <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I was standing there with binoculars watching for enemy craft, and sure enough I saw enemy craft...I saw the German Mescherschmidts (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They were flying on their way back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They had already bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> , the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and on the way back they dropped a few bombs in our...at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , not aiming at anything, just to create a little bit of panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And when I called the <span class="BUILDING">center</span> to tell them ...1t was an old fashioned field telephone...you crank it...and I called that this wasn't the uh <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was ___ here, and I called them and told them that I think I saw (laughter) I saw enemy craft and that they bombed our <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="187">Laughter) He says is that so. . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They knew already , and so he asked me what kind of it was and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He said well, we were attacked by the Fascists and this is war. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We saw a few more...within the next few days we saw a few more uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German aircraft</span> flying over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They didn't do any damage bombs, but within a week or so we could hear artillery...uh noise of artillery shells, in the distance of about twenty or thirty kilometers, and that meant that was retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So with my unit...uh I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We didn't know how long it will last, heroic Red army will not let uh the occupy. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It just, you know, happened in the beginning they didn't expect it was, you know, we'll get it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">No question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We will be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> probably within...the same the same thought was in '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I I...a funny thing...in the Polish...I was also mobilized in the Polish Army doing the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was not the army, but it was like a national guard...uh we watched for for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They never occupied until then. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So we retreated, and we kept retreating and the further east we went, the further east the Germans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They they put...they dropped parachute drops ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Great panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Small groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Uh the Russians were not prepared war. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They told, you know, they they killed the great generals and others killed , SO they were without a uh higher uh staff of skilled officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They had to train new ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They were unprepared and we thought that this was an army that cannot be defeated but they didn't have to fight uh <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was of course done in seventeen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we saw these big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , the the all the equipment they had, which we did not see in the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Of course we didn't realize what the German army had, so the further we went the further they advanced, till finally we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we we couldn't go any further, but somehow we got out and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> (ph), and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> they assigned me and a few others to to another unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It was a uh machine gun unit in in <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The...about twenty, thirty kilometers from <span

<span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> with machine guns in them, and they they had a garrison of about ten thousand people in it, with a commissioned officer and non-commissioned officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We were supposed to It was camouflaged with a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , so when they looked from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , they saw the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The Germans were just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , about half a mile away, so then they saw us...and they're not supposed to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We had <span class="DLF">trenches</span> built from the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> but one day they uh a few artillery shells they demolished the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">There was the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> (laughter) in its full glory standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And uh we stayed there for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I happened to be elected the uh the editor of the unit newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> has every every every <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> uh the commercial or military uh etiquette, used to have a war paper, paper that was, you know, the praise those who did good work and criticize those who did bad work, and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I didn't know in the beginning what it was, so I wrote articles about the glorious Soviet army and Stalin and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Finally, they called me and told me this, this is not...Pravda will take care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">You write who in the unit learned to shoot better than _, who has been falling asleep on the...one day I did fall asleep, but . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Uh so they...every so often I used to be called to conferences that the , the political uh comman..the political officer of the units, which was in, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">One day they called me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They told me to take my rifle, whatever I had...I didn't have much...and report to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of this...it was a...called...1t was the nineteen, twenty-ninth uh independent battalion, machine gun battalion, to report to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in the rear and I did report there and they took me in to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> there and there I found some uh neighboring...uh one fellow I knew which was not , was a Jewish fellow from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near us and I found there many others, Jews and Ukrainians who were from the so- called <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> , that were born, or lived...not just born...lived in in the Soviet...the <span class="REGION">territory</span> that was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, and they took us on the front, with the purpose of putting us in work battalion, because they trust us. . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The irony of the thing was was that the native Ukrainian soldiers that lived around the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , they deserted by the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We did not, especially Jews, because we knew where we going to <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You know, if we fall into German hands we'll be dead, so we stayed to the last man, and we came uh...they took us on the front and again we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> and within two days that <span class="REGION">territory</span> was occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were in...uh it was September I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">September '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> and two days later the Germans came in and and happened by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They didn't stay long. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Right away they organized the Ukrainian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There there was no lack of collaborators, and they killed a hundred thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I left two days before then with the work battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we we we traveled thousands, hundreds of thousands of people...there were uh Jews, Ukrainians, uh Poles and Germans, Soviet Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Germans that lived in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Uh one...the the commander of my group was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I still remember his name...Weiss (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He was an officer in the Red Army, taken to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Not trust-worthy, and I was the only one in the unit that had a pocket watch, and he asked...he found out that I had a watch and he asked me for the watch because he had to know when to stop to _ food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was no no andI lostmy watch _—s because we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Germans bombed us and we we disintegrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Everyone just ran wherever he could, and my friend Weiss with my watch disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He probably surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Till we came uh we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I made a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">One Jewish boy from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from us and we stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Just tried to find somebody to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Then we joined...we joined a group...no. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We came we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I'll never forget the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And there we closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We couldn't go any further, and it was Rosh Hashanna. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Never forget that date...it was 19...still 1941, and we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the Germans were all around us and they started shooting and we were hiding in a <span class="DLF">field</span> of uh...what do you call it... what the plant is called...they are tall stocks like....yeah...and we were heading there, hiding there, and there were uh people fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They...probably half of us fell...before they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And there was a lot of Jewish soldiers fell work battalions who came from our section of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> , Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And some of them had...they were allegedly had prayer books and they sat in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I I saw some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with wounded soldiers and I I don't know what happened to me...my friend who is now...I don't know if he is still alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ...he got __ got sick...he got Parkinson's disease but Isaw____ but at that time he was sitting and I tried to help this wounded soldier get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He reminded me of my . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">All of a sudden you I don't think of it as just stupid, but I I tried to help other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">This trait remains with me to this day, and at that time...the next morning...at night the Germans didn't fight...and the next morning we decided, tried to decide what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Then we saw a group of uh Soviet sailors...not the sea sailors...they had a group...they had a unit of uh river sailors, marching in formation, trying to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">The only way...it seemed there was a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> which the Germans did not control, and they walked right into this <span class="DLF">swamp</span> and I and my friend followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">When the Germans saw people in the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> they started shooting from uh _ artillery shells you know, makes a uh big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and it explodes uh not...what you call this...straight ahead... not because if you lie down you can, you know, even if it goes near you uh you're still safe, but uh most of the explosions are _ killed _, especially in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , so there were lots of people killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">One thing I have to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">When I when I was walking through this <span class="DLF">swamp</span> I suffered before...I didn't have a I didn't have a spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I lost my spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">A soldier without a spoon because they used to give us to feed us with a big kind of...well... a container with soup for ten people, and if you had a spoon, you ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It not you had to wait till somebody gives you his spoon after he ate, but by now it was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And while walking I saw a spoon...these were wooden spoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The Russian still use them...a wooden spoons...floating you know, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I picked up the spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I didn't care , but then I mean I couldn't _____. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Picked up that spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I had it for a long time, and when we crossed that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and this friend of mine he's you know a good swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I was not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">we uh we used to have these things around our feet inthe army to__, you know, to wrap them all around your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I had a pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We put them together and uh put out, all our clothes...outer clothes...uh great coats wrapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We had some food and cigarettes and uh he swam over and then he pulled me over with this here and we came on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and there we landed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .... The minute we we we crossed, we swam over that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I decided to have a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Not food but a cigarette, smoke it, and I took a puff and at this.... I wouldn't be there, I probably would have stayed there, but he , and he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was burning so we used the fire to dry our clothes and uh the next morning...then we went to a uh big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we slept in the hay till the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The next morning we went down and we saw thousands of Russian soldiers, without without officers, without...not organized units. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">All, every everybody and quickly there were a few officers and we decided that if we encountered some Germans, we'll fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We had we had a one rifle between us and some grenades and they gave us when we was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Gave us back our . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We decided to fight 1f we saw a small group of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">If not we will scatter and hid and there were again these tall uh .... can't remember the name of that uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> and uh and sure enough when we were talking organizing there's one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with Germans, German soldiers, that they... machine guns on it, and they're already leading a procession of prisoners of war and they motioned to us to come to surrender and the majority did. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The majority surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We, being Jewish, knew that this means certain death, so we headed out to the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">This friend of mine but then a small uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> came, and they circled that because they didn't drive into the _. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were afraid to drive in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , but they circled 1t and whoever got up...and there were a lot of us still hidden...whoever got up and surrendered, they shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They didn't take any more prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We did not . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They circled it and left, left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We got out and then we found a few more Russian...Soviet officers and we joined them and we were a welcomed addition to their group because by knowing Yiddish...I speak a little German too and I understand German quite well...uh they, they used to send us out uh scouting whenever we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So we traveled for about six weeks...the real uh German forces...uh at night we would sleep somewhere _. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Of course first we had to find out if they are friendly or unfriendly Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They, they knew, these officers knew where _ and uh at night, at night we we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">In the daytime we would stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">One uh...1n every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> we approached they used to send us to find out if German . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">One night we came to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we came to...at the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we knocked on the <span class="DLF">window</span> and a woman came out, a peasant woman, and she grabbed us like this...you've gotten . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And she came out and she says, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is full of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They are soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is full of Germans already. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">This...where's their guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He is sitting there over this rifle asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So of course we could have uh thrown a grenade in there and killed them all, but we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The family would have been killed, and besides the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was full of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They would (laughter) capture us in no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we slowly retreated and stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> till we went all around and came to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And we were like this we traveled for about I suppose about six weeks, till the one point we crossed a a point where the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the that changed hands several times the last few days, and we crossed a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there and we came out and this was...I still remember...I I remember the date because it was uh the Russian revolution date, of the Russian...November 7th. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We crossed and we we found the Russian sentry standing sleeping so we woke him up but and he told us where the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> are. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We came there, and there they took us and sent us again to work battalions. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">That's a whole long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Took us...they took us to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> uh and we dug anti...anti-tank ditches. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It was already winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was frozen probably six feet and there was six feet cover of snow and we cleared the snow, dug the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The the Germans never crossed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They went all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Was a waste of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Uh with very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We stayed in <span class="BUILDING">peasants' houses</span> worked together all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We stayed there for a few months till spring and in the spring they took us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there they were building a railroad between...uh started between...on the other side of the —_, from , from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Caspian Sea</span> , all the way past...I can't remember now the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Four hundred kilometers of railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There was no railroad on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Balkan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The Germans already occupied the <span class="REGION">territory</span> , uh the <span class="REGION">west side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This was the eastern side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Balkan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And then they built a railroad and this was administered by the MKBD, the uh prison authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And the workers were prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We were work battalions but under their jurisdiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So my friend and I were picked to guard <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , which was a very cushey job. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">rifle watch this would be free in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not too many men, mostly women, but you got some food __. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Then one day there was a quarrel between the MKBD and the military uh don't make the __ by building that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and we stayed _ guards. . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">This was a very difficult job because it was all done by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Uh the <span class="REGION">territory</span> there, the the topography, it's flat so we had to dig, you know, on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> there and make a...how do you call it when you make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> ...a trestle...the the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">high mountain</span> like...all by hand, yes, we did it by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">There was one of the uh KPDB colonels used to come and inspect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Happened to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">His

was aviation oil, aviation uh fuel...uh leaked into the soil, sandy soil, so they used the Jews to squeeze out that oil, that fuel from from the soil and turn it over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Now the Jews had the opportunity to steal some of it and trade it with the peasants for food, so for a year they lived not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Although here and there they would kill a Jew or beat up...my brother was beaten up, my father was beaten up, but it was not so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They didn't know what's going on in the whole world, or the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> even, but there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They could move _ and they lived not bad with this, you know, relatively not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Uh 1940, until 19...till 1942, for a whole year and then in '42 uh they heard rumors that the nearby city of —__, which had a population of about twenty thousand Jews, was burned in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , here and there somebody will escape and you know, word gets around, so a group of young people decided to leave the <span

class="sentence" id="567">So they made some make-shift arms...uh board uh which uh spring that would fire a bullet if you could find one. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Probably would kill you

they organized a group to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , uh get some arms so they can go to the peasants and terrorize them into giving them some food, , get some food and about...over twenty left. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Half of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Among them were my two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They left the night before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They...there was no <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="577">They brought in all the gypsies they could find into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Uh they brought in all the Jews that lived in little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , one family, two families they brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Some they killed right there, but the majority they brought and put into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they knew already that something 1s happening, so the night before before it happened...it was on a Friday, twenty-three days a week before Rosh Hasshannan. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Uh my friend...friend of mine who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> told me this story...came to urge my brothers to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They planned it before, but they couldn't leave the family and they felt you know they are abandoning the...my two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">One of my sisters was called to white-wash the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> which was a big, tall you know, high ceiling and she fell and broke her leg so she couldn't even move. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And my father, when he tried to convince them not to let let us...we are young...maybe we will survive somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So my mother went and two of my brothers...we also had a cousin that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to the next guard a peasant of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that she knew...you knew, you know everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And she gave him some uh warm clothes that we still have left, you know, fur-lined jackets...not not mink but sheepskin uh and he he let them through. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He let them through. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He could have uh he could have killed them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Now take away everything and that's it, but he didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So these boys left. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">My mother went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Uh they went out...they had a point in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where to meet and my mother went back, of course, and the next day they rounded them all up, shot them to _—_— exploded . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Uh my brothers left and went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and went to terrorize some peasants, got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans, with what, how I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Uh a little bit later some escaped Soviet prisoners of war joined them and a lot of...all the people came. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And some of them uh craftsmen, you know, uh blacksmiths, uh uh they built, built <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="596">Some had a small trade see, and they they were needed, you know, because they built uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> and the the uh they called it, uh they dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and lined it with wood and slept in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And they accumulated some <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> of food and they were ready to do some damage to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The uh this <span class="REGION">territory</span> where we lived had some unexploded artillery shells from the 1st World War yet, and the young kids, twelve, fourteen years old...some of them survived ...used to take out the explosives from there, put in a detonator and make a <span class="DLF">mine</span> to put under the <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> where the Germans shipped, you know, war supplies and and troops to the front, but it was way back already behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> , so they used to uh...they got in touch with Soviet, you know, Soviet army. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They dropped by parachute more arms and they were uh really an effective fighting force. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Uh my old...my younger brother...I was the oldest...one day they they had their own uh spy network among the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">They found out they're going to be attacked by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Uh sure enough within a short time they were attacked, but before before...but they really were attacked they decided to move the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They had to forge a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and uh but they had some stores of food and didn't want to abandon it, so they left some guards to guard it and among them was my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh so when they came with this force attacked...the force consisted of Germans, lots of troops...Russian, the Ukrainian police, my brother was standing guard and when he saw it was too late already . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">To do anything he shot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and the others that were were supposed to replace him...there were about five sets of them boys...one of them was my cousin...my brother was away already at the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the other brother... . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Some were wounded but the majority survived the attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They moved further and got stronger, stronger, stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">German troop movements . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That's a story though that not many people know about but this Ukrainian uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ukrainian police forest</span> , very thick <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamps</span> . </span><span class="sentence"
