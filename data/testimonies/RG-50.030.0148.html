was...when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , I was given working papers, so-called working papers, permission to work as a non-Hungarian citizen in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for...I got permission for 4 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">In other words, I should have been in good order up until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But as soon as...after the first High Holy Days. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">That means before 1937 already, the French policei. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">The ones who controlled the people who...who are not citizen butt in and they made sure that we will be asked to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> or arrest us. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So that danger was tremendously big and that was the time when I think in 1938 or the beginning of 39, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to try out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I was elected. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">However, I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I performed services, the President of that congregation, I should have been elected to be the cantor of the <span class="BUILDING">Dukes Place Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But this wasn't to be because the night after we...we had a meeting with the Board, I got a telegram from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> sent to me by Secretary General saying your case is in good order again. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We expect you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> lovingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So, being that my family was already settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and so on, I didn't ask for expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I didn't ask anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I ran like crazy and went back and...uh...went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It seems It's all fate because I could have...I could have just signed the agreement and stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but no, it wasn't to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Now, during these terrible years, 38, I was...the first time I was called into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was in 38 or the beginning in 39 because the big trouble really continued, which started as a said before that the doctors couldn't be doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The lawyers could be lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">The professionals couldn't be professionals anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It expanded to the point where me, at the time, yet younger Jews were called into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I was called in and...uh...I served for the first time in...not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shirastopeck</span> , meaning nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We built <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I'm asking you for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I don't think an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> ever... ever appeared there. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Just to...to make it hard on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And this went on almost to the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The first two years I would say 38, 39 and maybe the beginning of 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I was still within the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I was called in many, many times, but not over...not sent over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Later on...uh...toward the end of the...of the war, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galicea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We were in former <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dunn River</span> we went, and that's the way they ___ us and gave us difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They finally...
QUESTION:  We don't..We want to go to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  The thing I would like to do is (coughing) is to pause here and change tapes and then we go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I want to know more about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">We're on. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The camera is back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Uh...Cantor Mandel, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> around 1941 with all of this happening, what was it like for you, for your family, inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was still employed by the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I got my monthly check and we could make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">However, my mother remained at the time still in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">My father has died already, so I brought her up to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and she lived for a very short while in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the <span class="BUILDING">Rabbinical Seminary</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish <span class="BUILDING">college</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They had to get a degree from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So in order to save him from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> when he came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...seminary. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It was no problem because he had a tremendous amount of Hebrew knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we wanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">For instance, we...we needed some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was the superintendent of our <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> , they sent up...I don't know...geese and whatever we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> at any time during the day and buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They had a certain hour or two...I don't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And of course when they...when they could go out everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was a very, very hard life with a lot of things missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yugo</span> ...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yugo</span> ...again that was formerly <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They helped us out with many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Now, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the big congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">However, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it was handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And so...
QUESTION:  What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this 1s against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I did one more thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a district in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">7th district</span> , which didn't exist before. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">One family had old people; the other had the young people and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But they were moved together in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , and other <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were taken away because there were some <span class="REGION">districts</span> where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> ; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about... Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so that the Jews would be together already. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And this was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Now what is your next question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  What happened to you as the years progressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  As the years progressed, 1940... Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for 4 weeks and then called back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and was there for 2 months let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I had the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or Shuef. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for...for the time I was allowed to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Summer months we almost constantly were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...g0 <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> , came for a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny, was a very small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all her heart, she told my wife, her sister, "Look, the child has a cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He's coughing and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="481"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> is still about a 100 kilometer south. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I will take him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Maybe his cough with subside easier there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there were two chief cantors in___ <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> that my colleague who was with me will take over all my duties for Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">There were many, many weddings and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He will take over, and I will take over for him the next time when it's his next. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> on Thursday and stayed with this sister-in-law in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and Friday morning before...at dawn, my father-in-law, who lived close by, came over to his daughter, to us, to tell her, tell us, inform us that there is a pogrom outside and the Jews and ____ are picked up and congregated somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So it was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That was a Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We...we waited in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">About II:00 the gendarme with full glairy, fixed up with his machine gun and all that came to take us to a certain <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where the Jews were con...were gathered, and from there they were marched down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We didn't know that this will happen, but this 1s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The Jew...the ____ and the Jews were down...were taken down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> was frozen maybe...I don't know how many inches thick, but they...they threw some...uh...material, some military bomb or something into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , probed the....uh...the thing open...ice, the ice open and took the people into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they had to undress and naked to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trampoline</span> which was over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> , and they were shot into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They were shot and fell into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Now, this went on for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arriving there with ___ and Jewish people and they were all put into a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I think a <span class="DLF">line</span> of two and there was always a gendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people who are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The really...the newly occu...back occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> because you know that was <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , then <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , then the Hungarians occupied it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So when our next came, before us was standing the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...uh... where my sister- in-law lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">When our next came, the policeman came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I was holding Manny in my coat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and said...uh...""What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You are not a Czechnik?" </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Czechnik meant the...the people who hated <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">The serp people and others who hated <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">You are no Czechnik. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And he was all terribly excited, and ran over to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, "The...the Chief Cantor from the ____ is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He's...he's not a cheknik. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He's... know him, and I 'm there many times." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Namely, as I told you before, the _____ Temple was a very narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So he knew me very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Stand him...let him stand aside.” </span><span class="sentence" id="516">This saved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So 1f anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't believe it, but it's true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Can you go back to that scene with these people at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Tell me what it was like, what you saw, and what you were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What was the scene like at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  The scene was...the scene was 29 degrees celsius. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">People were crying, and when we heard tut, tut, tut, tut, another few shots, we...we knew what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We imagined what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And people were crying and hollering and...and throwing themselves to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and as...as...as...as can well be imagined what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But before we should have gone in and be the next ones to be killed, the killing stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">From there, we were taken into a...into a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ...uh...walked back and...uh...when we spoke about where we are going and...and what happened, the...uh....one of the policeman was walking along side with us told me, "You are very lucky people. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I don't know if you know what's happened <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">It was a bathing stop at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> all the time, and then it became the killing spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So he said, "You are very lucky people. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">You don't know....do you know what happened <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And...uh...he told us the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was Friday afternoon when we arrived to this <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> where we were held...uh...for a couple of hours and told that now we are clear...we are in the clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Everything is fine because it was proved that we are not chekniks. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and, of course, as you...we didn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Saturday evening we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , it was...this kind of thing at the time did not happen yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">41. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It happened many times after that in 42 and 43 when groups of 50 and...and maybe hundred were gathered and were taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> by 10 or 12 and shot into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">This happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Later on, this became a daily occurrence in 43 and...uh...and 44.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Now, my family became part of...of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> , the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the time... was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, "Though ____ (that's my Hungarian name) isn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son, Emmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So he was extremely active. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He probably had something to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people.</span></p>
