<p><span class="sentence" id="2385">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2386">ANSWER:  And the reason why I did, and especially [indecipherable] they had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and Philip Bernstein wrote a book which 1s called, “What do Jews Believe?” </span><span class="sentence" id="2387">It wa -- it was a long time ago, but it was a bestseller. </span><span class="sentence" id="2388">And his sermons were just out of this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2389">So I went out of my own will, I went every Friday in my last year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , cause he was inspiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2390">QUESTION:  Well, that’s interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2391">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2392">QUESTION:  And when you got married, did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2393">Or did you send your kids to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2394">ANSWER:  We always landed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that was far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , because we moved around a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2395">And even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> east, the Jews lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> south, but we couldn’t afford the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2396">So the children were really not exposed much, except that we sent Jack and Mark to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mansfield</span> at the time, which was about 12 miles away from us, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mansfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2397">And Jack was ready to be Bar-Mitzvahed, but he didn’t want to be Bar-Mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2398">And when Mark was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , he became almost a born again Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2399">He happened to have a friend who was, and his friend’s mother and I met through unusual circumstances and became close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2400">But she got Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="2401">She got them to go with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to the Peace March and all the things that they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2402">And my husband said, I don’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2403">And then my husband read in the Jewish news that there was going to be some kind of Jewish meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , but you didn’t know how Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2404">So he went there, and he met Rabbi Hecht. </span><span class="sentence" id="2405">Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Orthodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out to the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="2406">And he got Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="2407">And now Mark is Orthodox.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2408">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2409">ANSWER:  And it’s really unusual because we -- we didn’t have mu-much contact with Jewish people when we -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2410">But then, when we had to move to those small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> , there were hardly any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2411">And it was a hardship to take him every Sunday to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , especially if one of them didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2412">So Roseanne was not very much -- we couldn’t show her very mu -- didn’t show her very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="2413">But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be Jewish, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2414">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2415">ANSWER:  So that’s how it worked with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="2416">I think Jack identifies with us as being Jewish, but he wanted to show his daughter what the high holidays were like, and he brought her to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> , and they told him you can’t come in unless you pay 500 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="2417">That was --
QUESTION:  And that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="2418">Have you ever talked about your experiences to schoolchildren, have you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2419">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2420">But the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> got to know about me through Mark, who was a -- a member there, active member. </span><span class="sentence" id="2421">A-An -- and -- and -- and about my -- he talked about my background, and they have a Yom HaShoah -- they have a few days ago in the <span class="BUILDING">Conservative synagogue</span> , the Reform, and there’s little one, ultra-Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="2422">And some [indecipherable] 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they have some kind of ceremony where we have to -- the -- the survivors have to go up on the <span class="DLF">stage</span> , and they have to turn on a candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2423">And they don’t say who they are -- we are, but we are the survivors, and so I was called by the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center</span> to take part.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2436">QUESTION:  When -- when you think about your life now, and you think about what it was like for you in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> because of the war, and because you were in hiding, do you think that changed you very much?</span></p>
