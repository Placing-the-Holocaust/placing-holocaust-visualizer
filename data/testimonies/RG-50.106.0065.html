<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My parents came -- My biological parents came from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , which I understand is now <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And then my father remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My other mother came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Both came over about — all three of them came over about the same time, 1914, 1913, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Do you have any?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Let's talk right now a little bit about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">When you said "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> ," whereabouts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  And what kind of schooling did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  I went through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and that's as far as I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Abraham Lincoln High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and James Monroe High School in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Those were the two <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> I went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My parents kept moving around because my father was a grocer, kept selling one <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , moving to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">borough</span> , and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  How would you describe your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Was it a very close family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Not close, but a loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My father -- my mother passed away when I was five years old and my father remarried two years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So there were two years that I was sort of kicked around from relative to relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And some of them didn't want me because I wasn't a very nice child, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, I was a little wild, a little cantankerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">As a matter of fact, my mother always used to say, "Don't worry, you'll have children." </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I had a son who was just as wild as I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  How religious was your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  My mother -- my second mother was a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the truth is, I got so much of religion that as soon as I graduated -- rather, had my bar mitzvah -- I quit the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That was the end of my Jewish education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Did you have any other feelings about being Jewish at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  I didn't like being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Only because I had so much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> where the old people used to look at young kids as Americana failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don't know if you understand Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Wild animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Because we want through the <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I just couldn't wait to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So my Hebrew education was very, very nil until I got into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">There, I found out that it was pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We discussed history with the chaplains and I began to find my religion -- not that I was ever religious, but I began to find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  When you say you went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , was that an after-school Hebrew school and you went to regular <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  After-school Hebrew school.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What languages did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  My parents spoke Yiddish, and of course I never knew I could talk Yiddish until I got into the service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And that's where I began to speak half German, half Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">That consists of my Yiddish today. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Did you have friends that were not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> most of the time, but I did have some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Not really, because living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , I thought the whole world was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Allright. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Well, let's move on now. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Did you have any other interests, any hobbies, any sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was on track, baseball, the usual things. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Nothing outstanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was never a real good athlete, so to speak, but I enjoyed athletics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Were you close to your siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My brother, who's six years older than I, lived his own life. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He was always single. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He just got married maybe 15 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was always with the social bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we were never a close family. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was only after I got married that I began to have a family and a close family, my wife's family, my own family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Now, you've graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  And what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I went to work carrying the bags of a jewelry salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And it was quite an experience, and I did that for about a year or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then I went to work for a <span class="BUILDING">jewelry company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And for the beginning of my life before the service, that's about all I did, working for <span class="BUILDING">jewelry companies</span> , because that's where my experience lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then I went into the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  We're talking now probably around 1937, I guess, when you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  What was your knowledge of Hitler at that point, or what was your knowledge of what was happening in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Very little or nothing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I only realized -- that's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I only realized what could be going on in Europe when I was in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I remember sitting in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper that they found out — I think it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that they realized that Jews were being tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And they began to explain to us as to how the torture was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I put the paper away and I went about my business. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It never had any effect on me whatever, at all, until of course I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then I became Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  So you were not aware of restrictions in Europe on the Jews in the mid '30s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I mean, I can't say I was completely ignorant of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I knew that the Jews were having trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">As a matter of fact, we had relatives in Europe, my father did. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I'm close to them today, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And my father was trying to help them come over and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But I don't know the details because I really didn't care at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I was worried about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I was worried about my well-being, so to speak, and finding a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Those days, it was important to find a job and support yourself and move out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which is what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  How old were you when you moved out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Just before -- not long before I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I got married at 24. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I must have moved out at 21, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So now you had been working. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And you said you moved out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Then the draft came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I just want to get my facts straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The draft came along, and I figured that's the greatest way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That's the best thing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I didn't join because I was Jewish or because I looked to save the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I joined to change my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And this is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I was rejected six times because I had a hernia. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And each time I'd go down there in the hopes that they would let me get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Finally they wouldn't let me get in, so I went for an operation, a hernia operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It cost me $250, which I saved up. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And was it the sixth time I went down there? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was rejected because of my eyesight. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I was put on limited service. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But the seventh time I got in. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And as a matter of fact, I remember that first night in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I had already met my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I was going with her and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My first night in the service, they put me in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with maybe 100 other guys, and I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">top bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And there I was, lying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I'm looking at the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , which was like a foot or two away. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I'm saying, "What am I doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Who needs this? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I volunteered for this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And that was my introduction into the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  What month and what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I got out in'45. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Two and a half years I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I'm trying to think of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  What time of year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  I guess spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Yeah, it must have been spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Early spring or summer, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">If I had my discharge in front of me, I could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But I don't really remember the date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  And did you have any specific feelings about Hitler or what was happening at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I just heard about it but very vaguely from -- I read newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I'm an avid reader in that context. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And it didn't affect me one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  So where did you first go when you were drafted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Upton</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> or <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , I forget where. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we stayed there -- I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> for less than six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">From there, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plattsburgh</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then we came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elkins</span> , <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then we went right to the port of embarkation 1n a period of about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I went overseas to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Conington</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Spent a nice time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Never worrying about what the war was going to be like or anything like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Let's back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Why did you try to keep volunteering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Iwasa patriotic American. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That's the only reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Not because -- I had heard things, but it didn't affect me that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I felt that 1t was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I had heard about Hitler; I can't say that I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But it didn't affect me that much only because I didn't pay too much attention to any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I was in there because I wanted to change my life, for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And for another thing, I wanted to get into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I wanted something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I wanted some adventure, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being Yiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I could possibly be. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I got along with most everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I never suffered any real discrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they took Fridays off and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And they were discriminated against, not me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Had you talked in detail with your parents about what was happening -- this is before you were drafted -- about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">This is solely my own doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The only one I talked to really about it was my girlfriend, who is my wife now. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And my parents just wouldn't -- didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They were European people. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My mother, who is my second mother, was just as good to me as my original mother, who I barely remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we had no rapport with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I couldn't talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My father was busy in the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">My second mother was there helping him. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I never saw my father, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He'd go into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> before I got up, come back from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> after I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">As a matter of fact, I remember one time I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I looked into their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> as I passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was a railroad flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And I looked into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and there was my father in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I had never seen my father in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And I looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I says, "Hi, Pop. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">How are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He says, "Not so good." </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I says, "What's the matter?" </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And it was like almost the first time I ever sat down with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I says, "What's the matter?" </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He says, "I hurt my back and I can't move." </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then I said to him, "Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I says, "I've never seen you that way before." </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He says, "Herbert," he says, "I can't afford to be sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What I'm trying to bring out 1s, that was my upbringing, the work ethic and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But close to my parents, I never was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Let's jump ahead a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You were drafted and you're now in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> England</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Conington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We spent about three months there. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Very, very pleasant experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And then we moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , which was a staging area for the invasion of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  What unit were you in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  628th Light Equipment Engineers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about 100 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And we worked the shovels and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">road graders</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> , and so on, clearing <span class="DLF">roads</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We were doing that in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And we were moved from the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then we were transferred as we went down to the Third Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And then in Europe, I think we wound up with the Seventh Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I'm not quite sure of these details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  And now you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , waiting for the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> I guess it must have been about a month until the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And we went over about D-plus 10, 12, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">D-Day plus 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I wasn't part of the initial invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But it was a little harrowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And we got stuck on a <span class="DLF">sand bar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And finally they got us off and they were bombing us and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">From there, we landed on <span class="DLF">Utah Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I didn't even remember the <span class="DLF">beach</span> until I sort of looked it up for my company. </span><span class="sentence" id="243"><span class="DLF">Utah Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And then from there, we sort of went inland through the <span class="DLF">hedgerows</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  At this point, did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews or did you know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were under fire here and there, bombardments and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I didn't have time to worry about anybody else but myself, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  What was it like for you to see dead bodies at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Oh, that's when we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And somebody said to us, "Hey, fellows, you better get up to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There are a lot of dead bodies up there." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A civilian told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And those are the pictures that I show you of what we actually saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They never even had a chance to pick up the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The bodies didn't even smell yet because they were so new. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The Germans had left voluntarily because they were afraid of who was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And we got there about an hour after they had shot a lot of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> -- I saw them myself -- with bodies piled in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> seemed to be too small for the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But then there was a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> with a bunch of bodies in that they had spread lime on. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then it began to dawn on me what I was looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And then I became a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  We'll talk about Ohrdruf in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Let's go back a little bit to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Anything else -- any other combat experiences or any fighting that you went through in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Well, we were bombarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And during the Bulge, the Germans were really shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engineer outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And we had to move back into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> until the invasion was over, the German invasion was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And then as they cleared it up, we began to move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And when we first got into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it was -- really, there were snipers firing at us and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But I was never in any real hand- to-hand or person-to-person combat per se.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  Did you see any dead bodies at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Oh, all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> we always saw dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I'm talking about dead bodies of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And all the way through, we had seen dead bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  How did you feel about seeing a dead body?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  At first, I was appalled. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And after that, strangely enough, you get used to seeing bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You don't pay any attention to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And if there's an odor, you walk over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but you leave the bodies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were just -- it's a matter of survival, really, being in the service under those conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And you're worried about yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">That is, until I got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Was your unit made up of other Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Wehad some. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had a few Jews there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Did you stick together with them or did you mix with everybody else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Notreally. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I had two basic friends who were Jewish -- three. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">One was the lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The other was -- the other two were buddies of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And we sort of -- the three of us stuck out together. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">The lieutenant, he was sort of in another category. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we went <span class="NPIP">places</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We did things together and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk among yourselves about what was happening to Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And that surprises me. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I'm so dedicated now to that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I wasn't before. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I really wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And it's been since the site of the holocaust, since being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , that I really became Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">As a matter of fact, my son didn't want to be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become bar mitzvahed and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">These two girls that I brought with me are fairly religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now you've crossed over the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Well, I think the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I remember was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And then we moved past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and we were told about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> which I just told you about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Who told you about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  A German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  A German person or a German townsperson?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">See, I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I was amazed to find out that I could talk German. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">As a matter of fact, I became the interpreter between the Germans and my outfit because the boy, "Hey, Bitter, he talks German." </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I was really talking Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That's where we found out, and that's where we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There were a few of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I don't remember who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I know that my two buddies were among them but I don't remember who else. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And then we saw the bodies --
QUESTION:  Wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Let's back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">This German townsperson tells you that there is acamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And so what was the next thing that you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Did you report this to your superior? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We just -- a bunch of us went to where we -- he said there was a lot of dead bodies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We didn't know whether they were Germans or Jewish or Americans or anything, so we went there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  How could you leave your unit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Well, we were all spread out. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We were in various <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And remember, I was in an outfit with 100 men and we were attached to various divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So it was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They just told us where it was, and we drove up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  What was your rank at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Corporal. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And we drove up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And there was --
QUESTION:  "We" being who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  The two buddies that I had, Jewish boys, Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Why did you want to go there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Only to see what was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We were told there were bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we had to find out what they were, whether they were Americans, whether they were Germans, whether they were -- we didn't know anything about, really, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We did not expect a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> per se.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  What was the name or what were you told that the name of this <span class="NPIP">location</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  He just told us where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He didn't give us any name or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  How did he describe the <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  He says, "There's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with bodies 3 miles away up this <span class="DLF">road</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He says, "Why don't you go up there and look at it." </span><span class="sentence" id="360">See, the Germans were terribly afraid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They didn't want to be tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They thought that maybe we would come in and torture them. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And of course, we weren't looking to cause any havoc. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So we wanted to see what the bodies were that were up 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  What date was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  I don't remember the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was right after we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , after the -- better still, it was the day before Eisenhower, Bradley, and --
QUESTION:  Patton?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  -- Patton were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Of course, they came later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  So this must have been April 11th because they came on April 12th, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Did you know the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> before you went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  I found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And that's one of the things that bugged me because we didn't know where we were, just that we were past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and that there was this camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And the pictures will show you exactly what we saw as we went through the <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">There was no resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You are three young soldiers in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  And you are driving up this <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">What's the first sight that you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  We saw this <span class="DLF">fence</span> , which was a <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And as we drove in, we saw bodies lying all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We didn't even know they were Jewish or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We just saw the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And then we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And there were a number of people who were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">A number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And they began to yell in Yiddish to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I understood Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I began to talk to them and they began to tell us what went on, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And this was all new to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We had never experienced anything like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And there was one Polish boy in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And surprisingly enough, he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he held onto that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And he was the one that showed us around from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , showed us where they slept, showed us where the bodies were. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And we were just absolutely appalled. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That was a real revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  You had a camera with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I always carried a camera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  And you so you took pictures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It was after an hour or two of being there that we took the pictures because this Polish boy wanted food or whatever he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And he took us around to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And we wanted to see what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I had my camera with me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And he took us into a -- these long <span class="INT_SPACE">cottages</span> where they slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Unlike what I've seen in the movies, these were like <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> for cattle, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And there was a wooden bar in between the <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And they were packed with hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And that's where they slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They slept one right next to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You could barely move in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And we went up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And then we saw the bodies in the — outside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I didn't see a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I didn't know whether they were gassed or -- we didn't think of asking these questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And then he took us to this <span class="DLF">pit</span> where there must have been 500 bodies, something like that, covered with lime. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And what they were going to do with these bodies is throw them into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> because they couldn't burn all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">They were going to throw these bodies into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> , but they didn't have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">There was no time because the Americans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And they didn't know who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">All the Germans knew was that the Americans are coming, let's get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And there wasn't a German in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as we walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But we see the Jews firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  What was your feeling when you first heard Yiddish words from these prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  I'm just trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to various -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the Yiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with us, we used him asa KP. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And he said to me one day -- we gave him a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when we came into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And he said to me, "Do you do you speak Yiddish? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Komm zu mine Zimmer." </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He said, "Come to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="437">He wanted to show me something because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I says, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I says, "But was is dat Zimmer?" </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I had never heard of the word "Zimmer." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He says "It's Zimmer," and he showed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And he took me up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that he was staying in. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I says, "You mean a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic expressions that pick up the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I never knew that a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a Zimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so that's the kind of Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  How did you feel when they spoke Yiddish and you realized that these prisoners were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  It didn't quite hit me immediately or anything like that, but I began to feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it was only when I met these girls that I began to realize what had -- the bodies, of course, you can't misinterpret. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But I began to understand what was going on in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  What was the condition of the bodies? </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Had they looked like they had endured starvation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  We didn't look that closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They were dead, and they weren't dead very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We assumed that they had been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They may have been shot just before we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But they couldn't get rid of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And that was not a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But there wasn't enough time to get rid of all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  When did you know the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I think it may have been while I was there somebody may have mentioned it or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I'm not quite sure where I learned the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But I never heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find out whether there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  And the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Ohrdruf. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  So you learned the name of it, you said, when you were there, that 1t was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You have seen these bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Any other impressions that you can talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Well, we were there just a good part of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now, it wasn't our job to remove the bodies or do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We had to contact I think it was the civil government of the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They would come in and take care of the government and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  But you said that there were a lot of other American soldiers already there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  From my company. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We were the first company to walk in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There must have been -- in my company, there must have been 25, 40 guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And of course, the word spread after that that there was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And that's where Eisenhower must have found out about it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But they came the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  How do you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Isaw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">In other words, we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We didn't stay far from them because we were bivouacking, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And we didn't know they were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And all of a sudden the <span class="DLF">gates</span> open up and an entourage comes in, maybe 100 or 200 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And of course the bodies had remained there overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There was nothing we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And they came in and they were looking around and the cameras and all that sort of jazz. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And they went through the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And somebody was explaining to them what had happened and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">In other words, the hierarchy of the military had come in, and they learned about what happened and they were showing it to the general. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I believe that was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> maybe the only one, that the three generals were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  So you actually saw General Eisenhower?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  General Eisenhower, General Bradley. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I'm not quite sure about Patton. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He was there, but I didn't quite see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He was sort of walking on his own, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But Eisenhower and Bradley were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Wherever they went, they were together with a bunch of colonels and military muck-mucks or whatever they call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And they were explaining to the general what had happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They had heard it from one of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was, what it was, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  I'm sure you're aware of the famous quote from General Eisenhower that he wrote to Churchill -- and I'd just like to maybe read it a little bit and see what your reaction 1s to it- that he sent in a letter to Churchill after he had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="514">The things I saw beggar description. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology were overpowering. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I made the visit deliberately in order to be ina position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda." </span><span class="sentence" id="517">When he said he saw evidence of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology --
ANSWER:  I don't know about beastiology, but I know cruelty, starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">That's something I had never mentioned, the fact that they were emaciated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">These people were skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And we tried to help them, but we didn't have food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We had some K- rations and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We did the best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And that's why we decided to come back the next day, to see if we could be of any -- we didn't know that the generals were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And we brought back some food and so on and so forth, but it didn't amount to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And we were just appalled by what we had seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And really, I can't honestly say that it sunk in at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would have felt the same way more or less at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We were interested in seeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We couldn't believe that something like this existed, that people could be so cruel as to shoot them, starve them, hang them, which is in those pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We just couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And if anybody tells you he realized what it was -- maybe Eisenhower did, but we didn't until it began to sink in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  What did you say and what did the Jewish prisoners say to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">What kind of thoughts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  They were all anxious to tell me their stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Strangely enough, Jewish people love to relate their problems and what had happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And those that could -- a lot of them were too weak to even talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">You know, they told us about where they came from, what had happened to them, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But there were so many stories that one story ran into another. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">There were so many terrible stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And they're all most willing to talk And as a matter of fact, what I really found out more than anything else were the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I don't want to get too far ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I really found out what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They were explicit and they were able to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But as far as I was concerned, we heard so many stories at the same time, all terrible stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And it's like somebody pricking your finger here, here, here, here, and you couldn't know where it hurts only because there are so many different <span class="NPIP">spots</span> that it hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And we had heard so many terrible stories that there were too many to affect us, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I don't know if you can understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But after a while, we began to understand what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Did your other -- the other soldiers that you were with speak Yiddish, the two others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I was the only one that spoke Yiddish, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And therefore, I was able to relate to some of these people better than some of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Of course, a lot of them just didn't understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Did you touch any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I held their hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I sat with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We were there for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And then strangely enough, here are people who are dying, who -- we picked ourselves up and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It's a terrible thing not to realize the degradation that went on and the cruelty that went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">After all, we were in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And yet we were able to pick ourselves up and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I don't know if I could do that today, leave back to the <span class="REGION">bivouac area</span> knowing that we were going to come back the next day with whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And it wasn't very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But then the military government moved in right after we left, and I guess they took care of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  How did you know that you were the first Americans to come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  There was nobody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There was absolutely nobody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We walked in through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , opened up the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They weren't locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Rather, the <span class="DLF">gates</span> -- the <span class="DLF">barbed wire gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We opened them and walked right in. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We could see the scenes of the dead from outside the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And we just went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And there was absolutely nobody there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  Were you frightened when you first saw the piles of dead bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">We had seen dead bodies all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And we came in and we were just curious to know what it was that we were looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We really didn't know what we were seeing, at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And then we realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I may be contradicting myself but the thoughts are coming so quick and so fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  This is Tape 1, Side B, of the interview of Herbert Bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Before we continue, I'd like to clarify some facts that we talked about on the previous <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You had said that you had come over the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  That's correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , I just don't remember where we went because I was completely unfamiliar with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf camp</span> , and you said you were staying in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and that a man told you there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> 3 miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Do you remember the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  It might have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I'm not quite sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">You mean --
ANSWER:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="597"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Ohrdruf. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf camp</span> and when you saw Eisenhower. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Because it is understood that Eisenhower was there on April 12th, which was the date that President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Do you have anything to say about that, about when you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  Icertainly do. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I believe if I got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the following day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">That was the very next day because the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And they came and they looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I don't remember who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Now, the next thing I know 1s that I saw pictures of the fact that Eisenhower was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">There seemed to be a lot of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And the day that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were supposed to have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Now, I had seen the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that Eisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And then they may have come back with photographers and with whoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Before we leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> , I just wanted to ask you again some of your impressions and other <span class="NPIP">sites</span> that you saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Did you have a sense of the layout of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  More or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">As we came in, we saw the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">To the right of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> -- I'm trying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping areas</span> were laid out like in <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> , like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that separated each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And that's all they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And they were filled with straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And then we went from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We saw an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And as we went further, we saw this long <span class="DLF">pit</span> where there must have been hundreds of bodies covered with lime. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> so they could bury them and bodies above that and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">How did you handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when you saw piles of bodies and ovens and <span class="DLF">lime pits</span> and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">This was a terrible, terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And then of course we realized that they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We felt a little bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But you must understand that it doesn't hit you suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You're looking and you say "That's a terrible thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then you go on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It's only after visiting there, after being away from there that I began to realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me what they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">This is a holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these sites?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Because remember when you're in the service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And I felt badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I can't say that it just passed over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We started to talk about it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they can't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It's too much to take in at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Always. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews, and I spoke to some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">He served as a KP for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He may not have known about all of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He was just a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and that's why I was able to communicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  How old was he and where did you find him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  He must have been about 35 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We found him walking along the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And he asked if he could be part of our outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He wanted to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And we said, "Well, we're not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We're going in the opposite direction." </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He says, "Can I go with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He says, "I have to eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So we gave him an American uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We set him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Nobody knew who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I communicated with him on a regular basis only because of the Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  And whereabouts did you find him? </span><span class="sentence" id="673">What <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It may have been in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It's just that he was with us for quite a length of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And actually, when we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> to go over to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't go aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So we had some of the boys put him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , took him down to the <span class="DLF">shipyards</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They put him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was going to eventually wind up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I never heard from him after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  Do you remember his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  Meischer (phonetic). </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That's as much as I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Had you heard of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Asa matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , and they told me it was a satellite of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  Of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  How many days were you at -- in the <span class="REGION">Ohrdruf area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Several days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  And how many times did you go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  We went back the next day and possibly once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And then we had to move on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Did you say that you had brought food back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It was a drop in the bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us because they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I didn't do the notifying myself, but somebody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And I guess they eventually came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  So just to clarify, you're saying that you were one of the first to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because there were no other soldiers around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  I think we were the first because there was nobody in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> -- the <span class="DLF">barbed wire gates</span> and we walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And this is what we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Were there any dead SS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Only civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Only people who were either shot or died in some way, and then the few that were just wandering around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">They were sort of lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They were in a fog.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  Did you feel any differently after this experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> than before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  I felt a kinship and a compassion. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Well, let's move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So you then were ordered to leave that general <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  And where did you then move? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Did you go eastward?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  Well, we went toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> because I remember being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And the war was beginning to wind down. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was -- we came across a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And really, I didn't come across the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">One of the officers came to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and said, "Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I said, "Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="727">He says, "Boy, you're going to have a good time." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I says, "What do you mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He says, "I found a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> full of Jewish broads," and that's exactly the way he put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And he says, "They can't talk to anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="731">He said, "I can't talk to them." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">He says, "Let me drive you there and I'll pick you up." </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I say, "Can I be there that long?" </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He says, "I'll pick you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I'll come and I'll wait for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="736">He says, "But Have a good time." </span><span class="sentence" id="737">He was being very facetious. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of the four girls standing outside this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And I went up to the, girls knowing that they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, "What are you doing, girls?" </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They had never seen an American-Jewish soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They had not seen anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They knew they were liberated because the Germans had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And they grabbed me, literally grabbed me, pulled me into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I heard screaming and yelling of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And there were girls coming from all over the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200 girls, all disciplined. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">All sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">There was one girl who took charge, and she explained to them who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And we spoke in sort of Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And then she said, "I want you to" -- in Yiddish she said, "I want you to hear the stories of some of these girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I want you to know what we went through." </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I says, "All right." </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And I sat there for the next two or three hours just listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And each girl, she said, "Yanni (phonetic), get up and tell your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Myrtle, get up and tell your story." </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And one by one, there must have been 20 girls, that had -- and they told how they had been raped and taken advantage of and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And I began to feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I wanted to kill somebody after listening to these girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And finally they finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They said, "Do you want to hear more?" </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I says, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">That's enough." </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And of course, I had to get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And the officer was waiting forme. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So I says, "Maidloch (phonetic), I'll be back tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I says, "What can I bring you," I says, "in the way of food?" </span><span class="sentence" id="770">She says, "Food, we're all right on." </span><span class="sentence" id="771">She says, "But can you bring us a few sidurim," prayer books. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And I says, "Well, we don't have many, but I'll pick up every one I can find." </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I went back and I got about three or four from the boys in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I went back the next day with some food, whatever it was, and the girls just couldn't get over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I was the first liberator that they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I spent a good part of the day with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I took my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we spent some time, and then I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And of course, I took a picture with the girls or all the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Here is the Jewish girls liberated from the <span class="BUILDING">German factory</span> , slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And it was interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  Now, can you tell me again where this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  It was after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And I cannot remember the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I can't remember the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or what they did in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was full of girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Only girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  How much later after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> did you come across this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  Several days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  And were you heading eastward or westward?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  We were heading eastward. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weida</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was in the <span class="REGION">Russian section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And we spent quite a bit of time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And then of course we doubled back to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  And you don't know what kind of <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  No, I have no idea what they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They were so busy telling me about their experiences, not what they were, not -- but they wanted people to know how they suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And believe me, they let me know how they suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And it was then that the whole thing was coming together, that I began to realize what was going on in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">It's not one incident that sets you apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It's all of these incidents together. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And you begin to realize there's a pattern there. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And that's what I began to realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">As a matter of fact, I myself -- I don't know if I told you, I was sitting in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And they had liberated some camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I think it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And I read the article in Stars and Stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And I read about how these people suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I closed the Stars and Stripes, put them away, and I went about my business like it didn't affect me in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">It does affect me now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in that area of the <span class="BUILDING">labor factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  Two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I was there the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I had to go and get on with the outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So I was there the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And then the second day I came back by myself with the sidurim. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And I spent a good part of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And then I went back to my outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">QUESTION:  Did you talk about this with the -- Was there a chaplain that you could talk things over with? </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And if so, did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">ANSWER:  No, because we had to move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There was nobody I could really talk to because we were an individual outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We were -- we had to be attached to various armies to do the work for them and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So there was nobody I could talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And I knew that behind us was a civil and military governments who were cleaning up and taking care of whatever we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And of course, the Germans didn't know any of this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">None of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And they were very, very happy to see the Americans because they didn't want to see the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So they were very, very happy to see us and welcome us. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And they had white flags outside of all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And it was a very, very nice thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Why do you say that your experience at the women's slave labor factory made an

"</span><span class="sentence" id="838">This is what happened to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And then another one said, "This is what happened to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And when you hear so many individual stories, not a group of people talking with one story, there are a group of people talking with many, many stories, that has to affect you even if you're not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And it affected me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Were these women wearing yellow stars?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  Ihave to look at the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">No, they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Evidently the war or the Germans were in such retreat that they weren't afraid any more because the Germans had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">They were frightened, they didn't know what was going to happen to them, and they began to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And basically, they weren't wearing stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  And then you left this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And then where did your unit go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">ANSWER:  And then we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , as I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And we wound up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weida</span> , W-E-I-D-A: And we were bivouacked in a <span class="BUILDING">schoolhouse</span> , and we spent the balance of the war there. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Because we had to go from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , we were going to be put aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> for the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I had enough points to get out and I was very mad and we were very irritated and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But while we were there -- we got aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and we're all -- pardon me -- bitching. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And this was after Roosevelt had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And Truman took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And while we were aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , Truman declared all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that are headed for <span class="DLF">foreign ports</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military ships</span> , to turn back and go to the nearest <span class="DLF">American port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And I was one of the first troops to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>

QUESTION:  When you got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , did you talk about Ohrdruf with family? </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Did you talk about the <span class="BUILDING">labor factory</span> stories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  No, we didn't talk about much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">It came out over a period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I may have mentioned it but never any details. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I didn't want to talk about my time in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I had so many other things that I wanted to do that I wasn't going to start -- actually a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I was already married. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I was married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plattsburgh</span> while I was in the service, which I didn't mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And I was busy looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live because in those days you couldn't find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And it was only gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I never spoke about that to my parents, for some reason or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I sort of felt they wouldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I may have mentioned one or two things, but I had spoken to my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">She would be the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">My children were the ones that were affected by this more than anybody else through me. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And every time they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they spoke about the holocaust, they insisted on taking the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">That's why I have so few pictures left. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And they were more affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">That's why my daughter called you because she had heard these stories over the years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION:  Did you show these photographs that you had? </span><span class="sentence" id="884">When you first got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , did you show them to anybody”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The only people that saw them was when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , they asked me -- when we found out that it was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and so forth, they asked me whether I had pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And they said, "Would you send me pictures?" </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I made copies. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Somebody had a machine that made copies, and I sent them the copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  Did you show your wife these pictures? </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I'm talking about in the 1940s. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I'm not talking about later. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I'm saying when you first came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Did you show your wife the photographs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  She had seen them, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">It's just that I don't know the period of time that had elapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I wasn't hesitant to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I just didn't want to go into any detail, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So my wife saw all the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And she speaks Yiddish pretty well so she understood basically what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And I didn't talk about any gory details because I wasn't interested in my family reliving it with me or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Because I had lived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">They had seen the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">They knew what I went through over a period of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We had always been talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And I didn't sit them down and tell them -- first of all, they were too young, but it was over a period of years that we talked about it, we discussed it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So they know everything that I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">It's just that we didn't do it in one session or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION:  Did what you go through affect -- you had alluded to this before -- affect your feelings about being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  I became more Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  Because I began to realize what these people had gone through, and I began to see with my own eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I told you, over a period of time it just sort of built up in me until I really began -- any chance I had to help holocaust victims or whatever it is, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And we're very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">We have our own chavurah, which is a group of friends that get together that are all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And my wife is very active in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadassah</span> , in all the Jewish organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And it's a difficult <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be Jewish, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , a difficult thing to be Jewish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , especially when we first moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So she's very active there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  Can you just summarize what happened after the war, professionally what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  After the war, I got myself a job and another job and a third job. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">You know, I was sort of trying to find myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">At the same time, I had a child a year after I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But then I worked for a large jewelry organization, and then I got a job with the PXs in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> for several years, belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> , and we spent three years in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I came back, went to work for a company that was a manufacturer's representative all over the world because I was used to traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I'm just trying to think -- Let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">After that, I went into business for myself, made a success of the business, and retired several years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And basically, that's the story of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  Do you still think about what you saw, the sites that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  Always. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">It takes the slightest thing to remind me of what I saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  Such as what kind of things remind you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  Well, when I hear about the holocaust -- and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> , they have a <span class="BUILDING">holocaust museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Nothing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But I go down there once in a while and look at the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And a friend of mine -- I have several friends who are refuges who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And they're constantly talking about it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And they make various talks throughout the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , trying to have people to be cognizant of what went on and so on, but there are still a lot of skeptics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  Are there any sights that trigger what you saw? </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Any sights that you see today that would trigger anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Mostly Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">When I see certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> in Europe, I think of the holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I think of what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I'll never forget what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">In fact, what I've told you these are the only basic things that I remember, but so much more happened and so much more that I went through that I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And I wish I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">That's why before I came to see you I wondered what I'm going to say to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I didn't realize I knew this much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  Where did you lose your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and your diary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  Probably in -- we left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weida</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And it's with the -- whatever is left of the 628th Light Equipment records. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">It should be within that, and written by me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  So you wrote about what you saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> in this diary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  I wrote a lot of what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And I don't remember exactly when I stopped writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I just remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I thought I would see it when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , but I didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Was it a release for you to be able to sit down and write about what you saw that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I began to realize what I had saw -- seen, but for some reason or other it did not sink in until days, weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  After the war and you were back here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and word came out about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and there were more and more pictures, how did you respond to that when you saw the magnitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  That's when I began to realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">That's when I began to understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And the sights plus what I began to read about it all came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And suddenly I began to realize what this was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">You just can't look at it one time and say, well, this is a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">It isn't that simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">It's something that has to build up within you. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And now nobody can tell me it didn't happen or I don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I know I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">What I went through just trying to find out whether there was such acamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">At first I began to say there had to be an Ohrdruf. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , they told me no. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">The first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> they said they don't know of such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And you know they have all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> laid out on a map. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Never saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> until I went into the Yad Vashem. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Until they showed me the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And they had the history of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">QUESTION:  And it's a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and referred to as $3?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">QUESTION:  The first photograph that one sees in the permanent exhibit here at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is a picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Do you feel that's appropriate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  I don't quite understand you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">QUESTION:  When the public comes to the permanent exhibit here at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and they get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , the very first photograph is of General Eisenhower at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> and the scene of the bodies at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">How do you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER:  I didn't see the picture, number one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  But the idea that that's the first one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, because I knew he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Nobody could deny it, the fact that Eisenhower was there on the second trip, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Nobody could believe that this thing went on and yet people will still look at that picture and say, "It can't be that bad." </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They still do that today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  No, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">If my memory improves, maybe I'll come back again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">QUESTION:  Do you think you could have been prepared by anybody else for the sights that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">ANSWER:  No, absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Nobody -- I've told you, I read it in the Stars and Stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Not that I didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">It just didn't sink in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And that's what happens -- and I'm talking about Jewish people as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And everybody seems to say, "Well, it's not that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">It can't be that horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">There are a few bodies and there were some mean people there." </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And it existed on a mass scale because I saw how organized that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And believe me, the Germans know how to organize anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And they organized that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  You said something that was very touching, which was when you went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> and you spoke Yiddish to some of the survivors and you sat down with them and you held their hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Why did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">ANSWER:  Well, only because I was curious to know what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We knew so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">There was no history, you know, when I went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">We knew so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So as I spoke to them, I was holding one of them and because he was an individual, not because he was Jewish, not because he was anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But because he was a man who had suffered and who had been hungry and who was emaciated looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And these are men that needed somebody to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">It's just that I couldn't stay there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">That was the only thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  Were you ever concerned about your own health in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with diseases and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We didn't think of any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We just saw what we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We saw what was happening to somebody else, not to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And we looked and we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And it was just -- it was a terrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I only wish I could have realized it then, but maybe I wouldn't have slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Maybe I would have been upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Maybe I would have become a nervous wreck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">So maybe nature has its way of compensating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">That could be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Of course one more thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">When I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I see some of my relatives, my father's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And we talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And we talk about it, and we talk about what they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And they had left before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">They all went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And they all became very successful doctors and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And we discuss it very rationally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">They don't prefer to talk too much about it because they're doing well and they don't want to be reminded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But they went through quite a bit as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And I remember the first time I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we took two bags of clothing to bring to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Now they don't need my clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">They're doing very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  Any message you want to give to your grandson or any special message to your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  The truth is that my grandsons got the message by virtue of the fact that I gave them the pictures to take to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">My children, my grandchildren all took these pictures to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And what they did in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and how they reacted, they all know exactly what happened.</span></p>
