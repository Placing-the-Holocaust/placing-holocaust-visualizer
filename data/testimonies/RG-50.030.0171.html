class="sentence" id="228">I had a nice pair of horses there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I take care of the whole <span class="DLF">farm</span> because the farmer, he was a little guy, you know, and he didn't want to work hard see. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He had a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Well,when there was anything to do with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> , he was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> , you know, but with the horses the most job, you know, I was doing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He was 01:27: very glad and I was working hard and same thing Frieda was working on that little <span class="DLF">farm</span> where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">She was working fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Everything was there fine, but meantime the Gestapo told the farmer where Frieda was working...look and watch it because she had something to do with Polish guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">If you know anything, if you notice anything, let us know. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And good enough...how long you can hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Sooner or later they found...they did find out...I don't know how...that that we was together, and he didn't make any report to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So long Frieda was working there, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But Frieda make one mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She want to quit that <span class="DLF">farm</span> and go work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> , more money, more time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And that was the biggest mistake Frieda make. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And that's what the trouble start right then. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So when the little farmer where Frieda was working find out she going to quit, she call up...he call up the Gestapo and Frieda was arrested first. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we had a...we had a date at that time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That was on end of the week, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I go over there and where we usually meet, Frieda wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So I had a bad feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Something happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Is she sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But there was no way to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But I no have to wait long to find out what happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So good enough...that was I believe was on a Friday, September 19, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We was digging potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I was working on on my <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">01:29: I mean on

class="sentence" id="264">He's a hard worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He's a good man, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And he was putting down. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Then nice, not rush, the policeman was waiting till we finish and then he come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and says, Julius Noga...I was called by Julius in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Julius Noga. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I want you to dress up and pick up whatever you want to pick up and you go with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I says sir, is that Gestapo? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Ah...to

class="sentence" id="276">Dress you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Wash you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Dress you up, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I wait for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I go to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I go to my two horses, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I clap them. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I give them some more oats, a little more 01:31:30 hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I clap them. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I know...I know I no going to see those horses any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Then I dressed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He says whatever you need like shaving or equipment or whatever you need, whatever...toothpaste, brush, whatever you think, take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But don't take too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">You don't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I know I don't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So here was another very important...I don't know how much did help. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Now Polish worker not supposed to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and not supposed to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Now the Polish people was treated very...you know, Polish worker, you know...they're worse, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Like Czechoslovak, they cannot ride their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but not Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There was strict, very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So but many times when I go see Frieda on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , there was...I forget...oh probably what was it...forty, fifty...no, forty kilometer, so ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> was a little bit too far for me you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">What I was doing I go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on a on a <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> , the first one always was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and go to the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ...you know, pay extra...it was cheap, you know, that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and go wherever you want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But here we come on that <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> with the policeman and we supposed to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I delivered for him a little canned milk, see, and each time I go somewhere when he was there, he sold me the train tickets, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So the first thing the policeman asked him, did you ever sell the ticket to this to this Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He looked at me and I see in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He says never. </span><span class="sentence"

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> on <span class="DLF">Mozart Strasse</span> , Polizei Presidium that's the name was... there was a very modern <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , built in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Everything push button. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Very very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">There was no way to run away from that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So from my previous...from my last year experience I know that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> Cell Number Five...they peel the potatoes, and I knew they had enough food, so in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> before they give me the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , I asked the inspector would you please put me on <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> ...on Cell Five. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He says well, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I think Cell Five is crowded, but he call up that guard there, ask you got <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on Cell Five for one more man, and I remember that guard name...Rollinger (ph)...blond guy, tall guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He says oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for another guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They put me on on Cell Number Five, and good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We peel the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Before noon we peeled boiler potatoes and we had a salt and boiled potatoes you can eat how much you want, you know, and then afternoon whatever left over, they give us the leftover too, so that was plenty food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That was in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Short before Christmas, the Gestapo...I don't know for what reason take us, about thirteen guys, put us in a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and bring us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> closer to the previous <span class="DLF">farm</span> where Frieda's parents are. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Was the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> though, pretty 01:45; good sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they put us in an old <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I remember the the <span class="DLF">street</span> , <span class="DLF">SA Strasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And there was a very small <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , very old <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and we stayed there over the Christmas and during the winter two guys come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , a prisoner, Polish guy, and they tell us what the Gestapo do. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They hanging people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and you...it's going to happen same thing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So what should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">My gosh...this is occasion over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We might have a chance to run away from this, from this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> see. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There was two old guards and the inspector and that was the ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">how many prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They coming and going oh maybe twenty, thirty prisoners, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They coming for short time, you know, like those guys don't want to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or do some something wrong, you know, and they give them for the...they give them for the few...<span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for the few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You are no bread, nothing and no food and they keep them three, four, five days hungry, you know, and they give them good advice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Go back and work. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Next time when you come, we going to keep you here two weeks without the food or we're going to send you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so they they scared the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So now here what we're doing here...what's the what's the reason they bring us over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Nobody knows, but those two guys tell us we better run away if we got chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So how we going to run away? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There was thirteen guys all together, all Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We was on that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , so one of them was shoemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Walter was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He was a shoemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He says you...that bar in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , if we cut just one of them and we lifted it, we can go through, and there was a screen, thin screen. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">If you cut just the one, you you you can make a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You can open it, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But where we going to get the saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He says well, we got to figure out something, so next morning we go...in the morning we go on a on a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> for.. there was a big sink where we washed ourselves and then you can go <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> there and there was a guy and he had those high boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">A guy...he was just a short for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">He had 01:48: those high, high boots and then Walter looked at those boots and he says my gosh, I know...I'm shoemaker...I know this...in those boots, you know, there's strip of metal, of good steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He said maybe we can make a saw out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So Walter go and talk to him...how long you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Oh I'm here already third day. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You hungry? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Oh my gosh, I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I didn't eat for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He says look, you want to sell those boots? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Look, we give you ...we exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We exchange, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We exchange the shoes...you you need the shoes, yeah, and we give you half a loaf bread for the...good, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So we give those pieces, make a half a loaf, and we get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You'd be surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He pull out those steel plates, you know, narrow one, steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">This is a good steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Now, how we going to make a saw now? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Walter says why don't we break the shoe and call up the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Maybe they got the hammer and some nails, you know, fixed up the, you know, sole, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Pushed the button. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The old guard come...Austrian with their big mustache...yeah...he smoked a pipe, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">What is 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Oh I says Herr Wachmeister, Wachmeister 01:50: you call him, the guy...look, my shoes is broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You you got hammer and something we can fix? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I think we got something upstairs, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So he go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He come not only with the hammer and nails, short nails, but he bring us that what you call that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steel stand</span> like for the shoes, you know, _?? . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">| don't know what you call that ...like you fix the soles...you you you put on that steel plate like, you know, made like a lace (ph) or something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Steel lace I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So Walter...Walter says look. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">How we going to make it? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So we put those two plates close, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Another guy hit with the hammer and we go like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We go like this, and when they get two saws in one. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">How whether the saw going to cut now? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Now we're going to try out, and that that was the week before Palm Sunday in April 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So the very first night we start...we tried that saw, and by gosh, you'd be surprised how that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">saw</span> was cutting the bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We couldn't...we couldn't cut just like that, you know, steady. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Maybe somebody hear, so we tied the bar with the blanket and go just a little bit, slow you know, and believe me...about four o'clock in the morning...we start about nine o'clock in the evening to cut little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">About four o'clock in the morning we got that through and there was a square bar, I should say one inch by one inch thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And good enough there was not so tight together, so we cut the second one on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">There was only one cross bar in the middle, so we figured out when we cut it on the bottom, so we grab it and bend it up and this was big enough...what we had to do just to the thin screen was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ...just cut the once you know, and then we run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Then...but before we did it, we swear, we make a promise...we go all of us, thirteen guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We go out, and we all decided to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And that that night going to be Palm Sunday, Saturday before the Palm Sunday, so Palm Sunday we going to be 01:53: out. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Then that night comes, the Saturday, and we pray as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We had a supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We go a little bit early to the sleep but meantime I forgot to tell you...the very same day one of the guard come and he says he needed two men for some kind of work there, for short time, so he took two guys and they were there oh I'd say for a couple of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Then they coming back, and that <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> was already cut, so when they come back we ask, did the guard ask you something? </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Did he notice...notice anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He didn't say...he didn't ask no question, no no. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They don't know nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So tonight we're going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So that that that evening, after the supper, we go a little bit early and we're going to start around ten o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We're going to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And we already had plans, you know...I go with you and you go with him, you know...all different direction and we make agreement we going to walk, run away only by night. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">If we have to go by the by the day, we have to have either shovel or fork or something carry, you know, make believe you go to the work so you won't be stopped by the by the policemen when you go far, and the first night we got to go as far, as far away, and there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> over there and we should pass that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It wasn't very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We should pass that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> for one reason...when they chase us with the dogs, when the dogs come into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ...that's what we understand that time...they going to loose their tracks, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So that night we go early <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we wasn't...1t wasn't long we hear the guards come, open our <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and the inspector was with them, and first thing he ask why you guys

class="sentence" id="659">I tell you once you not going to be hanged and you not going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We go to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Well, good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> on the same very familiar <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , yeah, and from the from that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to the Gestapo, not to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mozartstrasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So I come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> they open a book and they 02:06: look at my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Says oh...that's the one was involved in boycotting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vels</span> ? __. </span><span

id="674">I know I'm dead man anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So I says hey Inspector, would you please do me one favor? </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Yes, what is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Would you please put me on on Cell again Number Five? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He says, ah you hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Not quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I like to peel the potatoes before I die. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">What? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Before you die? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Who told you you going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I says I got that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Ah, forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So they call up the guard and they put me on Cell Five, and thanks God, because from April after the Easter up to August Ist I believe, I was on Cell Five. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We had plenty food. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Nothing special...potatoes, carrots, carrots, beets, whatever we had, you know, but we fill up the stomach, you know, and matter of fact I I gained some pounds, you know, in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">On August Ist, on the evening, I remember, again the , you know, that tall guy, the guard come with the pink sheets and says Julius Noga. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Sign this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We already know pink sheets what means...concentration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I said so I says OK Herr Wachmeister, when? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Tomorrow? </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Yeah, tomorrow you go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And we hear something about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , that that's supposed to be tough <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I thought they going to send me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">No, but for some reason they send me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So next day, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They pick up...I believe there was forty-six of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I was the only one Pole, Polish guy in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They cuff our hands two and two, and they bring us down to the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> down below and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> without a top, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> what they usually bring the prisoners from the from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> what was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there, a new <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They bring us on a <span class="BUILDING">rail depot</span> and they put us on a on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> and that was small <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> you call it... three men or four men to the one <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , yeah, and two of them can sit and two of them stand and then we change, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So we come as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> in 02:09: <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> we stay overnight...some kind of old <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , big <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , all of us was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">There was some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we stay over night and this 1s very interesting because all documents in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and on the Gestapo, all documents from the foreigners was destroyed, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for some reason I don't understand even when you go today, when you call up, they keep that record and says Julian Noga stay over night here in a on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , and this is the only evidence there in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> where is I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Flossenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I got some other witnesses, but that's what is still, you know, the the the best proof, you know, I was on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , so the next stop was we stay overnight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Also in some kind of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and this what I meet...how should I say...my good luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">As we was there was late in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They bring a tall guy, brunette, tall guy, strong guy by the name Hans Bauer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Now Hans Bauer was in a <span class="BUILDING">German jail</span> for ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He served his term and the and he was free, but the Gestapo was waiting for him and pick him up and put him in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> like they did with all others, criminals were told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So always you serve your term in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> like Hans Bauer ten years, but the Gestapo, they decided, you know, he's too dangerous to be free so they put him in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Now he was poor, that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">He didn't have nothing and happen when I was there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> on Cell Five some of those guys will clean up on the Gestapo there and pick up the cigarettes, you know, butts, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We had plenty tobacco and we...those newcomers come and they had some cigarettes and from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> we had one guard so he bring the cigarettes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , you know, because what you say black marketing was when going all over, so I had plenty cigarettes and I had a nice bag of tobacco, so I give...he was a heavy smoker that Hans Bower. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I give him one pack of cigarettes and he was appreciate it so much and he says what is your name. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I says Julius, because they usually call me Julius. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I remember this. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Now what it was soon after we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but before we come to that, now then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> we go to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the last 02:13: <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> by the name Floss (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="721">It is close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Now there the SS with the black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> , they was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And how they greet us when we step out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...with the whips, the long whips and they call us all kind of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Lauese (ph), lice...and they pack us, you know, in that black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> there and shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we was standing so packed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and when they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , you couldn't see nothing when we was...and that was probably from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Floss</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> wasn't that far...was maybe three kilometer, not more than five kilometer and here they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We had not much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">My gosh...we see the <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> and the wires and those guards there, and and right away they put us in a <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> which was few stairs...I don't know...about five, six <span class="DLF">stairs</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">They put us there and they push us and they hit us with the whips and that's when we take the clothes off and they give us nice cold shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Of course, that was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">That was beginning of the August, but (laughter) you take a really cold shower, you feel it, and they put the hose, you know, they had a big hose with the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They put the hose, you know, just like the animals, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And they give us the striped suit what I going to show you later on, but some are striped white and blue, thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Thin fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And then they bring us on a on a newcomer so-called, new-comers <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they keep us there for fourteen days, for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The only thing they didn't give us the shoes those fourteen days and every day in the morning they call us to the Politische Abteilung, means to the political bureau, and they ask us...everyone of us...you know, one by one, all questions, you know...where you was born, where, how, this, how come, how you come over here, and they had this all reported. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But they ask you, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Then I remember just a short ...I give you example. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">There was a guy asking question. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Ah he was not even high officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He was some kind of like a corporal, SS, and he was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , you know, and play with the feet, you know...he look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He asked me question like this...you know why you are here? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I says yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Well, because I was too close friend to the Austrian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">He laugh at me and he says no. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You here to pay for those all German soldiers was killed in in a in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedgost</span> ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I know that's later on I find out because I asked so many people why, why, why he ask me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="752"><span

German soldiers was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedgost</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Now after I find out, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There wasa___.. Even before the war start, there was so many Germans living there inthe _ and Germans started it. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">When the people come out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , you know, there was some shooting, you know, something like that, so the Polish people go after, after those German and after the Germans come, the soldiers, you know...that was something very unusual and that's what he probably was there and he remembered this and that's probably...that's what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">OK, sir, if you

class="sentence" id="778">Oh gosh...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Maybe fifty, maybe hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">He let us run, run there, on <span class="DLF">Appellplatz</span> which means the roll call square, in a <span class="DLF">meadow</span> , and there was no blacktop. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">There was just a like a rough

</span><span class="sentence" id="786">I remember his number. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">He had a green triangle and his number was very low...number 14. </span><span class="sentence"

id="820">Hear the whistle somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Aufstehen somebody screamed somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Then you got to get up fast, make your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> , take your shirts off up to here, wash yourselves and make ready and go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Go out by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the block man...block man...that's the German prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He was responsible for the <span class="DLF">block</span> , for the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He count you. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There on the SS fuehrer, block fuehrer you called it...one of the SS take care of the...for instance, by <span class="DLF">block</span> was number nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">He come and the block man make a report to him, so many men go ready go to work, so many men is sick, so many die over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">We say four, five, six men die over the night, so he make this report. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Then the <span class="DLF">block nine</span> was way high as you go...in the middle the blocks was on both sides and there was hundred two <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">There was few <span class="DLF">steps</span> and there was a level ground and there was one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the other one on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and again few steps up and two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a few steps up, so I was pretty <span class="BUILDING">block nine</span> on the right hand side was I think second or third before the last one on the right hand side, so when you looked from <span class="BUILDING">block nine</span> , when you looked down to the square, to the roll call, you see everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">You see the <span class="BUILDING">cremation building</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I had a very few view from <span class="BUILDING">block nine</span> , so OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So after fourteen days they took us early in the morning and they bring us to the 02:24: <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">They give us shoes too, with the wooden sole and that's why I got the original picture because as I show here and I going to leave that picture, my picture from the first day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> hangs there today in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossunberg</span> and this is a big format of the picture, so when I was there two years ago, when I saw myself on that picture, I thought I going to faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">My legs go down and I call my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">My wife was with me, my daughter, my son and I show them that, so that was something...excuse me...and I remember exactly that time when that picture was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It was the first day in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and that was at noon when we get the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We was waiting for the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">You're going to see that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We are going to show later on, and there was a little SS, red hair with a big black camera like a like an accordion I should say (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And why I remember so good because we was joking from that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">How come they pick him up for the SS because usually when they pick up a man for the SS they got to be tall...you got to be perfect, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">But somehow (laughter) they pick him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">He was a little guy, red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Anyway, he make that picture and I remember that day and that picture was made as I can remember as I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It must be around August 18, 19 or maybe 20th that picture was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">How this picture survived, how they get it, how they put it there, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But I'm there see, and then on a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> they put me in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't remember...was four of us, six of us, few gangs like that...our job was going 1n a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> way deep with a dynamite that granite night before, and those big blocks granite...we put the chain around and the big crane was on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">He pick up those big blocks and bring on a level and then those blocks, they was cut again for the smaller pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So I was there for few weeks and that was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Some time the whole <span class="DLF">block</span> slipped, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We didn't put the chain right, you know, somehow, and there were so many accidents there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That was that was very danger(ous). </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Now why I say this picture was made in a first day in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Because on that picture I got the shoes with the wooden sole and after a while I was assigned for those Kette Kommando...put the chains on...what was so much climbing, they give me leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I remember that that was the first day in a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So after a few weeks they...for some reason one morning they put me on a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ...they take me off from this kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We call it kommando...you know, the gang. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And they put me on on cell number 12 to learn how to work out and make pieces out of the granite, so my first teacher there was another prisoner, old prisoner, a Czechoslovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Franco Cerevani_ and he teach me how there do this granite. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">What we was doing we was making the stone for the corpse, for the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> and for the kilometer posts, for the <span class="DLF">streets</span> those... in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you got though made out of the granite, little squares, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">When you see sometime those <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> made out of the granite, you know in different designs, see...those kind of squares we was making and also we was making stones for the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">For instance, many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they're made out of granite. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Matter of fact the <span class="BUILDING">Politische Abteilung building</span> there, later on we put there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Pol. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Abt. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">means the all political bureaus was there, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> commandant, wheels...they had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> there, and matter of fact I got my probably...I can't remember exactly...four or five stones underneath the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and they're in a shape like used to call them cocquils...special made. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">They stick out onthe ___ <span class="DLF">roof</span> and they're in a shape like half-rounded, you know, and two years ago I was there and I show my wife, my daughter and my son, look...I don't know which one but I know this is four or five of them, those stones, I make it, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And also we was making stones for the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">That time they build up the autostrada (ph)...the big way you call it...and by each <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on the side, those <span class="DLF">walls</span> , they was using those big blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We...there there was a name Soldaten Steine. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">That's the name was, and that's what the work was. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">First few 02:30:30 weeks that was terrible, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I thought I not going to make it see. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">My hand...you...that was all hand-work, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Point chisel and s flat chisel, you know, , , (tools in German) and mash (ph) hammer number one, number two, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">You smooth it up with the with the mash hammer. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So you start with number one what 1s rough, see, and you pound and pound and you got the brush, you know, and you brush that dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">There was no fan, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">In the evening after twelve hours when we're finished, we was full white, you know, like a bakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Remind me in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , you know, I wasn't that much white that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And then...now if you make that stone, each stone had it own term, you know...how long takes it to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">If you make that stone on on time, you have extra bonus. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We say in a week, one mark, two mark bonus, so you can buy something in the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They had a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine told me, look Julie, if you want to survive, you got to show them something what you can do and don't go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">If you go down, you come to the stage of mussulman...what we call mussulman, mussulman...they going to kick you. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They going to kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">You're gonna swell up. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">You going to die he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">All the prisoners told me that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So I really pay attention and thanks God by gosh, somehow I I did my work the best and I finished some of those stones most of them on time, getting better and better and I become professional stone cutter, and that's probably was one reason...as a good stone cutter, you know, as a low number...1623, those kapos they somehow somehow they they like you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They kick you any time, you know, but no respect, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He's a good stone cutter. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He's got low low number, you know, so sometime they skip you. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They no kick you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But that doesn't mean (laughter) you're safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">So you know, might want to know how what kind of a life was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">You hear so many stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">What should I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Gosh, that was miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">No matter what I going to tell you, you probably...half of that you're not going to believe it because I tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">If I think back right now, if I think, you know, it's hard for me to believe, you know, how this possible could be how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And there is so many, so many bad things happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The life, daily life was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">You get up four thirty...quick, quick, quick, quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And go to the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , work twelve hours, six days a week, twelve hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Sunday...Sunday before noon we do the chores, so called, you know...clean out the your <span class="INT_SPACE">lockers</span> , clean out the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , clean up yourselves and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Then we had inspection, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">If you had button missing or something like that, you was punished for that, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So 1t was clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">That time from the beginning was clean, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Oh...they cut our hair every month, and every week they cut with the clippers in the middle, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And then you work 12 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">The food was not to survive no matter how strong you are for six months, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The stronger people I saw, in a six months they die. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Like in the morning you get only half a liter, what you call a liter, black coffee, ersatz coffee so- called, made out of a bark, burnt bark. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Then when you was working in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , around nine o'clock they give you two slices of bread with margarine, as a heavy worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">At noon, as you see on this picture what I got, we had soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Cabbage, red cabbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I thought I never going to eat red cabbage in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Spinach...I says my gosh, spinach again, and that was watered, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">There was no fat to it, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So I thought as long as I going to live I never eat spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But I tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I like spinach, Once in a while (laughter) I eat spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And then after you come from the work here on the roll call square, they count you again and son of a gun...you know, every day somebody was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">No matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And they count and count and count till they find out what happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">What would happen sometime guy die or was killed in a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Many of them was killed and they forgot to to take his name off, so they find out in a...we had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We called it <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They find out the guy is in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> or they find out he is on a pile there by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , you know, but it's happened, many times happen somebody want to try run away, and that was death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">My gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Don't you try to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">If you try that, you...but I know, I know at least three guys..they run away and they didn't catch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Why they didn't catch them? </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Because anybody run away, either death or life, they bring them back right in the middle in in that square. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They put them there and says look, we we caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And when you people want to run away, we'll bring you back like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">That's was, you 02:38: know, the lessons, you know, for for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So the worst...one of the guy from this _...this 1s very interesting...there was a Ukrainian guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He was smart on one hand but he wasn't so smart on the other hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">What he did when we was working in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> ...I make the story short, we had some civilian bosses there. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Usually those guys set the dynamite there in the evening, and those civilian bosses, they had some kind of suit which you call uniform or or...there's a name for it, you know...the pants and the all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">At noon...that's right...at noon the the boss hang out this suit in his <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , and that Ukrainian guy sneak in and put that on and put his cap and he go on a side there there was a small <span class="DLF">gate</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And the guard salute to him, you know, and he let him go, and he go only about thirty kilometer. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We find out after he go about thirty kilometer and he come to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he says, he told the farmer he just come from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">He start on a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ...he don't know what <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and he want to drink the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">He was thirsty, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> go away and he lost everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">He lost the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">He lost the suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">He had a suit over there and everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">The farmer need a worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">He says don't worry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">You know, that guy is a Gemeinde Buergermeister, he's friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I make a paper for you, so he make a paper for him, you know, and everything, even the clothes you know...was everything alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Now three months after...I don't know, not even three months...he was too fresh and for some reason that farmer was fresh too, and the farmer hit him and he hit the farmer back, so he call up...the farmer call up the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">The Gestapo come. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Ah...yeah...he had a different name already, but listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">What a coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So Gestapo keep him there and give him good, you know, and this and now we're going to send you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Would you believe where they send him...to the <span class="BUILDING">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">There is now...that be alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Nobody would know nothing, but after fourteen days as a newcomers, they sent him to the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and they sent him to the same gang where he was before and the kapo recognize him and he call up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and two SS come with the with the rifle, with the bayonet, and they bring him over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">So in the evening when we come, when we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he was standing there by the pole in the center and he had a big sign in three languages...I think that was in German, in Polish and in Russian...Ich bin wieder da. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That means I come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So they keep him for a few days in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We had a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> we called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">See. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">They keep him there for a few days, and one evening we come back from the work...usually they make a show...almost every week they hang somebody...and here they carried...we had a...they had (laughter) portable gallow, gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Portable. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Two men carry them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">They bring the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Nothing new...we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Every week they bring the gallows...you know, they hang somebody and they hang that Ukrainian fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Now when they hang the guy, no matter winter or summer, he had only pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">No shirts, nothing, and the hands was tied in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They bring that guy and we find out who that guy was. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Now that was the unforgettable moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I saw so many people was hanged there and feel sorry for them you know, but for this guy particular I feel sorry be...because this is a unbelievable story, so they put him on the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">There was...the gallows was a box with the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> cut in the middle and there was a handle on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">When the guy pull out that handle so the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> goes in, you know, and the guy fall in that box and and was hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And that's what they do to that Ukrainian fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">First they read the verdict, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">The verdict, and no matter what it was, they always says for the sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Everything for them was sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So what they did...and we stood there, everybody still, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You got to stay there and and watch it, see, and they pull out the handle and the guy fall in that box and would you believe the rope breaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">The the the the rope broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Now somebody told me because we got all kind of people in a concentration 02:43: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> lawyers and judges, you know...that was an international law...I'm not sure about that but they tell us, if the rope break when they hang somebody, the man supposed to go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Those criminals...they make a knot, you know...they put that rope together and they hanged that guy second time and he was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He was...he was begging them...he's going to be good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Just keep me in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They hang him second time, and that was the worst thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  Can we go focus a little bit more on some of the things that happened to you while you worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> some of the situations that that you were the victim of while you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Like for instance this was...I think that was well, I was working in a ina <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , as I tell you before and what happened to me and forgot about think to me personally, once I was sent to the kommando...in a in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> kommando means gang...and we was pushing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> on a small <span class="DLF">tracks</span> with the dirt, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">They was building something, another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or something, and on that job I had a different foreman and he hit me with the stick over the head and he split...I still got the got the scars over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">He split my head, and I was...he was a German foreman, and I was so furious I don't care what happ...what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I take the stick from him and I hit him so hard so the blood come from the ears, you know, from him, and they catch me, the kapos, the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> catch me and there they give me a...oh my gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">They beat me so bad on there in the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">ANSWER:  That was the worst experience for for all because I thought this going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">They no let us...they no let us live through and be witness like today so I can tell to everybody what happened, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">So we we we believed they going to liquidate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That was on Friday, April 20th in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Maybe I should go a little bit back, thirteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">There was a one night the guards and the SS left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and we was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Let's see...that was about a week or a little bettter than a week before the evacuation, so one day, one night, we was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">We already put the flags, white flags you know...we surrendered, you know, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">They make a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">They circle there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">We was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But just don't run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Don't go nowheres, because in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> all over there was so many German soldier, you know, so anybody can shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">But that was short freedom, see...over the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">We get up in the morning and here you got the same thing...all the guards and even worse because they had new guards from the front, SS, and they was very cruel, you know, and they start shooting, you know, anybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">If they no like you, they shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So we was we was there for one week like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Then they was talking about the evacuation, so OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">On April 20th, six o'clock in the morning, they start evacuating two thousand men...that was probably about close to sixteen thousand prisoners that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Now three years ago when I when I come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> was not more than two thousand, not even two thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So by the end there was about sixteen thousand because we had some prisoners from Gross Rosen coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">They start evacuate us on that day, April 20th. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So the tricky was for me and few other my friend of mine, hiding and stay as long as possible in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because the American 3rd Army was so close already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">You can hear them...you can hear the shots you know, machine gun, so we're going to stay as as as long as possible in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but comes about five o'clock afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">The last column was called and many people fall on a...they they want to be sick, you know...they don't want to go, and they start shooting, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Get up or death, you know, or they shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So many people get up, you know, and they form...I don't know...was it two thousand, close to two thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Then we march. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">We're marched and how sneaky they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">They bring us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know...side roads, you know, through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">thick woods</span> , you know, we was marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They didn't give us nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">That was Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Saturday, nothing to eat, and soon we just left to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">We come to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We see there's so many dead people laying on both sides from previous columns, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Those previous...there was eight columns, two thousand each, you know, before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">All day, you know, and you see those dead people, so that was the worst thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">First of all, soon you get so tired, you know, to walk and no water, no bread, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">On Sunday we had to stop... we had to stop and they give us a little, little piece...fifteen decagram of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">No water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">No coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Nothing, and that's all what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Now each each morning...oh let's say around four o'clock, they bring us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and let us rest for two, three hours the most, you know and by gosh that was good, but so many people couldn't get up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">They was exhausted, so they was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">They were shot, and as we march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , if somebody was walking, you know, like, you know, wobbles, the guard come to that guy, push him on the side and close range shoot him with the rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Shoot him in the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">It was terrible picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">So I give you example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">From Friday till Monday noon, about four thousand prisoners from those columns was shot and I was...that last day I was ready to lay down and OK...shoot me because, you know, it was impossible, almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So and we was not even half way to the to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We was free on Monday, twelve o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">On my gosh...at noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tank</span> come with the white star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">That was emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Would you believe...oh...then we have to lay down, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Somebody give us the...somebody give us the order to lay down, and some of those guards want to run away but they was stopped by by those machine guns, American Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Third Army...General George Patton, the best man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">God give him <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So after we get up, the first thing what we was running to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> and we kissed those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">We hugged...we squeezed those American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">We kissed them shoes and we thank them for the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">That was unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">That was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">That was the biggest moment, and during those not quite four days, four thousand was shot and then we'll go back just a little while...a little back where we...there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there, Stansriedt (ph) by the name there...not faraway from _ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and we stayed there for...privately for two weeks and the Americans make a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for us and we had plenty food and we stayed there and after three weeks the Americans give me the special paper, pass and they give me <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I was thinking to see Frieda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And there's so much to say what happened in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but by gosh, you know, the cruelty, unbelievable cruelty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So many people knows so many people not believe that's happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Last week one lady call me and says you was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I don't believe you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">There was not such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So after that...
