<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And when were your born, and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born at Brigham Women’s Hospital in 1983, March 11".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Were you named after somebody in particular, and if so, what do you know about that person? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Tell me a little bit about --
ANSWER:  The D in Dustin comes from my great-grandfather David on my grandmother’s side -- on my mom’s, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And they didn’t want to name me David, but they took the D and went with a name that started with a D. My middle December 7, 2000 name, Isaac, I believe comes also -- comes after my grandfather’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My last name is artificial, it was made up upon coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And that’s my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Do you -- do you relate to the people you were name -- named after in some way? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Does it have special meaning for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I’ve seen pictures of them, but the fact that my name, it’s not a very strong connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  You do have a Hebrew name, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  I do, Davide, and that also -- that was translated. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There was no connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Okay, give me a little sen -- give me a sense of how you see your grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">What -- what -- wh-when you would -- okay, try to describe your grandfather a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">How do you see him, or how you saw him, if that -- maybe that has changed, even.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  When you sort of look back at who you as a -- as a smaller boy, how did you relate to both of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Give me a picture of who she is, or was, and how you saw him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  This is, of course, on my mother’s side, and they are both great people, but quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My grandfather, he’s a storyteller, he’s tenacious, in a good way. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He’s funny, he’s loving. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He’s done so much with his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I’m really proud of him, December 7, 2000 and there’s a lot of aspects of him which I'd like to emulate in myself when I grow older. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Not all, but a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Like what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  I admire his determination. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">His ability to stick to principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I admire how he made himself up from an immigrant to what he is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I admire his courage and strength that he exhibited during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my grandmother, she’s very loving, she’s very emotional, whereas my grandfather is not as emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The one thing I do remember him getting very upset about was I dated, briefly, a girl that wasn’t Jewish and that deeply upset him. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But that’s over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Did you understand why that upset him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  I did, I -- I -- I certainly understood where he was coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">At the time I was young and I had no -- no intentions of having a serious lo -- relationship with a non-Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That was never -- it didn’t cross my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I -- I do -- I do factor that in when I look at girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But my grandmother, getting back to her, she’s -- well actually, I actually call him Sabba, which is grandfather in Hebrew, and I call her Savta. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So ca -- 1s that -- can I --
QUESTION:  Yeah, whatever
ANSWER:  Alright, alright.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  -- you just keep on going until you -- December 7, 2000
ANSWER:  And Savta’s very loving, she’s very emotional, she cares a lot about everyone in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We’re especially close because I’m the eldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I’m also proud of her, she survived, she has a ton of interesting stories, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">She speaks seven different languages, she’s -- and just the other day I found out she knows calculus and she’s a very intelligent woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And she’s in good shape, she walks every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I’m very proud of each of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  How do you know much about who they were as -- ab-about their history, did you read their books, did they talk -- di-did they tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  I’ve heard stories ever since I was old enough to understand what they meant, about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I also read Against All Odds. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Of course, I’ve -- ve known most of the stories that were going to be in the book before I read the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My grandfather’s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he’s a great storyteller. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that, it’s coming out soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And I’ve heard a lot orally, and I’ve read a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The one thing I -- ve heard a lot about his boyhood, his childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I -- I ha -- I haven’t really -- I started reading the book, A Jewish Boyhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but I didn’t finish that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Do you think you might go actually to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> someday to sort of see where that history started, or it hasn’t occurred to you yet? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">December 7, 2000
ANSWER:  It occurred to me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> , but it would have been part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living, rather than to explore his childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But I think it would be interesting to see where he grew up, but I don’t know what remnants there are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Do you remember -- not the book so much, but do you remember parts of stories that they told you when you were a youngster, when you go back -- not now, but -- but then, when you were maybe, I don’t know, five or six or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Is there anything that is particularly strong in your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">If you could repeat that or talk about it a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a partisan fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that’s the image I picture him, and he’s told me heroic war stories and the like, and that’s what comes to mind when I think of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And my grandmother, she’s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture her as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And that’s the picture I get of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Were there some stories that affected you in a different way? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That were very difficult for you to -- to hear, for some reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  A lot of the stories I was told, they inspired me and they made me proud of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who turned on him, and he’s obviously still alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And he has the bullet wounds to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened during the war, only much later, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I learned a lot more about them through my own reading, because I’m also very interested in the Holocaust, I’ve read more than several books over -- on the issue, I’ve seen movies, and through them I’ve gotten a more complete picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I’ve visited, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and --
QUESTION:  Was that on your -- on your own initiative, or did you also learn about it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  I actually -- I -- I went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , and surprisingly they didn't teach very much about the Holocaust, I’m assuming because they took it for granted that people understood what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We didn’t have a very general history course. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But I’m aware that a lot of my friends that have gone up through the system in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , they -- they know -- they know about what the Holocaust 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They’ve learned about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Did you talk to your -- d-do you have a feeling that you knew more about -- in a sense because you knew your grandparents, or because -- or did already learn what you were taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , kind of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or than I was taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And even in the books that I’ve read, because I have my grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I got firsthand feedback.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Did he ever -- did they ever, either your grandmother or your grandfather, come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well -- to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Not when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They -- my grandfather, he 1s a speaker, he goes around and he constantly speaks at <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> , <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He came to my brother’s <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was my old day school, but I was- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore or junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he spoke briefly, and they put up a plaque.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Do you talk to some of your friends, or did you talk with -- to some of your friends about your grandparents and about your own thoughts on the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I don’t talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I’m not sure there’s so much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that aspect, I think it’s an atrocity. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">If I ever had a friend, December 7, 2000 which I haven’t, but if someone made light of it, then I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I do talk about my grandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they’re just spectacular people. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I used to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how they -- they have a very rich past, rich life. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They’re very impressive and I admire them for that, and I’ve bragged countless of times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Is that interesting to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I mean, to your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Do they want to know about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  It -- my friends were impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I -- I didn’t go into all the stories, but I -- I told them some and ther -- they’re entertaining, they’re funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I never told them any of the really sad ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  You can think for a moment, if you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Lam.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] still like to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Why didn’t I tell them sad ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to, they were meant to be more entertaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I was younger then. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I don’t think that it December 7, 2000 would have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Did it also feel sort of private because it was something that affected your grandparent’s life very, very much? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Do you feel like a little bit, protecting that part, or is that over interpreting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  I don’t feel that, but there 1s actually -- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my mother’s -- the family on my mom’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That does come to mind, I have told people that, because -- cause of they’re -- my father and my mother’s side 1s disproportional. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But did I -- I did not mention how it actually came to be and how- | me -- I know, of course, the history of how she hid up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and sh - the rest of her family was down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , with the whole remainder of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I -- I -- I mean, I never told them that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel that your -- your mother’s experience with those -- with that -- with her parents was -- was -- and hearing the stories was a little different than your own? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Did you -- is there sort of a difference that you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  In hearing the stories? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I don’t --
QUESTION:  Well, in her response maybe, to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Do you mean by her upbringing, and how -- how -- December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">That you were maybe a little bit more removed from it, I mean, that you can sort of -- I don’t know, I’m just fishing right now, to see whether -- you were listening, are you -- do you feel that you are listening to -- to your grandparents maybe in a slightly different way than your mother could?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  I don’t know if I’m listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a very strong connection to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But I’m positive they had a much more profound influence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in the other tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I was just more removed from living with them, and they came up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean, she would -- never even would have considered to date someone that was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite I -- it greatly upset my mom, and even more so my grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What does it mean for you to be Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">What --
ANSWER:  To be Jewish 1s, for me it’s my identity and for me it’s more a part of me than a religious aspect, it’s more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I would say that I’m Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I don’t keep kashrut and I don’t pray three times a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I’m not absolutely the December 7, 2000 most religious person I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And yet I strongly identify myself as a Jew, and am very proud to be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And in that sense I feel that that’s my connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  You speak Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  When -- when did you -- did you learn that in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or --
ANSWER:  I -- I did learn Hebrew at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I’ve learned some at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my dad speaks Hebrew, very, very archaically, it’s the equivalent to what Shakespeare would be to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It -- he speaks perfect Hebrew, whereas it hasn’t been modified by the slang and the colloquial of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My grandmother also speaks Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She taught it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  I’ve been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> s -- many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I love <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I --
QUESTION:  Talk a little bit more about -- about the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , what you love about it, and also about the family that you the -- that you have there, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t know where to begin about Israe -- it’s -- you know, it’s a huge topic, it’s beautiful in every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The people are beautiful, the <span class="REGION">land</span> is beautiful, the culture is beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But my family, I -- I -- I do have family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I’m not very close to much of it, except for my grandmother’s sister, whose my grand-aunt, and I’ve been -- she used to have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I was there several times, and December 7, 2000 I visit her every time I go up to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and some of my cousins, but besides that there’s some family I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  You just don’t know them well enough, or you don’t relate to them for some reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I don’t even think I’ve met all of my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about the family of your -- the other grandparents, from -- from your father’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  From my dad’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">How do you -- how are they, how do you relate to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  My -- my grandparents on his side? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I -- I don’t really relate to them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I’m not close to his mother, and his father died at a young -- when I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I wasn’t very close to him either. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was always much, much more close to my mother’s parents than my father’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And that -- that was since I was a young child. [</span><span class="sentence" id="160">indecipherable] question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  And had that to do, had -- yeah, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I just have -- always have a little follow up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Did that have to do with who they were, or did that have to do with that you just were more exposed to them, that you lived more closely to them, and then you get to know them better, or something [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  They -- they both live within a half an hour away and they’re each five hours from here, so no, we -- I went up, I saw each of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We actually always slept at my father’s mom’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I -- I -- I don’t -- I don’t connect to her as I do to my mom’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I honestly would like to be like my grandfather in so many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He’s an impressive man. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I love my grandmother on my mom’s side too, she’s very kindhearted and sweet and warm and intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And I don’t see that in my grandmother on my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I -- nothing strikes me as special about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I don’t want to say that because --

<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Was it difficult for you to sort of accept that something like that cou-could happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Did you have, sort of, questions that you wondered about things, and could you bring that up somewhere, if you had those questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I did have questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">One of my questions was my grandparents still believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It’s such a enormous event, the Holocaust, it’s not easy to just treat -- even in an interview like this -- how can someone not wonder why something like that happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And even when we see it again everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Even now it’s -- I don’t know, I -- I-I -- I feel it’s different though. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I feel like -- I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Try. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">What’s -- what’s the diff -- what’s the -- what’s the difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Between -- for me, the Holocaust, from the pictures I’ve created, from pictures I’ve seen, photographs, from movies, from books I’ve read, from my grandfather’s story, it just seems so much more atrocious than anything even now in the world today where similar things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="205"><span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> and Serbs, and -- and I just think it’s so much more terrible, and I -- I don’t know if that’s right, but I-I relate more to the Holocaust, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Let’s talk a little bit about your family now. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">How do you see -- how do you see your mom and your dad and your siblings? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Sort of describe a little bit the - the family, the relationships that you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Well, Pll start it out with my mom, cause I probably have the closest relationship with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And she’s a very warm woman just like my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">She’s very understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We -- as I child, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she was always the one that would buy me clothes and take me to get a haircut. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I was always closer to her than my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I used to play games with her and chess and every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I’m very close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">A couple -- and part of 1t was because I had a girlfriend that was, in addition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And my mom and her didn't get along at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And that, maybe my mom’s work, other aspects led to tension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she’s had a shorter fuse and been more irate. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But now I -- now that I broke up with her, my -- my ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they are much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I’m very close to my mom again, I hardly fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">With my dad also, I don’t - we used fight all the time, it used to be an issue of he’d say do this, I’d no, I don’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now, I -- I -- I help out. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">You know, he instilled in me a set of values that’s th -- what the two of them really wanted to achieve, and I think they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">December 7, 2000 His main goal was to leave a legacy behind, and I think he accomplished that, and I get along with both of them now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  In terms of a legacy, in terms of what, a f -- a family, a profession of life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  His legacy on my -- my dad’s legacy would have to be one of principle. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My grandfather’s -- of course he wants to leave a legacy behind, and that is of the Holocaust and his survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And he feels, and I feel the same way, that he shouldn’t survive to see his heritage lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  Do you feel that you want to contribute, or that you can, or that you even should contribute to that in some way, to keep memory alive, somewhat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  I certainly do. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And I don’t doubt for a second that I will be telling my children and showing them in the movies, and reading them the books, of course when they become old enough to be able to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And teaching them about the Holocaust too, because | think it’s extremely important that they know what their heritage is and where they came from.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  I do want kids, and I would like them to remain Jewish as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I, myself, when I was dating a non-Jew as I mentioned -- I would never marry a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">If it was a non-Jew I was dating seriously, I would exp -- implicitly -- although I would have to bring it up at one point, that she would convert to Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">If I had a daughter, I would want her to marry a Jew, as well as if I had a son, although I’m not sure I would disown them as I’ve often been threatened myself by my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I would be very disappointed, and I think that would put some tension on our relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I hope though that won’t be an issue, and I hope to raise my daughter with the notion that that’s how it should be.</span></p>
