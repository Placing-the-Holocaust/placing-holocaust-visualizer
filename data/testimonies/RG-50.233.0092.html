<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  I’m sure your father and mother weren’t among them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My father never mixed in politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">That’s how it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Once the Russians went by -- they went by and the next day they send in people to run the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The mayor became one of the -- our own people sitting in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in the north somewhere belonging to the communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They came back, they let out the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , one of them became a mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He rode a horse and became a mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They figured he was a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So they gave him the honor of being a mayor but not for long, a week or two, then they appointed their own; they brought in their own people to manage the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">A little bit later, they brought their families and they took over the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where the Polish officers used to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Later on they even took over <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> and they settled the Russians and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They nationalized the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  What was the first effect on your family or yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Well the effect was positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">First of all, my parents come from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and with the Russian army, they could communicate and then they started to organize different <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> , everything under the government control. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They were looking for anybody with managerial experience and my father was pulled in right away in a good position.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  He had experience and he could speak Russian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Experience and he went into a grain concern that the Ukrainians had established. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">A grain concern and they knew about him and they took him in to manage a certain thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then he took me into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and that’s how I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I worked there almost two years in the bookkeeping department.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Was that also a positive experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes, very positive because they treated the Jews very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You know the Russian authorities at that time, most of the occupiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The officers, the big and even the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was a very positive thing for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was very positive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Poles were looked a little bit down because the Russians said that they came to liberate us from the Polish yoke or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So the Poles had a difficulty of getting a good position. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Also then a couple of months later, they established everybody from 16 years and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We had to go to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">People went to register according to their professions, whatever they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the passport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would be marked son of a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">With that passport you couldn’t land a good position already because you were considered a capitalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">That’s how they marked the passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or Ukrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">All my friends that their parents were in business and they had problems getting jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Being that my father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him I was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about being indoctrinated about communism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Oh yes, sure, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They had lectures, <span class="BUILDING">public lecture forums</span> that you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">At that time already it was a few months after they established already their rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">As a matter of fact, they have it in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">One of the lectures that I remember, we worked in the grain concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Most of the grains were being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">At that time already, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> took two-thirds of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they took one-third. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They divided between themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But at that time already there was a little friction between both of them somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There were not such good relations and yet they were shipping all the grains out to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I remember asking that question to one of the officers that was giving the lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They had special propaganda men that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I asked him, how could we ship to them the grains that being they’re already trying to tell us that they’re not friends, they’re like enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They’re trying to build up their thing against us or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts that we give them are negligible but from our concern most of them went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He says we have to buy time to be prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They were preparing the <span class="DLF">building airfield</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  I look forward to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">What was the first clue that there was an invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  The first clue was that I usually meet my friends like I got up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We had no radio in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Very few people had radios; telephones, only doctors and professionals would have a telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Got up at eight o’clock, it was a nice sunny day and I went to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , a 15 or 20 minutes walk and I went to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Close to nine o’clock usually my friends would show up already and nobody’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Here and there, there’s somebody there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Go for a swim by yourself, how much can you be in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> by yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I go out just waiting for people to show up so we usually play cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Then somebody around ten o’clock, somebody shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He says what are you people doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Don’t you know there’s a war? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That’s how I found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Actually they bombed already <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> at four o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Four o’clock in the morning, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> was bombed, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , quite a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">That’s how I found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Were you mobilized or --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Well, in 1941 people one year older than me were mobilized in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Their year was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized like in March and April already, they went to be inducted. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">At that time when the war broke out, they didn’t mobilize any more except whoever was still around who was not sent away to the points where they <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you, they would send them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to evacuate. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">The first week was normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They attacked but they were holding their ground for the first four or five days or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But then they broke through the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and it was disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The first week we were still going into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already, mobilizing some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> if they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">In our concern too, the director was taking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> , putting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and stuff and sending family back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We were just standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was communist or something, they didn’t want to take chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I think the second week already, it was like they were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> full with soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">People tried to get rides with them; some did, some couldn’t succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Again my family wouldn’t think of running; not only mine, the majority didn’t think of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Even though we knew that the Germans, they’re against the Jews but nobody thought of something happening whatever happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  Had you heard any stories about Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Of course we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We heard stories from the other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> what they were two years already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">That they mobilized some people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They worked them for nothing; some guys, sometimes they cut somebody’s beard off and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There was no concentration camps, there was no -- at that time there was no extermination, nobody even thought about it in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">After they attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , they started there too, they started to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Were there refugees coming through your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We had German refugees; they were coming in 1938 yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="338"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> threw out Jewish people that their ancestry was from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They brought them up to a <span class="BUILDING">Polish border station</span> and left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then different communities tried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , some wound up by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Most of them had some family or some relations, they came here but some didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Some were trying to actually work their way to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They figure they go to the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , maybe they’ll be able to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We had quite a few refugees here. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Again, that was the worst thing that happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They threw them out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with Russian soldiers going through and kind of fleeing --?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Then your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed, soon after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed right at the end of the evacuation when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> were still fighting each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Do you remember seeing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying overhead?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Yes, they need him for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">My mother was pleading and crying and pleading. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We didn’t live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It wasn’t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they came here, they had to cross a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> --. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The minute they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , me and my sister, we were hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or somewheres in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and they took my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">My mother was crying and of course we thought he’ Il never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He didn’t show up till late in the evening, he came back which it was like a miracle too. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">He says they did take him to work something by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , whatever he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Him and whoever else they caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He says they didn’t beat him and when they finished whatever they were doing; they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was the first experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Second experience with the Germans, the next day already.. We didn’t go any more in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> because there was no more shelling already so we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We still didn’t dare to go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Now I don’t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> pulled up in our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They stopped on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and some of them came into the -- we had like a <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the front and they put in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">They were knocking on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> ; evidently they were shown where Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly guys and they were from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Evidently they were asking where Jews are living not because -- we didn’t know, the minute we saw these things we tried to run down the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> over there by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But my mother stayed out and what they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Because they couldn’t communicate with the other people and most of the Jews knew German somehow because the Yiddish and German is very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with them and they want us to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They want the women to cook for them the stuff and they should have their break and eat and then they go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">That’s what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Who cooked for them?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  This was like Rosh Hashanah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  This was already Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Rosh Hashanah we didn’t pray because it was that time when it happened that they --. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We prayed there, people prayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">All of a sudden somebody came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and said that Ukrainian police is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They see Ukrainian police coming up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Everybody ran, you know, they took off the prayer shawl and went to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Some from a little further away, they had to stay, disperse a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That’s what they were coming, to check if Jewish people praying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  Had there been some decree that Jews weren’t allowed to pray?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  There were a lot of decrees but this was right -- was only a day or two away or three from where they -- we didn’t even go out nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Then there were decrees, a lot of decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I think within the first week they started decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">First the Jews had to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They imposed the Jewish community leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Otherwise they came to the -- there was a Jewish vice-mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The vice-mayor was Jewish, he was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They came to him and they said you better organize a Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  The Ukrainian police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  No, no, the Germans, already the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">There was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and they found out who was the vice-mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They came to the leader’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they says we want in 24 hours we want a Jewish community leadership so we can communicate and give directions, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They had a problem to organize it because people didn’t want to serve on it voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They don’t want to be involved with the Germans at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Because you expose yourself once you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">This vice-mayor tried to get some of his friends and acquaintances and little by little they organized a community leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Then the Germans had proclaimed announcements all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Posters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Posters, yes, that we had no announcing on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They had special <span class="NPIP">places</span> with their posters and that’s how you announced everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Every <span class="DLF">street</span> had different <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they announced what’s going on and that the Jewish people have to register at the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> in order to receive food stamps, rations, food rations; otherwise you have to be registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There was no kind of register, you would not receive rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They didn’t say you would be punished or something just have to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The same thing, the gentile population had an announcement. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They have to register in their <span class="NPIP">places</span> wherever so most of the people went to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">When you registered, I didn’t go, my father went and he registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They asked him his profession from before and address and everything and he registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Then I think a week or two later you had to go and pick up the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It was very small rations that they gave you. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Whatever they gave, the Jews got half of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Then every day different posters. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">If anyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">You cannot walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , any Jew cannot walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Every Jew must have an armband with the Star of David, a white armband with a blue Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to be worn on the left arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Again, different -- no Jew can have a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">If he has a business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians took the businesses away and there wasn’t that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">They still had businesses, there were some their <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were nationalized so they were talking about these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> ; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Then the Ukrainian took it right over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Over how many weeks did these decrees pass?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  It was maybe the second week the Germans were already here. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Right after the second week or so or the end of the first week, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It was very fast, very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You could not own a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Jews cannot own a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Then again you could not be found in a gentile’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You cannot marry a gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">All kinds of laws; every day a few different things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was very restricted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Do you remember your family turning in anything in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It was later, we had to turn in fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That was November, December, they announce on posters that every Jewish family has to turn in all their fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They have to bring it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> so they can collect it for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They were fighting already in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , they got stuck for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They needed that and of course, in those days you could see a lot of smoke going through the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We were burning fur but everybody had to turn something in because they knew every family has fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We buried some in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Some furs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  My father buried some fur, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Because he didn’t want to give it away -- probably still there today. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Whatever we turned in, my mother had a nice fur coat, I think it’s in that book, in the picture but she had given it away already a little bit before that to one of the Ukrainians that worked with my father before. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He took me in for like two or three nights to stay over his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I had to report to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for labor already. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My mother wouldn’t let me go and my father took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They kept me like two, three days and she promised them a fur coat so my father brought her fur coat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That was before we knew that we had to give away fur coats.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  Was there a marked change in the Ukrainians themselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Before when the Russians were occupying the <span class="REGION">area</span> , the Jews and the Ukrainians were getting along?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Was there anything else significant that happened between that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, a lot of things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You know again it’s with our registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">When we registered for the food rations, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community building</span> had a list of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There were some people they didn’t register. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The only people they did not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn’t make it to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">One guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn’t want to be exposed at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They were in hiding like and they didn’t register. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Because they didn’t want anybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing they would call to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They were part of the Russian establishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So with those names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in October, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we found out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I think it was in August, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">In the book I have it exactly, it might have been August. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150 from different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They told the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us they took them to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">This took away the leadership, the intelligentsia; it was the people that they could be a potential leadership or something, that knocked out 99%. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They left a few single doctors, surgeons, they left a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Like lawyers, 1t was only the vice-mayor that he was the chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I don’t think there was any other lawyers left that I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">With one shot they knocked out the cream of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of people to go from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , somewhere 80 kilometers away or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We didn’t know at that time where. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Of course, they came and brought- no, they got our name too. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We had a notice that I had to report next day to the Judenrat to go to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Again, you know, was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> between my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">My mother didn’t want me to let me go; my father said well Pll have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">In the meantime they are preparing a knapsack for me with food and clothing whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They didn’t know for how long; I think they said for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Then you’ll come back and other people will take your <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The decision was finally that no, I should not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">That’s when I went to that <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian’s house</span> where I stayed two or three nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It was my mother’s idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">My father was -- he didn’t, he couldn’t decide one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">It was just a plain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , they didn’t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there; a lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The work they were doing had nothing to do with labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They were moving tremendous sizes blocks or stones or whatever from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, up a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , down a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was in the winter, people came back frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They were lucky they came back frozen because they were bought from the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They went and paid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They didn’t want to go, they came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was Jewish police already, and they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">There was no question, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">These people they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes frozen up completely, more than one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Did your father ever get called for labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  No, my father -- they called a certain amount of age groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Like from 18 to 30 or something like that -- my father at that time was already fifty --, was born in 1890, so he was already 52 years old, 51. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They wouldn’t call him; they first called the people that could do labor.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  They also took women. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They took my sister a few times to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">There was quite a -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was like a county seat. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">All the main <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> from the German authorities were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , was in that state like in that part of the <span class="REGION">county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They had police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they had all kinds of different civilian authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">All these people needed labor for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They were taking some to clean <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for the Germans; they were taking women, young girls or women. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">To do heavier labor, they would take men. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">If some <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was short of some kind of labor, they’d tell the Judenrat, I need 50 people today, I need 30 people today and they would have to supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Q Was there any violence at that time against Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Well, there was, but again it was on a very small scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The Germans used to come at night even though there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet but they used to come in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They would come to a certain <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and take away the silverware and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They would just come and take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Some would walk in dogs and they would see a Jew with a beard, they would let the dog go and sic him or they’d catch one, they’d cut his beard off in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">They wanted to beat somebody, there were cases where some people were beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">That’s why I tried not to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at all, not to show myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Being we lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , we didn’t live in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">People that live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had no choice because the police were there, the others were there and that’s where they were walking, day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They also had the -- 1t was something like nobody could have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They went into one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they spotted a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So they took the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">First the man that had the radio went away, they found a radio, he went out, he went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They said if they don’t find him, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> would not find that man, they would kill the people from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I don’t recall already what happened, did they shot the whole family or did they got the man back because word came to him about how they’re going to kill the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Also later, with the fur, they caught some fur in somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they killed the family, the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But on a scale like, a big scale, no, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in April? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">A The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in April, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  How did that come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Well they hung out posters a few weeks before that, I think it was the first week of March or something, that by April 1‘ all the Jews from surrounding <span class="DLF">streets</span> which are not on the map and they included the map where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would be, have to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">If they wouldn’t be out, they would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Everything was under the threat of being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">The same thing to the gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">If they lived in the parts where there’s going to be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on those <span class="DLF">streets</span> and if they’re found there after the 1‘, they would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The majority of movement was from the outskirts in, not from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> out because very few gentiles lived in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ; the majority was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But some of them did leave there to go out, find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  So you had to leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I guess?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  We had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my father had an acquaintance that lived in the part that was going to be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He let us have one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He says we could use the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> together with his wife or whatever, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Of course we had so much belongings and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that we couldn’t put it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We had to put it in his <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , everything went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  You were able to take most of your things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  Yeah, you could take anything you wanted if you had where to put it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  You, your mother, father and sister shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  We shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It was like about three or four families in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Was a one-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and a family in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> living too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  Was this ghetto barricaded in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  No, actually they had two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was on the small part, it was a very small section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It was maybe, maybe a fourth of the size of the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">What I say main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is, there were separated by one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">That <span class="NPIP">side</span> was separated and there was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> running through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from one end to the other, to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">The majority was on the right side of that thing and we were on the left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Of course, we could not go from one to the other except during the day, certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We were not allowed to be from six o’clock on or five, I think from six o’clock on, we were not allowed to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was a curfew like for the Jewish people, you could not be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">If they caught you on the <span class="DLF">street</span> you could be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">In order to cross from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the other, also you expose yourself because there was the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian police traffic and very seldom did I venture from here to there except on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">On a Sunday, the Germans did their thing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and it was like a -- there was no business going on like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I ventured on a Sunday to the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I had a lot of friends there and on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  You would still report to the <span class="BUILDING">Judenrat office</span> to get rations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Well rations were given till the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Like in the beginning there were rations going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established there was no rations for Jews, they did away with rations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  So food became relatively scarce?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Oh, food became a very difficult thing for some people, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">People had to trade whatever they had, their belongings; would go to the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and trade with the gentiles and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They would come to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and barter this for that but most of the people still had something. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">But then after April 1*', they started to bring into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , people from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> , from little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , not little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where the Jews were killed already, from little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They didn’t want little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Their plan was to concentrate in biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> so they can get to them better. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They brought in more people and that made it worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Not only just with food, there’s no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">People slept in <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> ; it was a pity for those people that they came from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We were in already there with people, more or less established. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But it didn’t last that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions, they started actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the actions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Well, again it’s -- if I have to tell you details, it would take a long time and you’re probably going to pick something what you want from the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I have it detailed exactly and it’s a fast reading book, no matter what and it’s also not so pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I also have an account that I copied from the Memorial Book from one girl that she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">She was actually caught on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the same day when my sister and father, we were all taken out together from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But it’s a long story and I don’t know if you want to -- specially if you’re going to have there exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">You eventually were deported, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  No, no, I wasn’t deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">From our <span class="REGION">territories</span> they did not take any to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">If they would have taken maybe some people would have remained, people that could have lasted or were strong enough to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But they did not take to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They killed them right there on the spot and they had special <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , on the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> where the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> was built, they made <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> there, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  How did you manage to avoid the --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  Again, it’s a detailed story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Ill get that from the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Mostly it’s my mother had a big part in it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Probably if not for her, I don’t think I would be able to manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">She got into a few different situations where she knew some people and we bought our way out or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Otherwise I’d probably be there, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Had you heard about the Anslagrupen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Of course, of course we heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They were doing it; there were rumors just before our actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There were rumors that they were doing it in the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Right over the <span class="DLF">border</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> where they’re going with those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they put the exhaust systems and they take the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">By the time they come to where they tell them they take them, they’re half dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  What about liberation for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Well, that’s -- I was liberated by the Russian soldiers but actually taken out of a <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Not just me, about eight people, we dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  It’s incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">You dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  No, we dug a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide before for a couple weeks and then we had to come out toward the end when the Germans were retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We knew it’s a matter of days, we were in the <span class="DLF">open</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I was in the <span class="DLF">open</span> most of the time, on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide between when the fronts are going to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We were discovered in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; we didn’t want to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We dug a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we thought nobody would be looking; then went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The next day after we went in there, the Russians came through and we did not know for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was liberated already for ten days or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  You were still --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  We were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We had prepared food and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Then we had to go for water more. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It’s a --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  Very compelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Finally we came out of the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and the soldiers were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Was a Jewish officer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Somebody came with them that knew that we are there but they didn’t know exactly where. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">He came and he was a few hours there trying to find us in which <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was dangerous for them to be there because again, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , 1t was the center of the Ukrainian nationalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They were fighting the Russians and the Germans because the independent <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> lasted only three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">After that, the Germans annulled it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They were already against the Germans and special for the Russians, they were against the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It’s a story, the liberation itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It’s a separate chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  How long did you remain in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> after ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Not too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">First of all whoever we knew, the gentile people didn’t -- they were not so happy we even came, to see anybody survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">We had like I say about ten thousand Jewish people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> before and there was about 50 or 60 survived from the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Some survived that they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ; they managed to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Some survived, maybe 150 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But the few that survived, we didn’t want to be there because everything was against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I managed to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the concern opened up and I met somebody that worked from before, just one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">She was happy to see me, it was a Russian woman, very happy to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But then again it was a problem with the army and I didn’t want to leave my mother alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  Your mother survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
