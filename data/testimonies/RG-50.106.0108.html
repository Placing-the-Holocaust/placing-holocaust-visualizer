QUESTION:  And your name currently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Wallace A. Witkowski.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And the date of your birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  January 12, 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And place of birth? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">September 1, 1998
ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  In the previous interview, you spoke briefly about leaving Communist <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to join your father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Could you talk about what you remember that it felt like to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Yes, if you humor me for a second, it just struck me as you were introducing this interview, that today is September one, and to me it is a very emotional date, for more than one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">First of all, as I may have put in my earlier interview, this is when my childhood essentially ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I was 11 and a half and the German armies marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">By a curious coincident, although I don’t believe there are coincidence in — 1n creation, last September one my mother died at the age of 94. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Now —
QUESTION:  That was just one year ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  So this is the first anniversary of her death?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Today is the anniversary, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But of course — and he was located with a mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> , across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose September 1, 1998 and liquidated its activities and most of the people returned to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the <span class="INT_SPACE">United States cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a — where are we and obviously trying to bring us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My mother received that from the government, who — which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists could solidify their grip on that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and join her husband in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was 20, my sister was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So I determined to escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish coal freighter</span> , which was leaving Polish port city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdynia</span> and was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my <span class="REGION">native land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">To me it was escape from a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , which was becoming worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">September 1, 1998 And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And of course, I managed, I succeeded, my sister didn’t and was caught by the communists and briefly imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I think I described in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and trying to locate my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, then you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with your father and later joined by your mother and your sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Sister having to wait several years before the gradual mellowing of the communist government permitted her to leave legally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Did you speak English when you arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  I had two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> English, so you can appreciate. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">A similar experience to American kids learning foreign languages in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It is essentially a very, very superficial knowledge of — of language. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I walked around with a dictionary in my hand wherever I went, so that I — you could — I could look up words and communicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  You were how old? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">September 1, 1998
ANSWER:  I turned 21, you may recall from the interview, I managed to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> three days before my birthday, my 21“ birthday, on which the then American immigration law would cut me off as a minor child of an American citizen and would make me wait for a number of years before I could get under a Polish quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But up until January 12, 1949, I could come in non-quota, and I made it within three days before the deadline. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was very fortunate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  So you were able to become a citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  In due time. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I — I — in thr — the law at that time — I was married in 1951, two years later, and as a husband of an American citizen, I didn't have to wait five years, I could become a citizen after three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But I did not automatically become a U.S. citizen as a minor child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  So, you arrived, you’re living with your father, and you don’t s —
ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  You don’t speak very much English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  And I am several years older than my contemporaries, because the first thing that I did is to enroll again in an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> , and had [indecipherable] to be sure, and try to graduate from an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> , even though I was already September 1, 1998 a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> , and I had attended first semester of a <span class="BUILDING">polytechnic</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Okay, what year did you enter <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  I mean, what year of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , what class were you placed —
ANSWER:  O-Oh, the senior year, senior year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Senior year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The following — the following May I graduated, or June. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I went through the <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> rituals, including the prom and — and all the attendant other traditional activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  And how were you received by other kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  The other kids were very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Curious, open, positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was especially more — more reflective, more thoughtful. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Kids tried to befriend me, tried to learn something from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I-It was very interesting and very positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I have encountered absolutely no — no negative reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Were there other refugee children in your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  In my particular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I found some other people who survived the war from Europe in my college years at <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">September 1, 1998
ANSWER:  [had one particular friend, whose name of course, now escapes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But at the time, I discovered that he was a young Jewish boy, maybe a few years younger than I, but who attended the <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> , who told me about his war experiences, and he was Jewish and his mother, in the last couple years of war, kept him in a barrel somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It — and he lived in a barrel and that stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But in <span class="BUILDING">Hamtramck High School</span> , it was just the typical <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Proud, and loafers with pennies in them and stuff like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  What appealed to you in particular about being in that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , having those friends, being in that teenage — well, you weren’t a teenage — but being — it was a teenage culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Oh, the girls were very pretty by my standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  And I — that was probably the most positive thing and — and I remember — I was just reflecting on it recently that I took to the prom a lovely Hispanic looking girl that was just absolutely beautiful and I barely knew her, but I asked her to go to the prom with me, and she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The negative feelings were awareness of great loneliness, because I didn't really fit with the crowd, didn’t do anything with them, e-except encountered them in — in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I did achieve a sort of a fame September 1, 1998 when in the <span class="BUILDING">speech class</span> , by good old — run by good old Mrs. Homestead, I was given an assignment to learn and recite a poem, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And in perfected English, which came with considerable difficulty at the time, I managed to impress the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Forget what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">How do I love thee, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  And so it took awhile before you were comfortable with English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  There are two curious stages that I believe not only I, but a number of people that I spoke, who — to — to who were in a similar situation, go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One is, you begin to — I—I forget which came first. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You begin to dream in English and then you begin to think in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Maybe thinking comes first and then you begin to dream in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then you make this great, slow transition that 1s so wonderfully described by a woman who became quite a celebrity, the author of the book, “Lost in Translation,” Eva Hoffman. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I enjoyed that book very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Very, very similar experiences in some ways, and in some ways different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Within two years, because in spite of the — in spite of being with the father, I felt estranged from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He wanted me to be 11 year old that he left behind, and I was 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So that may have contributed to my th — early decision to — to marry, and I met a lovely Polish American girl who spoke Polish and whose parents were very, very interested in her marrying a — a Polish fellow, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So I did that, sort of — well, September 1, 1998 this was the first girl I knew really intimately and so I married in 1951, and th — even though we were both in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , the children came. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">First my son, born in ’52, then my first daughter, born in ’53.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  And what are their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Matthew and Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  So those are not Polish names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Well, he was called Maczik(ph) and she was called Elzunia(ph), which is in a diminutive form, Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  But their actual legal names were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Oh, Elizabeth and Matthew. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Which is curious because the two girls born of the second marriage, 20 years later, have their legal names in Polish, even though their mother was not Polish at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  So was that mainly your idea, or mainly your wife’s idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  No, I — I went along with the — with the — it was a joint decision of the wife and — and myself to — to give them that — that identity, which first they hated and then they loved it when they discovered — my daughter, my middle daughter, Krisha(ph) got into the <span class="BUILDING">University of Virginia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlottesville</span> , I’m convinced, by writing a very beautiful essay on how to — how it feels to be a child of — of the Polish immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And that was a very impressive piece of writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">September 1, 1998
QUESTION:  So, with your second family you were more focused on your Polish roots, would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t say that that was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">If anything, in the second family, I was more focused on being a better father, because the second family — the first family was — and life of the first family was characterized by an intense effort to become Americanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">To learn the language, learn the language well, be able to command it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">After all, I decided to become a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the second and — and the — and the fathering or the parenting was largely traditional in the first marriage and — and largely unexamined. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And so I now, in retrospect of 70 years of age, I think that I was a much better father second time around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Going back to your earlier years in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , how did you decide to go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I was first interested in speech and government and I studied a number of courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But by chance again, which I don’t believe in, I was offered a job as a young assistant to two elderly gentlemen who were conducting a Polish radio program on <span class="BUILDING">WJLB station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">At that time this was one of the <span class="BUILDING">booth stations</span> that specialized in ethnic programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And every morning there were one or two hours of Polish language programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Music, news, advertising. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I started as a September 1, 1998 — of what you call today, a disc jockey. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then finally wound up, while already in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and using a nom de plume, giving news commentaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  What was your nom de plume?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Well, Jan Alexander, which was sort of a compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It could have been Polish, it could have been some other nationality, so we — we — I deliberately fudged it a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Did you — you choose the name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I think — I think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Some — something struck me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I seem to recall that the reason I chose it was deliberate, but it was a connection to either the Polish — first Polish newspaper which — which was published in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> over 300 years ago, or s — in — there was some reason, there was some rational — there was some rationale behind choosing that particular assumed name to broadcast under. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that was, at that time — however, I looked at the broadcasting and I did not see much future for the ethnic broadcasting, I felt that 1t would keep me a little bit too much in the ethnic community and I wanted to — not to limit myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I married —
QUESTION:  Wh-When you were broadcasting, were — were you broadcasting in Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  In Polish, yes, so I continued my Polish and that’s why I was — I was picked by the owners of the program because I had good diction, good ra — what we called the radiophonic voice and therefore they thought that was a good addition of a good, September 1, 1998 fresh voice to their broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And the young lady that I married, her father was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And so I worked part time in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> as a clerk, and then I thought hm, I like dealing with people, I like helping people, I— why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And so I — by that time I was in the third year of my college education at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wayne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And at that time <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> had a so-called combined curriculum. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">If you could maintain a certain level of grades, B minus I think it was, in the first year — first three years of undergraduate studies, you could go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , and assuming that you maintain your level of grades in the first year of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , you would then receive credit for the f-fourth year of undergraduate sta — study and get your B.A., which is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And then two more years and then I had my L.B., which was later changed retrospectively to J.D., juris doctor, doctor of laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  And where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Same <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> , since I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State</span> in 19 — from the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And for the next six years, I joined my father-in-law in private practice, which was mostly probate and real estate and very simple neighborhood ethnic — ethnic practice because obviously we turned our bilingual skills into assets by — by working with the Polish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So you often dealt with your clients in the Polish language? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">September 1, 1998
ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Towards the last two years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , around 1960 or so, I was even appointed by two successive mayors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> as a member of the community relations commission, which was a so-called racial commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="149"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> had a very checkered history of racial relations and they wanted some — they — they — people appointed people to these commissions. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They wanted representatives of ethnic communities to kind of dialog and — and work together on racial problems of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But then, of course, I had to resign from that commission and give up my practice when in 1962 I was offered a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , which was to last three years, and it was again in — in the area of both languages, because it was handling the claims for World War II losses by the — by the American nationals who suffered these losses in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and it required knowledge of Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Now these would be American citizens, probably of Polish descent who had property [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Most of the claimants, interestingly enough, were survivors of the owners of property in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , very often relatives, a substantial number of them Jewish, who laid claims to compensation for reasons that the whole family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was wiped out by the Nazis, that they were the next of kin now. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But there were a number of requirements. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The ownership of the property in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had to be established to — ownership had to be established that it — let me start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Owners had to be September 1, 1998 American nationals at the time of loss, they could not have had it — it’s a legal issue that I don’t go into because it — I don’t think it’s — it’s too technical. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">If someone subsequently became an American citizen, it didn’t count because he was not a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the time of loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The language of the agreement between the United States government and government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , communist government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> specified that these losses, these claims will be compensated only to the extent to — to — to — to which the owners were Americans at the time of loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Do dogs bother you, Marcia?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  And what appealed to you about taking this job, this position?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, two things, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , the capitol of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">An opportunity to broaden my experience as a lawyer, and a certain prestige that went with being selected as an identifiable Polish American to work on — on the Claims Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And the content of the work, did that have appeal for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  That was very, very appealing from the point of view, not only being interesting, but also permitted me to utilize my knowledge of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my knowledge of Polish history, my knowledge and insight into — of character of many of these losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Maybe not so much the character of the losses as being able to deliver to my government a — a f—a-—a sort of a sober objective, hopefully, assessment of not September 1, 1998 only the possibility that these people really lost claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There were a lot of outrageous claims that were based on total fiction sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And being able to — to assist my superiors in saying that this 1s not probable, we better check this through our <span class="BUILDING">field office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And in fact, in 1963, within a year, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for three months to help run the <span class="BUILDING">field office</span> that was verifying claims of American citizens by going through the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , checking the land records if they existed, checking, investigating with the neighbors and people who still lived there, whether such and such family really owned the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> or really had the <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> or — or — or owned the — an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , and that was very rewarding, I-I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  And what did it feel like for you to be back in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  It was also very gratifying because I went on official passports, so it’s a native boy who — who did well, comes back with the official U.S. passport, not the tourist passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And I was given all the privileges of the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and I — 1-1t was an accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did you have friends and family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Oh, I had many, many aunts and first cousins and we got together, it was a great time. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was also a lot of fun, in addition to working very hard and trying to — trying to adjudicate — not adjudicate, but recommend an adjudication of these claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So it was a very good experience, from a professional point of view, which later qualified September 1, 1998 me to be offered a job in <span class="REGION">Western Pacific</span> when — when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> in °70, which I men — may have mentioned before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  I don’t think that’s on your previous interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Maybe I skipped that altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I was already working for the Federal Trade Commission, when a general counsel from the foreign claims settlement commission called me and said, we would like to offer you a job in <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> , and I said micro-where? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And of course I agreed, provided they borrowed me, as one agency borrowing an employee from another, so I could return to my steady job. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And for three years I worked in the <span class="REGION">western Pacific</span> , on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saipan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I was a member of the Claims Commission at one time — well, I was a vice-chairman of the commission and at one time even an acting chairman when the prior chairman was sacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But that permitted me to still extend my experience to a rather exotic <span class="NPIP">location</span> and assignment and — and continue my — my — my mosaic of — of legal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I was dealing with very — what we would call in this society, primitive societies. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But I discovered it just because it was not a society that maintained good written records. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Claims and stories that they gave us were absolutely accurate and we developed a system of — of dealing with claims similar to the one that we did when we were dealing with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">What stuck out of the profile of a typical claim September 1, 1998 required greater scrutiny than — outrageous claim required considerable degree of proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Do you think that your experience during the war had anything to do with your feeling about working for fairness and justice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  I felt very righteous doing the right things. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I was not involved, thank God, in any le — any professional activity that would really be testing my values, or causing a crisis to me in what I believed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I felt very righteous. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">In fact, I remember on a very crucial precedent decision that the commission issued, I sided with two native commissioners against two American commissioners. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And because there were five members of the commission, the — the majority prevailed and — and I was the swing vote. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I felt very good about it, when trying to look at the values from the point of view of the island culture and not from the point of view of American society’s values and — and — and culture, because the loss that these people suffered was a loss in their minds, in — in — in their terms, on their terms — no, in their terms, a-and that had to be addressed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Very good. [</span><span class="sentence" id="196">break] September 1, 1998
QUESTION:  — continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Wallace Witkowski, tape one, side B. Mr. Witkowski, could you continue to talk about your professional career? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You were in <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> , and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  I spent three years in <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> and like people who come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> get Potomac fever, I too had a very difficult time leaving the Micronesian experience behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I think it was a turning point for me in the sense that I saw a very simple society, with very simple needs, very simple ambitions, that — whose members appeared to be very happy and very content. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We did corrupt them a little bit with the ease of agricultural surplus commodities, availability. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Using our standards applied to the island star — standards, most of these people were below the level of poverty, but they lived off of subsistence agriculture, and they didn’t know how little they had until the Americans told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">That was a turning point 1n the sense that I admitted to myself and discovered that I no longer need to try to be any more American than I became, and I can be just simply myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Well, how were you trying t — previously to be more American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  It’s very hard to articulate, but any person born abroad, coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , tries very hard to become Americanized, at least it’s a typical, let’s say, pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean, there will be staunch individualists who will refuse to become American, they will September 1, 1998 be French or they will be German, or they will be this and that, for reasons of either because they think that their ethnic background or cultural background is superior to the American — many, many foreigners come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with a rather superior feeling about their own culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It’s a defense mechanism of sort, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Here, I was trying to absorb American values, American customs, American tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I wanted my children to be American, after all, they are my roots in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I simply wanted to be able to live in this society and function in this society the best I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Returning from <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> made me aware that I don’t have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , or — for example, when I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don’t care about the antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I spent two or three years battling a — a ca — in — in — fighting in a case in which the law was changed after — after a couple years and I felt the — like standing on a shifting sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I realized also that I’m not happy not dealing with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So then I switched in my career to consumer protection, because the Federal Trade Commission has two main functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The antitrust — enforcement of the antitrust laws, which it shares with the justice department, and the consumer protection fo — mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I felt much more comfortable in the <span class="REGION">consumer protection area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And in fact, I continued from a year or September 1, 1998 two after I returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> until I retired in 1994 — four. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So that was the rest of my career in the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I — I was an enforcement attorney, and a senior attorney, thought of well, getting good reviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But I realized that I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for three years and I stayed in the government 32 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I was qualified to retire, and I was getting — I was ready to move on, and in the meantime, personal crises, my second marriage failed also. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I started worrying about myself, who am I and what am I doing with my life and what’s going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I started examining my life probably around the age of 50, not before. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">By that time I was a father of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I was bravely putting them through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and supporting them and giving the older children educations. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Thank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the — the last two daughters went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I went into therapy, first of all, because I really got scared when my second marriage failed and I felt unhappy and I felt alienated and I felt a failure. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And so, started my spiritual journey with reading such semi-spiritual but still thought provoking books September 1, 1998 as memoirs of Carl Jung, “Memories, Dreams, Reflections,” or even M — what’s his name, ems — George Peck or Scott Peck?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Scott Peck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Scott Peck, “The Road Less Traveled.” </span><span class="sentence" id="233">One of the unfortunate developments caused by the age that I — I forget names, <span class="NPIP">places</span> , things. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We call it senior moments, but I’m sure you’ve heard that name before — that term before. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Peck was an influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to — to what do I believe in and where am I going and what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both individual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I spoke about the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> were killed or murdered wa — together with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn’t do anything while some people were brutalized by other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I personally cowered when — when a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand told me to do things, and I had to obey him. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Open up my briefcase, show him what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That was, by the September 1, 1998 way, a briefcase in which I carried music. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I was, at that time trying to study piano a little bit, didn’t last very long, but I was stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and violated. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private practice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than — than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Although I am not complaining, I was — I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is — totally satisfies me. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Spiritually, I went through a sort of a — I don’t know how to describe it, awakening. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be responding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Although by the presets of my <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Now, you were Catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Catholics are very good on guilt and — and sin and sacrifice. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I’m saying it somewhat sarcastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I discovered a teaching, which is called a Course in Miracles, about 10 years ago, and I read the introduction and I said to myself, these September 1, 1998 are the words that I have always searched for, and these are the words that are saying what I have been craving to hear and to — to learn, to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And started studying it, and I reached the point that the teaching was so powerful and so persuasive and so deep, that I started — I felt the need to share it with two closest beings to me, my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">At that time my father had died, died a fulfilled man, because he managed to bring his family together, managed to give me and my sister education in spite of the horrible ordeals of World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So I started translating some things into Polish that really moved me, really reached me. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">In the course of subsequent years, it —

<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  — to — to study it in the Polish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">September 1, 1998
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  I then discovered that there are other people who seriously want to translate the text of this teaching into Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">There were already at that time going on, translations into a number of other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And to make the long story short, through a process of submitting samples of translations and reviewing them and commenting on them, the Foundation for Inner Peace, which 1s a publisher of the course, chose a young man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , young man from my point of view, relatively speaking, the man in his 40’s, and — as a translator and me as an editor of his translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We essentially were translating and making sure that the trans — the substance of each sentence, each paragraph and chapter is — is correctly rendered in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And we just completed the task of translating 1200 pages of a very, very deep metaphysical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And Friday I will be in the state of New York in — ina teaching foundation, where we will be talking about the publication of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So that was my great, great project of translating, of course, volunteering, and what happened is — and I’m rambling, even though I thought that I would be doing more legal work of some sort after I gra — after I graduate — after I retire from the government, I discovered that practice of law 1s so bureaucratically impeded by various bar associations and I need to join and I need to | — be licensed that — that I na — just naturally evolved that I am a translator today. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">In the meantime, I picked up September 1, 1998 other pe-people and other projects that I acted as a translator or an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">There was a period when the American labor movement was deeply interested in the evolution of the independent labor movement in communist <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the solidarity movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And when the first representatives came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I was asked by UAW, United Auto Workers to be their translator and escort interpreter and I traveled with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I also attended a number of their constitutional conventions, whenever they have a delegate from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to escort him and translate for him, and also what he says to the convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And then, also came volunteer work for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That had deeper roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I sought this work out myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I felt —

QUESTION:  Had the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened when you sought [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yes, oh even when the first efforts at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> — at the organiza — or- organizing the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> took place, I was, as you can tell from the interview in 1990 — first of all, I donated a number of books and pamphlets and materials to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , because when I was handling the American claims for property lost in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , when I was working for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and when I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I managed to reach the people, the survivors who September 1, 1998 are running the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Historical Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And I obtained from them a number of unique publications, such as witness accounts of liquidation of ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> or of some other — Bialystok, rather obscure publications, of which there weren’t very many, you know, issues available. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You couldn’t find it in a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But I brought all of these things with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And when the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened, I thought I would donate all of these things to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and that’s how my cooperation with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I turned over all of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There weren’t very many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pamphlets, but they are today in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And then I think you then come in and you have read my interview in 1990, so you know where I felt that I needed to testify as a witness to what I knew from a unique perspective of being this boy scout troop leader who had a boy in my troop who told me the story about his brother being lost and then militia taking him, communist militia taking him to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which the Jewish survivors lived and saying to the little boy, 1t — is — were you kept here? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And the kid said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That’s — that’s the version that I received from my — from my member of my troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I felt duty bound to give testimony to the truth as I know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So that’s how the interview came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then I realized that I can be of help in the oral department. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I no longer remember — but I know that I submitted my offer to — to translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">That was lost somewhere and somebody — on somebody’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> for a year, then I — September 1, 1998 nothing was done about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">One day I enquired, aren’t you interested in somebody who knows both languages and can translate? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Yes, yes, submit an application. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Well, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I don’t know what happened to — finally I — I was put in touch with the oral history department and was asked to help them in translating more significant key testimony of witnesses who were testifying in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And over the last two, three years, I lose track of it because these were long translations, long projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I worked on the Mordowicz translation, which is an incredible story of a man who twice escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and lived to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And another long and dramatic testimony of a woman who n — was one of the early inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> , Ozhrenczim(ph) Druzhinikov(ph), and also lived — and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was a very wrenching job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a type of work that I could work on, and then I had to go away from it for days sometimes, sometimes a couple weeks before I could return to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was just too devastating to relive with this person, what she had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I’m delaying giving you the name because I — I have a mental br — block right now, and I cannot remember her name, but of course, Amy Rubin knows because these are la — my two primary claims to fame as a translator, a volunteer translator for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Why, the most difficult September 1, 1998 question to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Because you see, more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something, because then I was not able to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And secondly, on a deeper level, it is my feeling that in some way I am engaged in some act of expiation or — or contrition on behalf of my countrymen, for things that they did, or failed to do when they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Now, I do not minimize the mutual accusations between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles against each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Anti-Semitism certainly was and is alive, unfortunately, which is a curious phenomenon because there are no more Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and yet, something in — something has caught both groups in — in — in this vicious circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Now there is a controversy about Poles putting up Christian crosses in — in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in which both Poles and Jews died, and Jewish tradition, of course, requires that nothing be done there [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And — and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So I — somehow I — I just feel that whatever I can do to just assist the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in its mission, I’Il do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And even though I am now in the process of moving to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> and I will be spending most of my time in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , I will be connected by modern technology with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and Amy Rubin knows that any time she needs something from me, she can do it just like she did here. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Give me the video of the interview of a witness in September 1, 1998 Polish, give me a transcript, and I will sit down and I'll translate it and give it back to her, as long as ’'ll — my mind 1s still working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  And you said you want to help the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> carry out their mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">What do you see as the mission of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Well, it’s been asked of me a — a number of times previously, including some video interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">This ties in very deeply with my spiritual values. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I think — think that not only the mission of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a — from us, we — we are not going to find our way back to our creator. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I am a firm believer in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> as — as possibly indirectly contributing. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I am extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and — and — and — and energy with which the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca — Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be September 1, 1998 they Armenians or — or just because some <span class="REGION">county</span> is in <span class="REGION">Asia</span> , that should not matter less than a mil — million people were killed because they were Asian rather than they were other group, religious or ethnic. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So I guess this is the best I can articulate at this point, why I committed to — to — to work for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  I only have concern that a lot of what I said is not going to be of — really of — of — well, maybe it will be of peripheral value, peripheral value to you to — to — to see what kind of people volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But I think the — that — that I volunteer for a slightly different reason than let’s say a —a typical, if I may use that word, survivor volunteer works for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There is a deep, tragic, desperate effort to make sure that the people who died, didn’t die in vain, without any — any lessons to be learned from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So I can — I respect my — I —- I— I — I am 1n awe of these people who come and travel a long distance sometimes, to spend a couple hours in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , just being escorts, or — or guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">My commitment is the same and yet somewhat different, because even though all the men in my family died as a result of the war, except my father, who survived the war, but I had uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">One, a pilot who died in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , another persecuted and — and killed by the communists, I feel that I have the need to assist in preserving the story of the Holocaust and teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">In one of the interviews I said six million or seven million died, and they’re silenced, so September 1, 1998 somebody has to speak in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Even if I am just translating little pieces of the — of the story, I— I hope that I am making a contribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And I’m waiting for them to give me more while my brain is still functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">After all, I am 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  So you’re planning to continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Definitely, if — 1f they just don’t mind sending the stuff to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , to <span class="REGION">rural Michigan</span> rather than calling me to come in, or sending it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Anything else, before we stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  No, I cannot think of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The difficult part of it 1s that even though that interview in 1990 was a two videocassettes long, I can still not — I still cannot make myself look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Like I probably will not be able to listen to this interview that you’re conducting with me today. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It is helping me in a sense that somehow I unburden myself, that I — that I lessen the weight of memory by talking about it, but I don’t want to review it. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">No, I cannot think of anything else that I would like to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Well, thank you very much for your contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  My pleasure, in a new sense of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Conclusion of Interview </span>
