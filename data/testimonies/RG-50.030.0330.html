<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , the real <span class="REGION">countryside</span> in a small <span class="REGION">island</span> and my father was my teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">It was a certain circle where the people thought the state should mix in as little as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">The state should have nothing to do with religion, therefore they had their own <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , built their own <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and had their own priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Also, they made their own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my father was chosen as the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We were not allowed say , as people usually do. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was two fine words. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">About 75 children went to my father and only nine children when to the official <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Your father was a teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He started being a teacher of the first <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That's different from a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The first <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were usually young people come to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But when they had no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at this free <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they asked my father to take it over and he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  How many children were there in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father's first wife died when she had borne three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And my mother had nine children, and when we were 12 years old we had to go out to work, to work for the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That meant in a way, even if my father would protest, that our childhood was taken from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">To go in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and here other children of our age were playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That was awful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Why did you have to go to work at 12?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Because we were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My mother said sometimes to my father who was educated and a school teacher, that he should leave this free <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he could earn double. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But he was an idealist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  What were the strong ideals that he believed in beyond the state not intervening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  It was only that people should choose their own priest, choose their own teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That was a personal question. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That is called in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the famous poet ,
QUESTION:  You went to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> when you were twelve, then how long did you continue to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  From 12 to 18, and then people told my father that this intelligent boy, that's what they called me, he ought to be a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">That is the place they always used for studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I never thought of being a priest, but I would like to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was impossible when I worked on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But then I worked for a community making ditches and they would stop when it suited me and go to the only person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who could teach me foreign languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That was the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There I learned English and German so much that I could start in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That was the nearest <span class="NPIP">place</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They laughed at little old me and said that my pronunciation was rather different than what they used there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And you went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> at what age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Eighteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I was 22, I could not get into the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We had to take something called before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, I went four years to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I went to to study, and what interested me is what I would call the history and ideology something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I wanted to study literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What interested me was the ideology in different times. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The development of the human spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So, I started with something called comparing literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Comparing all the different cantors literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then I was in love with a young lady and all told me that this would not give me an earning. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Only if you should be a professor and that would be two <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, I started to study as other people two literatures and that was German and Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I finished that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My first book was comparison between and who are completely different ideas but who psychologically are very alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They don't like the people as they are. , </span><span class="sentence" id="54">you would say that it was first an ape then it was a mensch, and then the next step must be an mensch. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And in the same way but his mensch was the real Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  In your studies and in your growing up, did you know any Jews, or did you know anything about the Jewish religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  We had as much bible history as Danish history, so of course we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We learned that the Jews were the chosen people, and they the Danish could only be number two. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There were no Jews in ;
QUESTION:  When did you meet Jews for the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  When I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and was a leftist in the students assembly of leftists. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">was the leading figure and later came a problem that Hitler took the power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so many Jews came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and communists and social democrats and I was very anti-Nazism and asked what can I do and they told me that great problem was that nobody knew what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Whether Hitler really had all the people behind him or the secret groups worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I said I'm willing to go as a for -- it was his best Trotsky, there's a certain history because we have Trotsky to speak here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> in '32.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Had you been to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  When was your first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Oh, my when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the vacations I always went -- rode on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My first trip was around <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then I went on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and I had to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I slept in . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There I have memories in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> when I wrote my name Jakobsen some guy said Jackobsen and I found that I would fail in my duty to the Jews if I told them I am no Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">In <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> there were many Jakobsen who were not Jewish so I let them believe I was a Jew instead of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Did they treat you badly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  They were about to throw me out, the leader of that thought he could not throw me out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  When did you begin these vacation travels to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">What years are we talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  I work from when I was 12 until I was 18 and I was born in '06, so it must have been in '25. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And in '25 there was still so much unrest and little bureaucracy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so I was told that it would be too dangerous to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and therefore I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> the next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Did you only spend vacations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or did you ever study in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I had not studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , only vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But I studied German and if I choose between taking English and Danish and German and Danish I preferred the Danish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">People like .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  The German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I think I can more than 100 verses by heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a bit more about the experiences with Trotsky and then going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to find out what's going on there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  The difference between Stalin and Trotsky must be the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Stalinism says you can build socialism in one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And Trotsky said if you do that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> will be surrounded by enemies and there would be so many enemies our socialism within that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and therefore it would be a dictatorship and he learned permanent revolution and that means not as some people believe that yes there will always be a revolution but that if there was not a revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or in other more progressive states then the revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> would fade. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Also, according to Marxism the revolution should come in the most industrial states and areas, not in a state like <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And it failed in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Different from what people believe I could see this plan had not led to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is much backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Q. Did you meet Trotsky? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Did Trotsky come to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  We had a great meeting made by the social democratic students of Trotsky, and I heard him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He spoke German and his German was not as good as I believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The day afterwards I went to see him and there I was forced away by his .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  The people close to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They were so afraid that he should be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">At that time I thought it was exaggerated, but a couple years later he was killed in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But I felt so much for Trotsky that I visited his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in , but that was when he was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  The trip that you took to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to find out what was going on, occurred in what year and what did you see in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">What did you report back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  That those groups, there were so many different groups Trotsky and Stalin and social democratic, there were really very few people, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> they told me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and meet him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They were very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He had really a dominant position, and also many people who had been socialist were now in favor of national socialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Did you see or were you aware of what Hitler was doing as far as the Jews were concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  No, there were no Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  In the 1930s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I went to political groups, and the political groups found that it only endangered their position if they had Jews in leading positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Some of the people who sent me had been leading, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> they told me that all the Jews were dropped in their leading positions because of the Hitlerism that told that the Jews dominated the Germans through their Marxist organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  So, therefore when you went to access the political conditions of the left of the social democrats and the Trotskyots, you didn't meet Jews because they had been removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Were you aware of the general conditions of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  I met Jews in because I had married a German Jewish refugee but she was unpolitical but she had friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> , of course not Jews, but also met them privately. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But they were very cautious of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  When did you meet your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  My wife came here as . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">| think you know what it means, but I think I have to explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The British had <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as and they would not allow Jews to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> if they had not learned something agricultural. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The Jews are not very agricultural but she chose to learn poultry farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to learn poultry farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And one day when one of my Jewish friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> proposed that we should make a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and meet one of his Jewish friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> who was working poultry farming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I like to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and that could only happen if we also married. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Also the Danish government did not want to take all the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , but when we married there was no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The family is still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they change the name Goldstein, because anybody can hear that it's Jewish to Gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, they found it better to hide that they are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They call themselves Gotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So they went back after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  They didn't leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  They were hidden?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They were half Jews and the half Jews were soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They had been fighting the Russians in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In the start Hitler took half Jews in his army but when they have success he thought he did not need half Jews and then they were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He had hoped that when he fought in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> he would be acknowledged as a real German, but he was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  How many trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did you make in the 1930s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  I can't tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Were there many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Because I do not make distinction between those before Hitler and after Hitler and meeting the family and political trips.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Was her family becoming more and more afraid as the years progressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  In the end they also preferred to immigrate and came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Her family did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Only one brother was left and that was because he had been a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He could stay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Let me ask you about your deep interest in German literature and German ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  It is not deep interest in German literature and German ideas, it is a deep interest in literature and ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But it 1s correct in that way that once I had to decide where I would choose English and Danish as my <span class="DLF">fields</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> or German and Danish and I chose German, and that was because I preferred to Dickensian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Why did you prefer and ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Because I thought that ideologies, how the people have thought so different movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">There was much more of this sort in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It is quoted
QUESTION:  When you talk about movements can you describe a little more what you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, the first through the <span class="BUILDING">office catholic church</span> , catholic means they said no <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Can you describe a little more about the ideas of - and that so much interested you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  is not so much his own ideas as his formulations and they met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> but is a great poet in that way that he can formulate things and Shuller's ideas that is old ideas about thought, the unreal things, the immaterial things, the unreal things that are very far from people today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Did Shillar thought affect your moral judgments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  I think I would be moral before I knew Shillar. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I like Shillar it his pathos. , </span><span class="sentence" id="164">that is Shillar and that is the same as the Christian that if you will not risk your life you will lose it, but if you risk your life you will keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  As you made your trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 1930s did you sense that war was coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Oh, it was a usual idea among the people against Hitler that it would mean war and it was really clear it would mean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">One of the reasons that Hitler could take power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> felt that it had been badly treated after the last war in 1918, and they spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The and they would have back what they had lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I think where people knew German, I know this fairly well because I was a delegate to the Council in Europe in and they really speak German but they are not German speaking and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had also taken part of old Danish part of . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Hitler would restore the old strong German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  So you felt the war coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">You felt almost the inevitability of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  How did this affect your career your thinking about what you would do with your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  In April 1940 I had to make a great decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">In April 1940 my first book came out and that was a comparison between and whose ideas are very different but whose psychs are very much alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It was accepted very good and I was told that that was the beginning of a university career. </span><span class="sentence" id="178"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> also I learned that that can't be no great difference between what you say and write and what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And it would be against my own philosophy if I would sit quietly studying philosophy when what I love was and what I hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Therefore my philosopher would tell me that now it was time to go out and take a knife if necessary and I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  How did you start to resist? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  The first thing was that the political parties who made this agreement and told us to do nothing I thought that was only --
QUESTION:  Let me ask a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Where were you when the invasion took place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  I was sleeping in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and then I said I heard so much flying and I said to my wife do you think they are British or do you think they are German. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Whenever I said that if it was not because I was sure they were Danish, but then we heard so much noise in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , people talking and we came to the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and we heard that they were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And we heard that some Germans were landing in and I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and out I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Then also I knew at once that it would change my life completely and I could hope I could return to my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That is what I wanted since I was a boy but had to watch the cattle in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">That 1s what I felt was a sacrifice ending my studies and going into politics.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  What did they want you to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  First of all I had a of names and I got them from people, members of parliament and people with whom I had studied and who were now teachers at <span class="BUILDING">gymnasiums</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I had first a meeting with one person who taught with him about what would you do and then we agreed that he should find more persons and I should find five persons who differed so I covered this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  What did you tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">What was the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  It was different at each time, each month. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">What was happening, what the Germans demanded and who made resistance, who had many no resistance of the politicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">When I talked about this then I some times met people who thought it was not enough to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We should also do something and told about several and I thought it was a good thing to support local sabotages as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did you help make sabotage possible?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  I could tell what ought to be sabotaged and once I felt I had to see it myself and I went . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">That was not a very good exercise, and I rode down the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> when the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But I felt that when you asked people to be sabotage, you ought to see the ones that are sabotaged, but I was told you should not do that anymore because it would not be good if I was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Your opposition was to the Germans and to the Danes, the Danes who had made the agreement with the Germans to become collaborators?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  The government chose to make no resistance and in that way could count economically better. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">If you open a war the who fought with the Germans had no sympathy for the Nazis of the Germans, not at all, but thought that we spoiled their policy and the difference was not that both our wanted the best for our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The difference was what we considered to be the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They thought that it couldn't be with so little sacrifices economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We thought that we should not be ashamed afterwards was the most important thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  We did not fight the Nazism because of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">That was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Many things we didn't like of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was democracy and dictatorship and we heard that the Jews would be captured, taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We must do all that we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Can you describe that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Did you expect it to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  It was a part of Nazism and we had wondered that it did not happen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But the first thing was that they shall not be taken in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and the next thing was to find <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boats</span> to bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  How did you find the Jews to tell them to go into hiding?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Was this operation to save the Jews to rescue them and to hid them and then to send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , was this one of the largest efforts that was made before 1944? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Was this a major effort on the part of the resistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  The meaning of resistance was that the Allies should win and we should be one of the Allies and Germans should lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The other thing was a thing of sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That has nothing to do with the end of the war, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The to win the war was not diminished by news. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">That was a humanitarian thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">In <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> we have a distinction where some of our friends were Jews and who were not.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Did that make them doubly vulnerable because they were Jews and leftists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  All those who had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Nazism</span> all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  How did the rescue, the hiding of the Jews actually take place? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Were there doctors who hid the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Whom did you turn to. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Whom was the network?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  There were all sort of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It is true that the doctors in one <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because they were my friends and I told them about it and mainly Jews who were told not to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were sent to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and people believed that they were ill, and they stayed there until was there and somebody came and took them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">First was a Doctor -- this would be a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where I corroborated before, and he had played a very great part in helping.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  About Christmas '42 I knew that now we have come so far that there were four organizations that covered the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Two political parties, the communist party and the party and then which was people from all parties, but I knew they were dominated by government, which was not dominated by the communist, we had nothing against the communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And the I felt 1t would be very important if we could make a common organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We could prevent shoulders from the different organizations and the men who I had to go was . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He was a member of the communist party and he was the leading figure in . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I had to talk with him and we agreed that either no should political parties be in this organization or this should be the both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">That is something that I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">In the beginning we said, Anna Shotts, who was the leader of the party would not be a member because his . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">People knew him and we were not as well know. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But when we came to Christmas he was in . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Then we was eager to remember himself that we accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  What was your life like during this period? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I assume that the government was not happy with the activities that you were engaged in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  The government told us that it would be great unhappiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We felt that the great danger was that when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> lost the war, which we hoped then we would be considered as the people who helped Nazism. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Usually when three people are fighting for the freedom on Europe, it also means the freedom of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , it would not be acceptable to sit and doing nothing when our people were losing their lives to win for our freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Did you have to move around a great deal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Already in the first summer in '40, and it came so that we were told that the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> would be <span class="REGION">central Germany</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">military offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they came to me and asked me if I could find <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , and I had a list of 5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  You were saying that you found 5,000 <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  For the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">military offices</span> , but I could use it freely and I was realistic enough to take some of the best for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But I never spent more than a week at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">If I observed the first time that there were some Nazis in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , then I left at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But even if there were no signs of that, I never remained in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> more than one week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  Did you wear different disguises? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Did you change your appearance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">At that time there were very few people yet and I thought that wearing a beard was almost to tell you that you were working underground, so I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But I had a very big hair, completely straight and short. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And you expect this which was only usual -- I had no reason.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What happened to your wife during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  When the Jews were persecuted, she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> like the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">She got work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> as a photographer, what she had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">She had worked 1n the famous <span class="BUILDING">House</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> founded by . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And she got work in the same sort here and even she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and her sister also and her sisters become Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">She is a sculpture. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She did youth work. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She has become Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They didn't come back.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  She went in a great <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , not with a fisherman, a great <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from and I drove her myself and that she should be hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I remember very well when I came there and a man should be standing at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he would show me which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to bring her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Were there other Jews on that same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Not that I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  When did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Was this in October? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Was this right when the roundup was taking place, when it began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  It was when they started to tell that half Jews, because she was a half-Jews would not be taken, and Jews married to a Dane, would not be taken, so in that way she should be secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But we did not believe the Nazis and it also came so. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She would have been taken had she remained here. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">There were two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It was much as you would be taken as hostage from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The Germans had sought me already for more than a year and they took hostages, and I could not let her sit as a hostage and I could not go to the Germans to get her free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  What was she doing when you were living underground, when you were moving <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> all those years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  She had her work and that was as a photographer in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  How did you keep in touch with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  In other <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we would meet our friends, but we did not see eachother so much and therefore when it was for her it was no problem to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  What was the relationship of the Danish police and the resistance movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  The Danish police is not one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They had different attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">The Danish police of course had to obey the Danish government, that's the usual attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But as the military people in the summer of '44 came to us and said they would acknowledge us as the underground government and obey us. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The resistance was very much against it and in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> later they could . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The police were, in my opinion, more loyal to the freedom council than the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  So you felt that you could rely upon them, you could work with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But their job was more, not the actual sabotage, but if it should end in a real fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was divided into six <span class="REGION">regions</span> and the military man had the command in each of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That was for fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We believe a long time that the British would go ashore in . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It came in another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We didn't know that and as late as the 2nd of May we were not sure who would come first, the Latvians, or the rest of the powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The Latvians were at . [</span><span class="sentence" id="351">have the impression that even many communists would prefer that the western powers would come first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  So, then the resistance prepared many different eventualities, one was, as I understand, one was the military engagement when the invasion came. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">What about sabotage? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Was that a different part of what the resistance did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Sabotage was the main thing all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We start with information but when I came out of those people and told them about this information and asked them to make local newspapers, somebody wanted to do something more. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And we talked about sabotage and some were ready for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Later we made what we called the military force. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">That was when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was about to lose if there should be fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Sabotage came very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There had been sabotage in May 14, and the Germans came in April 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But in the beginning it was very often only some boys, some very good boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Later there were two big sabotage organizations, which was organized by the communist and , which was organized by the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">At one time the people came to me and said that they had been organized by , but he made it his policy and not -- he was more interested that it would support him when freedom came that it would be and they would prefer to be under me. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He was very bitter against me because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I, of course, was very glad. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">That was the largest, most effective was the largest sabotage organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Did you influence the choices for sabotage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  How did you decide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  First we had to know and that was through the ministers where many of my friends were. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">What the Germans were doing there and there, what was important, who sent their wares to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I could always -- I had some people who were working all the time and ministers who knew everything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They could tell us what was important to sabotage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a late thing, but very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was not just delivering wares to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was when Hitler needed troops more on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Then they went through and it was important to make sabotage in the start some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were blown up but then also some innocent people were killed, and we forbid that and made only railway sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So, the railways when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came and had stopped troops for a couple weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Sometimes it was

<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  At one time, and this is a very great thing, one time we knew that the Germans would take the complete Danish fleet and the high marine officer did sink them. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That was for only people who knew about it, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They were sunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">That was a very important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That was at ,

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  We would have done the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We did not make that distinction, but we were certain if we had been told that the Danish teachers would be taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> then we had done something for the Danish teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  The Danish Jews were welcomed back into <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">There never had really been anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , only in this small net of socialist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">In the Danish parliament there were 150 members and three of them belonged to the national socialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Only once did they get anybody elected during the German occupation but it was 150. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It never was a big party.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Why is <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> different from other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> in regard to anti-semitism and what happened during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  I don't think we are different from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Not at all, and I do not know the relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The Jews helped the in a difficult position many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They were not allowed to have <span class="REGION">land</span> , so they couldn't be farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They were not allowed in the guilds, so they had to be merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They could lend money. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So, many people became very angry at the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  But not in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Also in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Less perhaps because there were fewer, but it has in the middle ages something to do with history that the Jews killed Jesus, and that is not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They didn't kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">When the Jews killed people they stoned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">When the Romans killed people they had different methods, but one was crucification. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">In that way you can see it was not the Jews, but the Romans who killed Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Jesus, was after all, a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  There 1s some thinking now that the Germans looked the other way when the Jews were being rescued. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They didn't arrest the Jews when they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Do you feel the Germans eased the way for the Jews to escape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  I don't think it has any importance, but of course there were German soldiers who were against persecution of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Like there were German soldiers who were not national socialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But we did not feel anything of that therefore we had to hide the Jews as the first step.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  And you didn't feel that the Germans made it a little bit easier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I'm sure there were many German soldiers who were against Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  There's another part of the reconsideration of the rescue, and that is the Danish some of them asked to be paid a great deal of money to take the Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Do you feel that was a big factor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rescue boats</span> and many lost their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and fishermen with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> 1s 1n a difficult <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Of course they took money for the risk, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I have not found that they behaved badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Did you help to raise money or dispense the money for these fishermen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  The Jews paid themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The Jews never a politariat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> many times during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  No, only one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to help <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> acknowledge as Allies, also by Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We did not know who would be first at our friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The Russians were very quickly forged through all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and even the Navy could not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The Danish government had joined the anti-communist pact with <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> so we were afraid whether the Russians would consider us helping the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Therefore I proposed in the freedom council that we should take up the relationship with the Soviet Union, which <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had broken itself and sent back the ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I proposed who was a friend of mine a little family man and they agreed and so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> as a fisherman and went through the <span class="BUILDING">British Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The <span class="BUILDING">Russian Embassy</span> did not know me, the British did, and they told the Russians I was good enough and the Latvians would accept a representative for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , not simply <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Then I told them we would send an ambassador who was not very political or we could send a man who had not been an ambassador but who had played a role in the resistance movement and the could prefer whom they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They preferred a man who had been in the resistance movement and he was sent <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  What was the policy of the freedom council to collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">How did you feel <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> should treat the collaborators?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  The Danish freedom council had made a great complex of laws, who regulates, he was of an organization of all lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He had made that and the political parties also made it and when we compared they were not so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">There was a question of death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We were all against death sentence and it was not <span class="NPIP">within</span> but before we agreed we also had politicians and what these politicians did and I had to go around all <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and show it to resistance people. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">When they heard that there was no death sentence then they said I think we must kill that person before that law is made. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I am sure that more people had been killed if I had not returned and told them we have this sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">As a consequence of judgments and not what we call the the long knives night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  What was that long knives night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  That was when people killed the people who helped the Germans, especially what we called , In English, informers. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">If we had not had this sentence many informers had been killed by the resistance people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  How many collaborators were sentenced to death?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  I think about 90 were sentenced to death and about half of them were executed because in the summer of '45 it was necessary if people should not do it themselves without judgment but already in the autumn of '45 it was not like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">As a matter of fact we were against death sentences and nobody was killed after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  Why were you against that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  If people are imprisoned they can be . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">If people have been executed, you cannot give them life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That's a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But I'm sure we're all against death sentence in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">There is no -- 1t was only in this law against , 1t 1s not been outlawed in other sorts of criminality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Were there an unusually large number of collaborators, that 1s people who joined the German army or fought with the Germans on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  I cannot compare relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was very few compared with the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  The king has received an enormous amount of credit for the story about wearing the yellow star in order to befriend the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Do you know where that story came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  No, and I do not know whether it is true or it is untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  If you're not sure about whether the king wore the star or didn't wear the star, what do you think happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  The king was very popular and he was much against the German occupation, and it was a great help to many people when he rode through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> completely unprotected, and I believe that this star that is a myth sprung out of this popularity which really deserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  After the war, the knowledge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> became wide spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">When did you first learn about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Long before the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Haven't I told that I had a career already in '33 through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a career from 40 German refugees here, communists, Trotskys, social democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And there of course I heard everything they knew in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That was in the summer of '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I had that relationship all the time and I heard that somebody had disappeared in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> and never seen anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">How we lived there you couldn't know anything about that, but they disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  And disappeared into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  We did not know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I'm sure it was something like that because people disappeared completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They could sit and know them there and one day they're away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Did you have knowledge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> before the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  I did not make the distinctions. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We knew that many of our friends disappeared from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and how it became, only that they disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  So when the Jews were rescued in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> there was no sense that you were saving them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> but just from capture by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  We sort of saved them and found some things, that was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">What that would be we couldn't know better than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Were there women who were leaders of the resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But we were all in the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The resistance means many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">There are sabotages and there are what we call the illegal army, illegal newspapers and I'm sure many women worked in the newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  And in hiding people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  We had lived in the underground for several years and when I had lived in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> one week, I left 1t because somebody might have seen me too many times there and they very, very often knew we went and did could tell us a good <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  As I understand it, there were some disagreements in the freedom council between the parties on the right and on the left between Helga and the social democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Did these ever affect the rescue of the Jews, these differences, or was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  I can't answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">There was no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In the freedom council we never thought of who was a social democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">There were two parties, the communist and the and we were unpolitical. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I knew the Jews because I was a social democrat but we never spoke of such things.

<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  This is about your . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Can you say something about your love for birds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  It is not a special love for birds, it is love of nature, but there are very few memories in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and the insects are small but after all I have a collection of insects, but the main thing are the birds in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">There is much listening of birds and knowing their voices as recognizing them and seeing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">This is from the council in Europe at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> is one of the main figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">When the European movements started I went to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and was a Danish member of the first European movement and what we demanded was a council for Europe that came later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">My father was really against it and he called it the Church Party and aptly warned against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">As I often did my own things during the war, I went there and later were very eager to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">This is a picture of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He is much older of course, but more than usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He was born in 1854 and he remembered the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in '64 when he was 10 years old when we lost a certain part of . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">He belonged to those people who found that the state should not play too great a role in people and families should decide for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He was against what we call ; the <span class="BUILDING">people's church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Even the words, he called it and he was also against people going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">People should choose whom they wanted to teach their children so it's a circle of people in my <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where I had born had him as the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">At one time there were 65 children going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">unofficial school</span> and only nine going in the official <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">No person has had more importance for me than he and I think it's a very good thing when a son can say about his father that no person has meant more to him particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
