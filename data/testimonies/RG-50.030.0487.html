<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None</p>
<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> This is tape number one, side A. Just for the record, would you tell me your name, where you live now, and when and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is John Meyerstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they give me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I’m not sure how, and it’s -- from that moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I currently live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oakville</span> , <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> , which is about 20 miles west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , on the 21*' of March, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Tell me, do you have many memories of those first years in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Truthfully I have to say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I know that some people say that they can remember everything when they were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pram</span> , or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cradle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Tell me about your parents, their names, and where they were from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosslau</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in -- on March the 10", 1893. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutentag</span> , in Upper Silesia, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> , Germany, on the 29" of June, 1910.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  And do you know wh-where they met, and how -- how they came to be married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  How they met I don’t know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Both my families -- both my parent’s families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that it was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My mother never discussed it, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn’t discuss with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But how they actually met, and -- I don’t know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage, but how that was done, if -- if my assessment 1s correct, I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  And your father served in World War I, I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother, who also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but who did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day, and was listed as missing 1n action, and never -- never found again, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So there were three brothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - ’18, and only two came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  You know what -- what kind of service your father performed, or where he was --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My -- I -- I -- I think my father’s younger brother was in an infantry regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father and his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father’s younger brother, the one who was killed in 1914 - ’18, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My father and his elder brother Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and Is -- I don’t know how far the cavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became extinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My father’s elder brother Hugo came out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second leftenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Do you know where he served, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  -- did he see combat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I believe it was always on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> , because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had been elsewhere on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I have my father’s military b-book, you know, of the class of -- of 19 f -- I can’t think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But it doesn’t show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record book, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But I’ve also since, in the last -- since my father’s death, found my grandfather’s military book, and he was in the class of 1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So, on my father’s side of the family, military activity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I do recall that my father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses, and gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding, and my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The other thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father, on one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that when he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this unit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, “Well, Meyerstein, you can’t say that there are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn’t be here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So again, I find it sometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took- actually took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who didn’t view this in any shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Whether that’s normal, I can’t say actually, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father’s brother, 1s after World War I, when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, ““Why don’t you come back into the German army?” </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And he said, “Well, you know, I’m Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And - and apparently they said to him, “Well, why don’t you just say you’re Christian, it won’t any difference,” and -- and left it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He didn’t, of course, do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What I’m getting at it’s so peculiar and so strange in what subsequently took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  What business was your father’s family in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  My father’s family had a -- what you would call a small department store in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosslau</span> <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in Rosslau. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They were the only Jewish family in this entire community. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In fact my grandmother, my f-father’s mother, was also born in this -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosslau</span> , and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and the marriage certificate to my grandfather, also 1-in -- in my files. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And apparently he was quite successful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis came to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  They were the only Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So there was no <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or community there that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">No -- not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth certificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the names are all traditional German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">M-My father is Ludwig. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My elder -- his elder brother Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af -- Hans. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My -- my grandfather was Max. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">If you look at his parent’s birth certificates, 1t’s Magnus, which 1s really like a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But this also applies to my father’s -- grandmother -- my mother’s grandparents in like manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So when people say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don’t honestly know. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it 1s 1n -- in- in German, except in German it’s a different pronunciation. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So the documents which I have finally found among my father’s papers, after a long time, so far I’ve -- I’ve sor -- deciphered that they’ve gone back to about 1822, and they’re all -- the Christian names, the first names, were all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but totally integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they probably couldn’t believe what was taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Your father’s family, you said, had a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in that time --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I would call it a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in the like manner, and I have seen pictures of it a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  And your father worked there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No, my father -- my father became a barrister and a judge, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> , where I was ultimately born, practiced criminal law. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And ironically -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> is a very big chemical loca -- area, even I think to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And 1-ironically, which I didn’t realize, he never discussed it, but my mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , whose mother is my father’s -- was my father’s sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the big German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Course, this all -- we’re not talking about that particular period, we’re talking in the -- in the 30’s and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my mother was a very well known criminal barrister 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  And he would have been there through the 20’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Ah, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  An-And then you were born there in 1934?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  735.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  °35 - ?</span><span class="sentence" id="81">35. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And what about your mother’s family, what business were they in? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">You said that they were also --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My -- my mother’s parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutentag</span> , which is an interesting name because it means good day, or good morning -- in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> , almost on the -- on the Polish border. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my grandmother, my mother’s mother, was Rosa Eisner. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They owned what you would call a farm equipment wholesale business. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I have pictures, I found pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I have no idea how they managed to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other problems which they were experiencing. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Where my grandfather had -- you could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with the telephone number, and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They did farm equipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was predominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">farm equipment</span> , I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was predominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had been for 150 years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And very successful as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So let’s start now with -- with -- your father was arrested, I understand, in -- in 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The first ti -- my fa -- my father’s sister emigrated with her husband to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And one of the -- also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , also German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And one of the German Jews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this 1s only -- I’m only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father took over some activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This was, or been public perhaps early ’38 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And for some reason or another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and take money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he was arrested and held for six weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> -- but it was obviously nowhere near anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then, I think after Kristall night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mother’s father was also arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My father’s -- my mother’s brother, Lota, was also arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And they found each other there, of all -- I mean, most incredible, found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">All three got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Now, you have to remember, my father was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother’s mother -- father was also a veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans basically said to some of these people, “Because of your activities as, you know, in World War I, we're going to let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we’ll never -- you’ Il never get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So I believe my father must have got out, probably in early 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I don’t know which day, and my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don’t know exactly when, and under what conditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then applied for visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in, I think, February of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So between Kristallnacht and entry into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we say the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Let me go back and ask you when your -- your father’s sister left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  That would have been somewhere in 1938, I go -- I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] in the same year, then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  But before Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  And it was an escape in a sense, a sense of -- of being unsafe for Jews and the decision to leave [indecipherable |</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you’re right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more from my aunt’s husband, as distinct from other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My mother has mention -- mentioned to me on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in ’38 -- when, I don’t know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">My father’s family, of which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father’s side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of said what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I’ve been given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and belongings without any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But they couldn’t come to any conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And you have to remember, from my father’s side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800’s and my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more German than the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Okay, if you want to put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Now, I don’t th -- I don’t think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mother’s side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my mother’s grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the days when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was under Russian law, and rode across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , into -- into <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn’t just a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So I suspect that they -- his parents, great-great-grandparents, sort of said you’d better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But, if you follow what I’m getting at, it’s that depth of -- of period. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But my parent, when they had the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn’t come to lo -- to a conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We’re sitting here today saying why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I can’t answer that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. [</span><span class="sentence" id="132">indecipherable] interesting to know what that conversation was like, what the arguments were [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I -- I get the impression from her mother that -- th-the -- the women on the one hand wanted to go, and the men -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even though things had already declined, I don’t know to what degree how far. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Everything which I read, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it’s true, but things still somehow, how did they manage to survive and live with no income coming in? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Because although things were tightening, you could still spend money, if you had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  And, you know, perhaps they just thought that this was just an aberration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the women wanted to go, the women were clearer --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I understand on my mother’s side, her mother, and my mother wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My father’s mother was not enthusiastic, but I don’t know that, I’m just giving you comments which my mother said to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So your father comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , do you have any memory of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I can only tell you that my mother went to pick him up, so she must have been notified. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And she had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> is not, you know, a -- a bus ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And my mother said that nothing happened to her physically, they were just, you know, they just told to go sit in a corner in the -- of the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Of the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was terribly rude, they just said go sit over there, and -- and -- and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I have to assume that it was done by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My mother said that, you know, from that day onwards, my father -- there were no -- no more argument about leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I have to conclude that -- that my father was too stunned and shattered at what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And even though he’d been four years in the first World War, I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and experienced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> had no comparison to what we read about, what took place in World War I, where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios, but he was on th -- we never discussed that, he -- he -- he could not -- he could not --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  No, or he wouldn’t talk about it, let’s put it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Well then, we’re coming close to the time when you -- you and your mother and father, and your grandfather, you mother’s father, left together to go on the [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, that’s an interesting aspect, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My grandfather, on my -- ma -- my mother’s father, had some relatives who had emigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I think it would have had to be in the very late 18 -- the latter part of the 1800’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">How they got in touch with these relatives, I really don’t know, but they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And where the exact relationship was I don’t know, because I ultimately met these people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and they were the ones who provided the sponsorship bond documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they couldn’t really explain the exact relationship as to how -- whether it was their mother, mother’s mother or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And as you know, when people went through Ellis Island, names got changed, or people married each other on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , names got changed, or people married each other on the boat, I -- I really can’t te -- I’m sorry, I really can’t tell you how that happened, other than that two of the relatives- and I have [indecipherable] gave me some of the documents, which I didn’t know</p>
<p>QUESTION:  [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I don’t -- I’ve met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Years later I met them, and they viewed me as very distant, we viewed each other as very distant cousins, but none of us could exactly explain where the connection -- the third person shown on those documents, I have no idea, other than it was obviously a very generous individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Let’s look at that, as long as we’re talking about it, because we can mention the names on tape, because I have those document here as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">This is the one you’re talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Edna Cohn, when I met her was already in her -- I -- either late 60’s or early 70’s and we’re now talking over 30 - 40 years ago, almost -- or -- or longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Edna was not married, and apparently she spent her life in -- in a stockbroking -- most of her career in a <span class="BUILDING">stockbroking office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">When we met it was in <span class="REGION">California</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , they’d retired for health or weather reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Samuel Fox was married to Edna Cohn’s sister, Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Samuel Fox was not a relative, or any connection, but he was married to Miriam, and had been a pharmacist in [indecipherable] and -- and had his own business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Aaron Stein, also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , who is the third affiant here shown in the documents, I don’t know who that is, other than obviously a very generous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They put up the money for the bonds, which enabled my parents and my grandfather, where the connection was, Ludwig Eisner to -- to put applications in, and I believe the -- the sort of certificates, the -- what do they call them, visa application numbers are the ones shown here as well, for the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">This document also shows Ludwig Eisner, which the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here didn’t know who it was, although it was -- he was listed in all the -- the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But he happened to be my grandfather, and he’s shown here actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Uh-huh, they didn’t know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  And they didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They do now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  So these three people put up the money, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  These three people, yeah --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- presumably had never met your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Didn’t even know my parents existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Didn’t know they existed until they --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  -- presumably got a letter from someone, maybe your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Not my father, would have had to be from my grandfather, because he -- Ludwig Eisner, my father’s father-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">That’s amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Yes, and I -- how that ever happened, how they got th -- th -- how they traced each other, I don’t honestly know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  And they didn’t know themselves, when I met them years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And -- and the re -- the relationship was -- was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And years later Edna Cohn and her sister Miriam Fox, visited <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and at that time -- to see my parents, and at that time my parents financially were in a position to repay --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  The bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  -- the bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I have comments -- I have letters in my -- in my father’s papers, which I found in -- in -- really in the last year or so, because where my parents -- my father died six weeks short of 93, and my mother subsequently, almost 20 years younger, died two ye -- in 2001, at 91 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So you imagine, I had almost a hundred years worth of com -- amalgamated documents to look through, that which had survived, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And I found letters which Edna Cohn [indecipherable] written to my father in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to sort of say -- they were still sending them some money, not to worry about that, so I imagine that must have depressed my father considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  But they were able to repay that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  They pa -- have repaid the bond, how much was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Pve no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  I -- in -- in terms of -- of today’s currency, I don’t know what the cost, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> probably, would know what a bond for a visa -- I mean, it was a standard, I would imagine, a standard visa bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">What it was, I don’t really know, translated into 2004 currency valuations today, I would imagine is -- might be somewhat more expensive, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But it was very generous of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And if 1t hadn’t been for them, we probably wouldn’t have been sitting here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I’m going to flip this tape over, while we’re at a breaking point here. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">This is tape one, side B. So tell me now what you know about the -- the decision to leave, and the purchase of the ticket, if you know anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I don’t know a great deal of how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I can only conclude from my mother’s comments, that the moment my father was released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and them -- and 1-in -- in similar manner, I suspect, although probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother’s fath -- my grandfather on my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They didn’t really have much choice about leaving, because that which I’ve read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told you have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We’re -- we’re -- we'll arrest you and -- and you’ll never be let out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">How they got tickets on the St. Louis, who organized that, and in what manner, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I do know that my parents -- and this is only what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though my father and my grandfather were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , something would have to be done, or immediately after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And my grandmother -- my -- on my mother’s side, came down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutentag</span> , presumably to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> , and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry, which they sewed -- from what I’m told, stitched into furnitu -- into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , cause in those days, and this is where the anomaly is so incredible is, you could take everything that you had, or you could buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So they took two complete containers, which I would be -- the equivalent of say -- I don’t know what a container in those days would be viewed. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Today, two con -- small containers would be 20 foot containers, which I gather was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fridge</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In fact, ’ve often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical appliances, that don’t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electrical appliances</span> , that don’t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Clo -- everything which they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We never got them at the end, but I mean, that -- that’s a different story, and we can get to that in due course. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">How they did that, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a dangerous thing, but they didn’t think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing open the -- the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They might check your clothing, but they wouldn’t do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were going, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Because as you know, when we left on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , I think -- I don’t know what the amount was, probably, you know, five or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don’t know, not much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So in other words, you had money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and you had nothing left at the time, so we -- we had no money on -- on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Everything had already been paid for on the St. Louis. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But how that actually happened, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">At th -- it was never explained to me, and I -- I’ve asked my -- I have some cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> from my mother’s side, and they don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They know even less than I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Do you have any memory of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Not a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I -- I gather that I was apparently -- I got lost on -- it was -- it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Perhaps the word luxury’s a bit too strong, but it was -- it was a very pleasant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It was like -- for b -- I -- a-again, and it’s not something that my parents discussed with me, but what I’ve subly read is, you know, it was used for -- people would, in better times, go on holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And apparently I -- I got lost somewhere, and that caused a great panic for my mother, and then they found me, or my grandfather found me, and with no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But that’s about the only thing I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I’ve got one or two pictures, but they really aren’t -- three or four, that you wouldn’t know it’s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , it -- a-and they’re not in groups of people, and quite frankly, I don’t -- I don’t have a big recollection on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Did your parents take those photographs? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I’m not convinced that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I think my father -- I think my father was too stunned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Stunned, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  I ga -- the pictures which I have, and there are only about two or three, I can see a cor -- wh- whe -- when -- when people were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , s -- as I understand it, you know, it was like a -- you know, it was already -- it wasn’t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> as they subsequent became, but it was already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , so everybody got shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St. Louis with my father, you can see his hair growing back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My grandfather was always bald, and so you can’t tell from those pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And of course, they’re all dressed again in -- in clothes and suits and ties and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But you can see in my father’s picture, at least I can, perhaps to me, th-the trauma of what had happened, and I’m not so sure that he took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He -- he -- for years he didn’t want to be photographed, and whether that was a reminder of the way these things happen, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Even in better times, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He wouldn’t be standing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He -- he was not the -- he was not an outward going person. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">My mother was, he was more reserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Perhaps it related to his profession, perhaps it related to his -- he was a 19" century person, having been born before the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And I -- I -- he once said to me that, you know, he -- he didn’t like the 20" century at all, which of course is understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He was much more comfortable in -- in that era. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And wit -- wi -- reflects itself in the -- the relationship which we had together. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It actually changed a little bit when we had grandchildren -- when I had grandchildren, which of course he always used to say to me he never thought he would have because he was so much older in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And he lived long enough to s -- to see my eldest daughter go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , which of course was a great thing for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So the -- the stories that you may have from the voyage, are all things that your mother --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  -- and par -- and father --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, my father discus --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No -- not your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  -- scussed not a single thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">No, we could never talk on those matters, and my mother asked me not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I tried once as a -- as a mid-teenager, and my father started to get emotionally very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And my mother came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and -- and saw what was happening, gathered what was happening, and just pulled me to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and said, don’t ask, and stop it, and I said I’m sorry, and he calmed down and that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We could talk on other matters, prior to 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Now, the -- the horrendous things didn’t really affect -- didn’t happen till somewhat later, but in looking back it’s that period which he -- obviously he could not look. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But he ca -- but as time -- as the years went by, he mellowed -- not that we could talk about these things, whereas my mother still retained the emotional problems which I suspect she experienced having to wi -- watch this in a more active role than I did, as a small boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So the -- whatever stories then are from your mother, from the [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Entirely from -- entirely answers to questions which I posed over a few -- period of few -- of a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , when we had -- and we can come to that later, but in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , where we ultimately ended up at, there again was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> per se, and there were also a few other German refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Mostly women whose husbands had -- had -- had been left behind, or couldn’t get out, and they got together -- and because my mother was -- I was a small boy, and you -- you know, the days of leaving with babysitters was unheard of, so I was always carted around, and then put in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and given a book to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I would sometimes hear some of these things which they would talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And -- and of course all these things also got played out, so it was comments as a result, and further comments, and answers to questions which my mother gave, among a group of three or four other ladies, some a little bit older, with no children, but in the same sort of situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So what -- what stories do you have of the voyage itself, that in --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , it was -- 1t was very -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbelievably, I mean, not that she said that, but when you read the background, you have to really question yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Here they are forced out of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters and everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But I think a great deal, from what I’ve read, or what I’ve heard, would indicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an extremely decent individual, and determined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there was no -- no animosity against anybody in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And I believe the -- the Israeli government honored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after the war, and I’ve also read that as a result of his activities, he was relieved of command when the St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in - to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> ultimately returned empty in -- in - to Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Never given another command, although he was a career naval officer from World War I days. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But he was left alone, which 1s always again, you do -- you’d have thought he’d have been put on trial for being decent to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That did not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So I think a lot the -- the -- the way the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> conducted themselves, probably in my -- I can only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So I think the voyage to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> probably was very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The voyage back from <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> was not so pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">My -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I -- I don’t know the name, I can’t recall the name of it, I’m sure it’s listed somewhere, there was one person who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I think, you know, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife of -- of that ba -- if -- 1f -- if my memory is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Ya -- people talked among themselves sometimes, but to what degree I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">On the voyage back, they apparently had to have committees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various committees which would -- which would sort of patrol the <span class="INT_SPACE">decks</span> , certainly during the night, or during the day and night, to avoid people from trying to commit suicide, and my father -- my mother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I don’t know what my grandfather, whether he was that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It’s just that she responded, or she mentioned that to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would perhaps do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Whether that’s right or wrong I don’t know, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I’m not aware that anybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And of course there must have been, and I suspect, although my mother didn’t mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was going to happen, because if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> really returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> again, then -- or wherever we sailed, the re -- the results would have been extremely dire.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">An-Anything else from the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, we were never in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, I know, in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  You know, in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether the passengers at the time knew what was taking place, and I -- I-I’ve got to be careful here now in how I respond to you, because I could be making comments about what I’ve read.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  My understanding is that the Jewish relief agency in -- in the s -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was trying to negotiate --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Release.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I don’t know whether -- what would have happened if people had known that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I’ve also read that one or two passengers, who had tickets, Jewish passengers, never believed these tickets were valid from the Hamburg American line, and went to the Cuban authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or whatever, and got landing visas separately, on their own, before they ever doc -- you know, boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> <span class="DLF">Hamburg American line</span> , and went to the Cuban authorities in Berlin or whatever, and got landing visas separately, on their own, before they ever doc -- you know, boarded the ship. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And the -- and th-these were people who were, in fact, allowed to land. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But how far that’s accurate, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I suspect -- I can only cou -- my mother certainly had no idea, and I could never ask my father, that, you know, they were not going to be -- and all I’ve -- to be allowed to land, and all I’ve heard is that there were negotiations on -- whether they knew that, on board, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> cruised up and down the -- the <span class="REGION">eastern seaboard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I think that was done deliberately by the captain from what I’ve read, in the hope that something would materialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I gather it was really a negotiating tactic, with the -- again from what the -- what I’ve read or seen published, and that the -- the then president of the -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> couldn’t -- wouldn’t -- you know, wanted more money and there was a negotiating thing, and then suddenly the negotiation dropped down.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  No --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- about where they would get off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  -- what happened was, from what my mother told me is, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , or we -- perhaps it happened before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">My mother indicated to me that -- that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were set up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> of the St. Louis, everybody but -- now then, at that juncture, knew that there were a number of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe, <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> who were going to -- to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">My understanding was -- a th -- and my mother said to me there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> set out. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , takin -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And that you could -- you know, it wasn’t a lottery where names were put into a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">My mother said to me that she perhaps, without ra -- you know, thinking and -- about it, said that she might have been tempted, if it had been her choice, to try to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , because as a young teenager, her father had sent her with her brother to do a tour of Europe in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Lucky for them, they had the money to do it, and that she’d gone to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and she’d gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , you know, as a young teenager, perhaps in her seven -- at the age of 17 or 18, and because of that -- and she’d learned French at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , not English [indecipherable] that that would have been, because she’d been there once or so, it would have been nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">My father, apparently, paid absolutely no attention to this, and walked to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English table</span> , and sign up, for which there was not a -- initially, not a big demand. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Now, my father could speak a little bit English. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">He made a life and death decision, either comprehending a little bit of what might happen, because war talk was already in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , you have to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We’re talking now beginning of June, okay, and war didn’t -- took place in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Perhaps -- and I’ve often pondered about this myself, m-my -- my mother certainly couldn’t give me an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I thought myself, perhaps my father, from his four years in military experience, thought that perhaps being -- th-the 20 miles of <span class="DLF">channel</span> might be some diversion. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I don’t really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He made that decision, and obviously not one in which he was forced to do it, but voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And it was a life and death decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So we then ended up in th- the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The St. Louis didn’t take us to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> took us, called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Rocosus</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">St. Louis</span> didn’t take us to England, another vessel took us, called the Rocosus, if I am not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">My parents belongings, in these two containers and everything else, were offloaded from the St. Louis, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> American line, and dumped on the <span class="DLF">dockside</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , the <span class="DLF">Hamburg American line</span> , and dumped on the dockside. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The Rocosus -- and I don’t -- and obviously was not -- I don’t know, it was not a Hamburg American line, or it didn’t matter, wouldn’t load them onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> <span class="DLF">Hamburg American line</span> , or it didn’t matter, wouldn’t load them onto the boat to Southampton, they demanded money. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And my parents, or my father had absolutely no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And so these containers remained behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So other than our cabin luggage, which was put on board, all these things, and I just have often pondered what my parents thoughts were, seeing these, and knowing what was in there --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And the jewelry that she had sewn in --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, that’s what my mother told me, yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  Which would have helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And having no ability to -- to do anything, must have caused my father even bigger depression, I suspect, you know, or stunned silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We’ve -- I was able to talk to my mother about this years later, and we just hope that if they were left there, that ultimately they got bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">If they were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the Germans marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and they were put into some <span class="BUILDING">German storage houses</span> , hopefully they got damaged and burned, because they would never have known what they were sitting on. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  So I -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We’re laughing about -- this wasn’t a laughing matter, I don’t doubt, at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  I’m sure, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  And then we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> as far as I understand, and were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And this is really memory -- not really such accurate memory other -- you know, I’ve read about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we at -- we ended up in as -- the four of us -- I’m including my grandfather now, Grandfather Eisner, my mother’s father, were put up either in a two, or three, and I really don’t know -- certainly not more -- upstairs in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , 1n a -- 1n a -- in an area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camden town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The only thing which I really remember about this is that directly opposite the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a small <span class="DLF">park</span> on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and that I -- my parents allowed me, or I was able to play there. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It -- it was in summertime, we arrived in June -- all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I think that’s where I learned my English. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Very quickly, because when -- children have that ability, I think, 1f you follow what I’m getting at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  And obviously my parents were in no mood to sort of say to me, let’s go sightseeing, let’s do- I’m sure they -- I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So I was able to play there, and that’s a recollection which I have, obviously a pleasant one. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I have to conclude that that’s where I learned English, and m-my -- my mother has said to me that within about four or six weeks, I was fortunate enough -- and I then began to act as an interpreter --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  For them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  -- for them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Not with understanding, but to respond to the English questions an -- and so forth, if required, if required. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I don’t know who really paid the rent, or provided my parents with funds, or my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">My mother alway -- I -- I’m aware that the Jewish relief agency would -- did -- did provide some funds, but my mother always spoke very highly of Quakers in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and liberals. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Now, when I say liberals, I don’t think she meant it in the -- a political context, you know, liberal being democrat or -- or -- or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I think she meant liberal in the sense that there were decent liberal people who felt that yo -- that either part of their life was to be -- certainly not Jews, I -- I -- you know, the Jewish relief agency was doing one thing, Quakers obviously were -- were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I think she meant decent liberal people who felt a -- a sense of -- of -- of desire to help people who were in less fortunate circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And she always talked very highly of that, and they provided some means, but to what -- what extent I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But the Quaker thing, my mother always spoke extremely highly of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  What do you know about your father’s being taken to the Isle of Man, your father and your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Well, I think I have to go a little bit -- back a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  We were all together until war was declared --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  I-In September. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You may be aware of the fact that after the war was declared, the -- the -- the eng -- British government made a suggestion that children in -- living in the London area might wish, depending upon their parents, to be boarded int -- more into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> <span class="REGION">London area</span> might wish, depending upon their parents, to be boarded int -- more into the countryside. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Be -- I suppose they assumed that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was going to be a target area. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And they also said that mothers could go with them if they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Now how that was conveyed to my parents, I don’t know, but that’s what happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">My mother and I went on one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , together with other people re -- other ordinary people from lon -- from the <span class="REGION">London area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Nothing connected with Jews or Germans in any shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I don’t know exactly when, whether it was the end of the year, or the beginning of 1940, we ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , which is 50 miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And we remained there ever si -- you know, my parents remained there ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Now, I don’t know when my father and my grandfather -- they weren’t -- they never said they were arrested, they were interned. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was not like a German arrest, and it was not specifically geared to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It -- all aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">German aliens, and other ali -- I mean, other aliens, Austrian aliens, all connected with -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , were immediately rounded up, for want of a better word. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Some went to the Isle of Man, some went somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My father, and I believe my grandfather, went to the Isle of Man. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">In what particular month or -- or period, I’m not absolutely sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It must have been -- I’m -- perhaps end of sep -- end of 39, perhaps early °40.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  You’re not certain that your grandfather went --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I don’t -- I kno -- he was there, but I don’t know in what period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  They were both together, interned there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  And I’m not sure that they all turned up released. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It was not over but -- for my father and my grandfather, I -- I get the impression it was not a long internment. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And that’s the one thing which my father, he never referred to it as an arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He was able to comment to me about that, and he said it was really like being in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the military, and I think he was trying to compare it to World War I. And he never spoke ill of that situation, and I suspect if you compare it to what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , there were -- you know, there was no comparison whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I’m sure they were interviewed, perhaps several times, and I’m sure there must have been other German aliens, who may well have been German spies, who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for many years, o- or what have you, and they had to be weeded out. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But I don’t recall my grandfather or my father ever mentioning anything of what you would call an ill nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And, you know, the -- the fact that they were sleeping in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or -- or being interviewed, it was not in any shape and form, from what I gather, similar to what would have happened, or did happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and what subsequently happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  So I never -- and they certainly when I came out, there was no -- it didn’t look -- you know, I mean obviously it’s like being in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> , but it wasn’t in any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And ultimately they both joined us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">When, I don’t know, and where they came together, I don’t -- I can’t really recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">If it was 1940, then I was already five. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And in those days, you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the age of five in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So my concern -- my ma -- mother’s concern wasn’t getting me off- off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and you have to remember, by this time I was speaking English already, and it was not a long distance away, but again my mother spoke that the Quakers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , it was not a Jewish -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, I don’t know exactly what -- when that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The one thing which is interesting, the -- the -- the -- the German air raids on <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> at that time, had re-really started, and I remember my mother had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend, somewhat older. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I used to call her Aunt Margot. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She was not married, but she was more like a sister to my -- in other words they were <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, but the relationship was almost like sisters, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And she had fa -- I can’t tell you how, but she got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> on her own, and she was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and my mother apparently contacted her and said, “Why don’t you come and live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">You can get a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And -- and come stay with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I think my mother was worried, you know, with the air raids, and nightly bombing, my father not there, my grandfather not being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And so Margot Lewin, who had a brother in New York, and was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , which ultimately came through, but not until World War II was -- was over, and so forth, said all right, apparently, and -- and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , and very shortly got a job in a major manufacturing company, an ironwork company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the States, which ultimately came through, but not until World War II was -- was over, and so forth, said all right, apparently, and -- and came to Bedford, and very shortly got a job in a major <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing company</span> , an ironwork company in Bedford, as a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">She obviously knew enough English to be able to do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And she actually lived with us, and we all lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I think it made my mother feel a little bit more safe and secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I would call her Aunt Margot, you know, and she really became more of an aunt than a real aunt would have been, if you follow what I’m getting at. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And you know, we had nightly bombing raids at -- you know, sometimes two or three times during the night, and ri -- my mother -- my -- and we were living on the top floor of a -- of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , of -- of a three story ap -- <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> of a -- of a building, of -- of a three story ap -- house, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And my mother -- you know, you get very tired when you have to get up and dress and all the rest of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And my mother said to me -- said to us, and I think it was a general agreement, not bu -- I mean, they didn’t ask for my approval, I was -- that they weren’t going to get up any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">If it was -- if -- I think my mother said if it was God’s will the bomb was going to go down, it won’t make any difference if we’re upstairs or down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It’s going to take us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  So we ended up just sleeping through all this, not getting up any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And we would be woken up by the air raid warning to say that this was -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming, or the all clear siren, when they were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But, you know, we just didn’t get up any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">My -- my mother just made that decision, she said ge -- you kill yourself, I think -- or we will -- we will -- we will die out of sheer exhaustion, you know, or I don’t know quite, you know, how it’s --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  -- anyway, they stayed -- they were -- they were there together, and if fact I visited my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- not -- she’s not my real aunt --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  -- but if you understand what I mean, many years later, as -- as a married person, when I was already married, and she in fact -- and I then brought her from New York in -- in -- in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in -- in -- in a car. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I had a business ve -- trip, and I drove to New York for that specifically, picked her up from her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , drove her back to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for that specifically, picked her up from her apartment, drove her back to Canada, to Toronto. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">She stayed with us for two or three weeks, and then we put her on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> back to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  And you know, she was -- she was the type of aunt that, you know, if I needed pocket money, she was the one I would turn to. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And years later, when I was in the army overseas, after I was drafted in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , she would write to me, and whenever she wrote, she would always put some money in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So I was exchanging dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And she would always put some money in it -- she didn’t have any sons or daughters --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Oh, I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  -- 1f you understand what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  She only had nieces, and -- and to her I was really her nephew in that context.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  She was that close to my mother, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  To your mother, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That must have been a great comfort to your mother, to have a companion, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And it was a gr -- and -- and you know, it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">She was the type of aunt who was the accommodating type, in the sense that she made no demands on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">If anybody made any demands, it was me on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And -- and she was always obliging with -- with -- with so forth, so I have my -- my memories of her were -- were -- were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Then my father was released from the Isle of Man, and at that juncture we obviously couldn’t live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And then we -- we then moved to another --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Because you didn’t have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  No, well, we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and w -- and my -- and -- and my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  -- was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So we had to move, and it was -- and we needed a bit more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , or wer -- we -- you know, the landlady was not exactly the greatest. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I -- I don’t -- she was a -- she had a temper, I don’t mean that she was anti-Jewish, I think she was just a -- not a very accommodating person. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">She rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> out to various other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And I remember my telling how that one of the -- there was an old man living on one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and he said, “Don’t take any attention to Mrs. Morgan, she’s just naturally irritable.” </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So it wasn’t anything -- if -- if you understand me, it wasn’t anything bi -- against that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  Personal, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  She was just making money renting out <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And -- but I think the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were -- bu - that money came in from either the Quakers, or other liberal people in the -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , in the sense of decent people, actually, until such time. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And then at some point, and I don’t know when, probably sometime in the 40’s, my father came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , was released, so did my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We -- my mother made arrangements to move to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the three of us could be together, not far away from where we were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My -- she also made arrangements for my f -- grandfather to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by himself somewhere, in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And Aunt Margot, quote, unquote, also got a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for herself, and we went, and we progressed from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">My father then got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The one thing which I have always found very interesting is that we -- my parents did not, neither my father, my mother, or my grandfather, particularly after they ki -- were released from -- from the Isle of Man were not request -- did not have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> daily or weekly or monthly in any shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And I gather that that was a -- I -- I could be wrong, but I read somewhere years later, that that was a decision made by Prime Minister Churchill to say, look, if we’ve checked these people out, let’s not create a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We’ve got more important things to do than worry about having people go -- but whether that’s accurate or not, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  But I’m not aware that my parents or my father, or my grandfather had to report on a regular basis to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And we were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Nobody ever bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Nobody ever bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">In fact, it -- you -- it was perhaps typical English, you’ve got your freedom, you’re on your own now. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Which I found rather interesting in today’s context, where immigrants in various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , when they arrive, want -- make demands on all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We were just only too happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I’m sure my parents, you know, depressed, stunned, whatever, but they were left alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  They did not have to worry about being knocked up in the middle of the night by a police watrant or -- or what have you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  And I think that -- I know from my father’s point of view, that that impressed him, years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We didn’t actually talk about that, but I think he -- he -- his indication was that that -- that was something which made him, I suspect, feel a little bit better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Yeah, I --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  He was left alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  -- my guess though, is that for a while -- 1t would take you a while to relax, and even though you were in a safe community, to feel secure, especially after what he’d been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Even though nobody was --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I think this is --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- bothering him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  I think you’re right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  But it must -- yeah, let me -- I can -- Pll give you a very funny situation [indecipherable] I think you -- it’s -- 1t’s germane to what you’ve just said. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We were 50 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and on- On occasion some -- during the war years, we would take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , my mother and I, my father was working, just for a day’s outing. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I mean here I’m still at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I remember we were walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- walking down <span class="DLF">Oxford Street</span> , which is like <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It’s a bustling community, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It wasn’t exactly empty of people, even in war time. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And suddenly we saw, what my mother explained to me, an extremely Orthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and I mean, the complete regalia. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And my mother stopped to look around, and I had to stop and she said, “Look at that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And the only people stopping to look were my mother and myself, and I said, “Well, what is it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And she said, “But, that’s an Orthodox Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I didn’t quite know what she meant at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Well I think afterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked about this, my mother and I, is that it was so incredible, nobody paid the slightest attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was not an unnatural event. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They -- people just all were passing back -- my mother thought it was so unnatural in the -- in the context of what she’d left, to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">For me, I didn’t really think about this until years later, when I began to understand what she really meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But I remember her saying to me, “That’s a very Orthodox Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But I think she, a-as I say, she was wondering whether people would accost him, or -- or affront him, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But he just walked on, and nobody paid the slightest attention, other than ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And other people must have looked at us to see [indecipherable] why were we turning to -- looking at somebody else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  So that, I think, in answer to your comment, perhaps was the thing which may ult -- may have made my father -- my father never read a German newspaper any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He only read an English newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We talked in English and German, and as the years went by, we talked more English. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">My father never wrote a letter to me, other than in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Neither did my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Mind you, you have to remember I couldn’t, if they’d have written a letter in German I couldn’t have read it, because until I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years later, where -- where I had an option of learning -- I had to do French, but I also had an option of doing another foreign language, so I took German, but it was just school reading and writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And that just -- that’s how it -- you know, my parents never talked to me --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It’s pretty remarkable that, I mean, your father was in his late 30’s, almost 40 years old by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  No, when -- in that period of time, my father was born in 1893 --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  °93.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  -- so we’re talking let’s say, in --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  He was almost 50 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  And I was a small boy, I mean, he could have had a grandson by that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  And to -- you know, to turn away from his native language at that age is quite remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  Well, yea -- this is a little bit off -- off the thing, but I think it’s -- again it’s -- it’s relevant to your question. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Years later, when I had -- I made a business trip many years later to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- you know, to -- for the business discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And I thought, well Ill bring him back a decent German newspaper, me -- meaning a quality pa -- newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I’Il -- and I sat in [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span> , a book in German, which related to the -- to the period prior to World War I, and I bought it, thinking that he would like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He barely scanned the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He looked at the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I still have the book, I don’t have the paper, but I still have the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And he looked at the book and the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I think the title of the book was sort of, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , pre-World War I days, you know, of how people lived and so forth, which he would have understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He scanned it, put it awa -- he never read a German book, you know, he -- it was all English books, history and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And he -- that was a period he -- I don’t mean that he physically thought about it, and wi -- and made a -- an effort to show people, it just that he did not pay attention any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He didn’t listen to German newscasts on the BBC, it was always in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Of course his English continued to improve, as you can appreciate, but as far as he was concerned <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for him was, I suppose the equivalent of <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  In relationship to what he’d experienced, because nobody ever bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They didn’t ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">English people generally, bit more reserved, so didn’t ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And he wasn’t the type to want to answer, so he was just left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They thought he was a very nice person, he was courteous and pleasant, but he wasn’t forced to express himself to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I think that made a major difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  What kind of work did he get when he get when he -- when he [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, he couldn’t practice law because English common law, like American common law has absolutely no relationship to German law, so he could never practice his profession, and I think he was too old to -- to start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You have to remember he’d been a judge, and he’d been a barrister. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And there was no relationship, and w -- and we didn’t have the funds, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And -- and so he took a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and you know, he -- but really, I suppose any job, you know, beggars can’t be choosers, to put food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and pay the rent, and -- and -- and so forth, and th -- perhaps the one thing which one can say is that whilst he was free to do what he wanted, or was free to -- to live quietly, with nobody bothering him in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , that didn’t mean that the English government was going to help him get a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Did your parents have much of a social life? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Were friends over, or visiting other people, or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We lived in a one bedr -- one bedroom apartment with a little -- with one gas ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">You don’t have people coming over, if you understand what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We’d had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">For a long time we were -- my mother never had to do this, of course, but I can still remember -- 1n fact, after my mother died, and I went through her personal effects, I found the book -- she used to buy little -- little booklets, you know, and inside she daily jotted what she had bought in terms of groceries or so forth, because she had to make sure that we had enough money for rent and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She couldn’t stop herself afterwards, even when -- when it wasn’t necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">They -- it didn’t say ’'m doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They [indecipherable] no, you know, I mean, it wasn’t exactly a happy thing when I went through these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I -- I understood what she was about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  And if I asked for any money, she’d have to look through her purse and then check the book, and -- and say so forth, so no, we didn’t have -- yeah, people might come for a -- an hour or so, my -- my grandfather would come and -- and -- and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But he didn’t have very much, and so my mother -- my mother had to go out to work as well, to do housecleaning for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Mainly because t-to bring some money in. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And my f -- my grandfather couldn’t work, he was too old, or it wasn’t possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">His English was not that good, so she would provide -- give him money for -- he was -- he smoked cigarettes an-and -- and -- and so forth, but we didn’t -- to answer your question in a nutshell, did we have a social life? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I think my mother, she knew more people as a result of my going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because she met other mothers in the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But that wasn’t what you would call a social --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  -- although those -- those -- those acquaintanceships continued for many years, if you understand what I’m getting at, but they were not really what you would call -- where people would socialize, invite each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We didn’t have the funds and -- and m-my father certainly w- would not have -- he was -- he was too -- he was what I would call today in a clinical depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  That’s quite understandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yeah, and I think that that went -- I didn’t realize that until many years later, until I was an adult, and even then, it wasn’t until I got much older that I -- I -- I begin to thi -- thought about this, and understand now. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He went into depressions at weekends more than during the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And there were several times a -- I -- I rather think that my mother thought that he was going to try to commit suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Oh boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  He didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But he would leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on a Saturday morning sometimes, you know, he worked from Monday to Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">He’d get up in the morning, no breakfast -- this didn’t happen all the time, there were -- it was like a sort of periods, for no reason, and you have to remember his brother was still there, his mother was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">His -- his sister was in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , so that was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And he would go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Now, we lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there was a -- a -- a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , was a very nice little country town, bit like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , but a little bit broader, with <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and a major <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">country town</span> , bit like Alexandria down the road, but a little bit broader, with bridge and a major river running down, where every summer they’d have a huge regatta, and still do to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Think it was the third biggest regatta in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And it was sort of three miles on one side of the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> , we’d call it, and three miles on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And in summertime it was very nice, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> down there, and I -- I can remember they used to have a -- a <span class="DLF">bandstand</span> , and you know, they’d play military marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I mean, that was to keep people’s spirits up, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And he’d go out, and come four o’clock, or so, 3:30, my mother didn’t know where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I don’t know why sh -- the population was what, between 50 and 80,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Still really not much more than 80 or 90,000 to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It’s the -- it’s the county town of- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedfordshire</span> <span class="REGION">Bedfordshire</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">county town</span> of- of Bedfordshire. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I don’t know where my -- where my mother got the idea that I would find him, and I didn’t know where to look, but perhaps it oc -- I don’t know why, it occurred to me on -- once, that perhaps he might want to go and sit down on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , and perhaps that -- I didn’t know where to go, up and down <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you know, [indecipherable] find -- and sure enough I found him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He’d generally sit there on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He would just be sitting alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I’d come up, and he still wouldn’t talk, and I'd say, well it’s time for -- for supper, you know, for dinner, or supper or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Mom said it’s ready, you -- and he -- we - we got up and walked, but we didn’t talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That happened on several occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I don’t mean, ru- you know, every other month. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That happened on several occasions over a period of about -- perhaps between nine and 11 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And several, I don’t mean a huge amount, perhaps two or three or four times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  But over time, enough for you to --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  But that actually would da -- yeah -- no --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- understand that was going on for [indecipherable] period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  -- I didn’t really quite know, no, I just thought my father was a moody individual --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, at the time you wouldn’t know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  But that gradually eased to the point that eventually that never happened any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  What was it like for you in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Did you have any particular trouble in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, the first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to was like a -- like a typical <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> here, you know, grade one, two. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Two -- I think grade -- grade one we went in at five, and then at age 10 you went onto a- what would be the <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , or something like that, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Yeah, I did, but it wasn’t an anti-Jewish thing, it was because of my na -- m-my German surname. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I mean, John was, everybody understood that, and I’d occasionally get called, you know, German sausage or something like that, you know, but I mean these things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And you know, there was a time when I was probably having a fistfight, but not because it was anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I’d reached a point where I wasn’t going to take this, or couldn’t take this any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And you know how kids are, they can bully. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Now you ha -- you -- you either come to a conclusion that you have to -- you have to face this up, and -- and I never discussed this with my parents, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There wasn’t much point, my father was working, my mother was working, he was going to, you know --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What are they going to do, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  -- and but you know, there was a -- there was a period where I sort of had regular fights, but it was -- but I wasn’t the only one having these, these characters were doing this with other kids that -- you know, for whatever reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And it reached a point where ultimately, I must have obviously defended myself on my own sufficiently, that you become friends with the bully, and years later we would say hello to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You know, bullies, when they get taken on straight in, and not backing off as well, they go to the -- to the weakest. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I think it was really a choice of either taking a -- a whacking each time, or having to try and see if you could defend yourself, and I -- I -- I -- I’ve told my wife this, I had to know I -- whether I -- whether I hit and bit and kicked to the point where they didn’t want that happening, and gradually, over a period of time, th-that was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">That didn’t continue indefinitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But it was no -- I suppose a bit understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Meyerstein, that’s a German name, German sausage, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  You know, not a Jewish thing, because you know I don’t recall having that -- that --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">You mentioned earlier that while your father was at the Isle of Man, and you and your mother and your mother’s friend were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , living on the third floor, did bombs ever drop in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , did bombs ever drop in your neighborhood?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  They did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">When we moved -- when we moved to -- you have to remember this 1s not a big -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> was not a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewton</span> , which was 20 miles away, was the home of General Motors, okay, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> was the hub of a -- had a major railway station, it was a hub area for a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming in and out, and I think they were always trying -- and about 20 minute -- 15 minutes away by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , it was a hub area for a lot of trains coming in and out, and I think they were always trying -- and about 20 minute -- 15 minutes away by car, was the intake for all the RAF -- Air Force personnel, entering the -- the RAF, you know, if you understand what I’m getting at. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So there were --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Targets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Targets. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And sometimes, of course the -- the -- the air raid warnings would come on if they heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying overhead, even if they were not been a target, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And there was one occasion, not when we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , but when we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> m -- of my- just before my father came to join us, I -- I think, cause that’s the time we would have moved there, there was one really major bombing raid, and they were obviously going for the <span class="DLF">railway tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And the landlady and my mother, and I -- and this wasn’t a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , all got up and -- and we went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and you know, they had these old antique <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining tables</span> , round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining tables</span> , you know, solid, you would probably need six people to lift them. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I remember my mother pushing me under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and she and the landlady got underneath, because the fe - the -- the -- I think the feeling was, if the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> was coming in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was thick enough, and heavy enough to absorb this. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But nothing happened, other than the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> shook. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But there were time -- but you know, you get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">You know, I don’t say that that’s a great way of getting used to things --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  -- but we got used to -- you can’t panic, that’s -- what can you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  And there were one or two occasions when I would walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In fact, my daughters both called me at the time after 9-11 [indecipherable] and they were living there in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and said to me, “Dad, what happened when you were a youngster?” </span><span class="sentence" id="700">You know, and I said, “Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And I said, you know, Grandma was working, Granddad was working, and I was closer to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> than anywhere else, what was I going to do to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I couldn’t have got in anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I didn’t have a f -- a key. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So I just ran on to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I mean, what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">You know, they’re high up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">For youngsters sometimes that’s -- it’s a bit of an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I -- I don’t mean to demean that, your question or answer.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  This didn’t happen every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But, I mean, you get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">What could I do anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Ya -- you -- I think people have to le -- do learn to control panic now, obviously some people ma -- take 1t more seriously than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But this wasn’t a daily occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  But people do -- it was a war time, that’s why when I mentioned it, I thought my father was very heavily depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">In today’s context, that would probably be referred to for di -- for medical reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">You have to remember <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> left in Europe, alone, and a- a -- <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> didn’t come into World War II until ’41, after Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And that was towards the end of ’41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  So, you know, people didn’t have time to worry about were you depressed or --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  -- or worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">They had far more worries on their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I know that my mother -- if anything, my mother’s worry, where we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">W-We lived in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that she -- the landlady was very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Her name -- Mrs. Duncan, I remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And she had a -- her son was a pilot flying Mosquito bombers over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mosquito bombers</span> over Germany, and my mother was always terribly afraid that if something happened to him, Mrs. Duncan would turn on my mother, you know, he didn’t, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I -- I don’t know [indecipherable] she was very concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">But I remember one day -- my mother told me this, and I would have been, well, around six, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">One day my mother was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and a young army officer bi -- was at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and my mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and he saluted her and said, you know, “Is Mrs. Duncan in? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Mrs. Duncan?” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And my mother said, “She’s not in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And he said, “Oh, could you tell her, I’m her nephew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="733">You know, also in the military, but in the <span class="REGION">army side</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Saluted her, and wal -- and said, di -- “Would you let her know I passed by, I’m on leave,” or something like that. “</span><span class="sentence" id="735">She knows where I am.” </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And [indecipherable] for my mother to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But I think my mother could never get over the fact that, you know, if it had been a German officer, he would have sort of kicked the <span class="DLF">door</span> , or -- or I don’t know whether -- what she assumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  It’s just she couldn’t understand the courtesy with which --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  -- she was wi -- she was treated, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">No, so that was a sample of little -- little memories of -- of -- of which I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Do y --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  They both survived, and I met them years later as I was growing up a little bit, actually, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Do you have any r-recollection of the end of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="746">V-E day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Well I -- no, my rec -- not really, you know my recollections of D-Day were greater --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  -- because when you look -- well, for the simple reason that when you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and whe -- when I got up in the morning, there was a mass -- and looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , we couldn’t help it, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were enor -- constantly, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , so everybody knew something was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That, to me, was far more -- far more -- you know, I mean, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was dark with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , all going in one direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So, yo -- and -- and I bet that you -- your father probably followed that very closely in the papers, and I’m sure everybody did --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm, yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  -- at that -- at then -- in those times it was quite -- quite momentous for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Yes, I think he did, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  I -- I would imagine so. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">We didn’t discuss it, I don’t recall that -- I -- th-the one thing which, again, which is interesting in the context of how one views refugees today, when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they -- and I have these documents still, or booklets, wa -- they -- I don’t know whether wh -- whether the Jewish agency gave them out, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">They just said to the -- to th -- everybody got them, and I found them just recently, that, you know, don’t congregate together -- and they’re in engla -- in English, but to -- I think to German refugees in particular, don’t congregate together, don’t speak loudly, don’t speak in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Keep -- keep your head down, and -- and -- and pay attention to what’s going on, and -- and go about things, and do your work, and -- and don’t get in a -- don’t create problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I be -- perhaps I’m a little cynical, and I view other refugees, you know, wh-who come to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and almost demand -- perhaps an exaggeration, but expect things to be handed over. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">My parents didn’t expect anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Sometimes I wonder, when I look at this and say to myself, you know, we were [indecipherable] they did what -- they did that, they -- they kept away from public -- you know, they wouldn’t have gone out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to celebrate, because first of all, with accents, they would have had to explain themselves, they were just probably thankful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  But that didn’t really mean very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Because at that juncture, my father probably wouldn’t have known what happened to my father -- to my mother -- to his mother, and to his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">No idea, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Although we had Red Cross letters from my grandmother, up to 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  And -- but he had no idea, he -- in 1939, when we -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you to start again with the telegram.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein, this is tape two, side B. You -- you were mentioning --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  In 1939, from what I understand, from what my mother told me, my father received a telegram from his -- from his brother Hugo, presumably in ger -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I -- I’m not -- I assume so, or from somewhere, saying can you do anything to help me? </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He was married, no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Well, my father had no money, and no influence, no way -- and wouldn’t have known where to turn, let alone anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So presumably that cable never got answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I don’t know where the cable is, I’ve never seen it -- you know, I’ve not found it among the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  It must have been a heartbreaking thing for your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">The other thing, of course, you have to understand is that my father had the problems of his mother and his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">My mother and my grandfather had the problems of the grandmother, you know, my mother’s mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  She was still there, she was still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  My f -- my mother’s brother, Lota Eisner was also at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , also got out, and we met each other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And he, for some reason or other, got a permit to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">How it happened, I’ve no idea, he never explained it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We met years later and he -- I -- I’ve spoken to his children, my cousins, they don’t know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and ended up in the British army, joined the British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">My m -- the -- I -- my mother tells me that the reason -- or told me the reason that her mother didn’t leave was that he hadn’t left before we’d left. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So she was concerned that her only son would be left behind, so she wasn’t going to go, so she put -- forced my f -- ha -- my grandfather to go with us, but she wou -- didn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I don’t know, it -- it -- it’s a strange story, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  It is interesting, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  And I’Il include this to you because I think you’re going to find this rather interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">She was left behind, but her son got out before the World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Well --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, say -- say her name again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  I think -- let me put it this way, I don’t know how religious my father really was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Th -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> there was a germ -- a Jewish community, with a jewi -- with a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So then there’s no way to know, in a sense, what kind of impact this whole experience had on his belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">ANSWER:  I initially thought, for a long time, that his belief -- that he’d gone the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">That, in other words, he just didn’t believe in anything any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">ANSWER:  And sometimes I had the feeling that he did things because my mother was a little bit more keen and enthusiastic, and that in order to stop grumbles, he -- he went along with things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">He did not attend a lot of -- in the early stages -- you know, it was a small -- there were about half a dozen, my memory of there were about half a dozen English Jewish people living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> , where we g -- where I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Most of them, I think, had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They were English -- born in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">My mother -- we would go to the services, they were usually held in somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , at the -- at -- two or three times in the year, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And I did have a Bar Mitzvah, but it was in somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , cause there’s no <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , and there isn’t to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  Was there a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  They would try and get hold of a rabbi, I believe, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">If not, then whoever was most conversant and fluent, might take the service, if you follow what I’m getting --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">ANSWER:  Yeah, these women, and yo -- as I say, you can count the numbers who I can remember, barely on the fingers of, you know, two hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And perhaps the ones I’m thinking about, not even that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And they remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> long after the war was over, and they would always ask my mother, you know -- an-and I can remember sometimes meeting for a cup of tea in downtown Bedford, you know, in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">café</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Bedford</span> , you know, in a restaurant or a café or something, even during the war years, th-th -- two or three would get together, and I’d come along, and so how’s John, or how’s Johnny, and -- and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And -- so they, in their own way, I suspect, were almost adopting me without saying so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I don’t mean that in any, you know, affect -- loving way, but just -- 1t was- to them, that meant something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And another thing which I thought was rather interesting was that the moment I was called into the military service, my parent’s stock went up in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">People sa -- if -- you have to remember, I grew up in -- in the ca -- in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in a - in a-- ina community, particularly after World War II -- now we’re talking for -- World War II finished in ’46 -- °45, I’m talking now ’53, I-I’m on a -- IJ-I’m in the army on a way to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">That’s only eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">On the <span class="DLF">street</span> in which I grew up, or everywhere, there wasn’t somebody who didn’t have a brother, an uncle, a father, a grandfather, a nephew, a niece, somebody who hadn’t served in the -- in the -- in the British military, of which most would have had to be sent overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Very similar now to what I -- what we read and hear and see happening to Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So now my parents, people who -- English people would say, what’s happening to John? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So my parents were not long -- refugees in that context.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">QUESTION:  Uh-huh, they were full British citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">ANSWER:  Well, they were now viewed as being in the similar vein, and I think my parents -- I th -- not that we discussed it, but I’m looking back now, people would say, oh I met so and so, he wanted to know how you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">My mother in particular, my father didn’t -- wasn’t that way inclined, but my mother, among, you know, other English people, neighbors and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And I think that that had something to do with these other now elderly ladies, or quite older ladies, who again would sort of say, what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">It -- 1t seemed to raise the level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They weren’t refugees from German oppression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Somebody was doing equal things.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1282">ANSWER:  I did ask my parents -- my mother was quite keen to come and join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">My father -- we went for a walk, and you have to remember, my father was already now in his 80’s, or just -- yeah, beginning his 80’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And I asked him, and he said, “No,” he said, “I -- I’m too old.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">He says -- he looked upon North America, he liked everything which he saw, but he thought it was a younger person’s <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="REGION">North America</span> , he liked everything which he saw, but he thought it was a younger person’s country. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And for him I think it would have been re-rooting another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , took him long enough to plant in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , if you want to put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I think that would have been too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">My mother, I think, was interested in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I think my father found his English solitude comforting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">He -- he was very much an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> unto himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">You can’t really live that way, but he tried his utmost to -- to -- t-to -- to activate that sort of situation, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">But they didn’t come again -- he didn’t come again, and -- and -- and that’s quite an effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">In those days they really wanted, you know, they didn’t like if -- people who were quite old to fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I mean, he was physically fit okay, but I mean, he was in his 80’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I mean, can you imagine what would have happened if he’d had a heart attack or something, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And -- an -- as you were then left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and had your own life, and children of your own, how did you integrate your earlier experiences with your later life, and -- and were you able to move ahead, and did it motivate you in any way, either socially, or politically, or rel -- in a -- in a -- in terms of a religious community, can you -- are you able to -- to sort of understand how those early years formed you and affected you later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  I think -- that’s not an easy question to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">QUESTION:  I know, it’s a hard -- it’s very hard as a -- it’s a --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I certainly think that the -- the early years made me much more self sufficient, or reliant upon myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">My parents didn’t, for a long time, didn’t know a lot of people -- and I’m talking about people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , English people to whom they could ask questions and -- as to what one should be doing, how should we do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">So everything which I thought about, or wanted to do, I would have to sort of glean for myself through my questions, wondi -- wondering whether that person would know what I was talking about or so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">So, i1-it made me stand on my own feet, equally so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">My military experiences certainly helped in that, because in those days when you went for a job interview, more or less any company would ask, have you been in the military? </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , what sort of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to, and have you served in the military and the third question was, have you served overseas? </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And I think the reason for that was that they felt if -- if those three things all tied together, they had a reliable, disciplined person, who would understand what to do, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Now whether that’s true today, I suspect not to the same degree at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">M-My father being so much older, was -- wasn’t -- wasn’t that easy to relate in terms, I mean, when I -- I watch -- I go out to watch our grandkids play soccer or something like that, and we -- and we’re not close together, we -- they live very far apart, but when we do -- or we’ve done for our own kids when they were doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Girls play soccer these days now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I don’t mean that in a silly way, but --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  -- but my father didn’t have the time or the energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER:  You know, af -- and probably was still too depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And my mother was also working in whatever shape or form to bring some extra money in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">Not the nicest of jobs, you know, cleaning floors, and washing clothes in -- 1n a -- in somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">cleaning floors</span> , and washing clothes in -- 1n a -- in somebody’s house is not exactly what she was used to, but it paid the -- it paid bills, and eventually she didn’t have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">So, I didn’t really have that -- that close-knit relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I was very grateful to my father for making sure, and going out of his way, with all his efforts to get me a good education, and -- and a certain standard of -- of -- of decency, and -- and -- and how to live, and how to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And the -- and that -- you know, the behavior -- to him, behavior and dignity were terribly important, which I think you can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">My mother was a much more emotional person, I think became somewhat more religious in later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">But we didn’t talk a great deal about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">It -- perhaps that was the way German Jews, who had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for such -- and I don’t mean that in any demeaning way, had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed themselves as Germans of a Jewish religion, 1-1f you understand, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">QUESTION:  Quite a different thing, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">ANSWER:  Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">ANSWER:  And we didn’t talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Nobody made any demands upon anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And it’s very hard for me to understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">When I went to get a job interview, when I was being inter -- in -- and I’m only speaking about my experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , nobody ever asked, you know, what religion are you, 1-1f you understand what I’m getting at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">QUESTION:  Yes, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">ANSWER:  I mean, just to give you an illustration of how these -- I’m only speaking now from the English point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Years later I’m living in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I’m running a business of my own, and dealing with British companies of quite sizable renown and -- renow -- renown in -- in their own <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And suddenly I’m asked -- I get a call from -- from -- from a senior army officer from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> saying we’re going to be in eng -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> in a short period of [indecipherable] we’d like you to consider being an honorary defense industries representative for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">It’s purely honorary, it doesn’t pay anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Would you be interested? </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And I thought to my -- well, I -- I said yes, you know, I mean, no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And I thought to myself -- he came and 1n typical English way we met, had a meal, some drinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">He knew exactly what <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I’d been to, where I’d done my service, who I was representing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I have to assume that some of the companies from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , who deal with Department of National Defense said we have so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And they want -- and he said it’s purely honorary, but it opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to a lot of scenarios. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And I said to my wife after, isn’t it funny a German Jewish refugee, sitting in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> now, has been asked to be an honorary situation in this way, where I’d come, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  And I -- I mean, this is many years -- a number of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And I thought, what an achievement for myself, you know, 1-if I can view it in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">ANSWER:  I just thought it was a great -- it was an honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">ANSWER:  I don’t know how much it really benefited me, but it was -- I thought 1t was an honor to me, as to how far I’d come, and the -- and the -- the -- the feeling of -- of -- of being able to have somebody ask that, and not sort of say, where are your antecedents, and -- and -- and -- and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">ANSWER:  And so these things had -- but nobody said to me, are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">What religion are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Are you a refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Were you the son of a refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Now, why would they ask in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but my parents didn’t talk about the St. Louis to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They talked perhaps, to other Jewish, in that little group --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  -- about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And if somebody who had an understanding, like yourself, they might -- my mother -- certainly my father wouldn’t have discussed it with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1653">ANSWER:  In fact, I would have to anticipate, I don’t know the figures, and we did talk about this earlier yesterday, I have a very great feeling that most of them -- there are survivors, but I don’t think they survived in -- I mean, from my perspective, we didn’t have a lot of money, but we had clothes, and sho -- and en-enough food to eat, whether it was -- whether we had -- we didn’t have meat every day, but we were on rationing like everybody else in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">But it didn’t seem to affect my health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">I was accepted at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , nobody questioned me, nobody criticized me, no teacher made derogatory remarks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">And when my parents in -- or my mother in the beginning, went to see a teacher in her broken English, nobody laughed at her or -- or denigrated her, or talked about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">So perhaps we ha -- we have something to be grateful for, but have I become cynical? </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">I suppose so, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">More so than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , do you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">Cause we survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> .</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  -- yeah, you see, I’m sure that 1t must have been terrible for my parents, and my grandfather, not knowing in those -- in that period when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> turned around and we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or it was finally determined that we could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">And obviously, when my father made the decision, my grandfather must have made the s -- followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">I mean, 1t would have been ridiculous if he had gone somewhere else, but he could have done, I mean, he was his own man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">He didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">Thank goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">He -- we all -- perhaps they discussed it, and my -- or my father may have talked to my father -- grandfather about it, and said, “I’m going, we’re going to do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">And he might have said -- they might have agreed on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">It was never discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">But it’s very hard for me cause I was not part of that conversation, and you ask me perhaps -- and you started off at the beginning by sort of saying sometimes parents try to shield their children, what could I have contributed to it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">I’m sure my father didn’t talk to my mother about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , or what little -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continue -- this 1s a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape number four, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never discussed those things, but my mother, when we talked about the St. Louis, or she mentioned it to other -- generally German refugees earlier in the war, when they got together in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> This is tape number four, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never discussed those things, but my mother, when we talked about the St. Louis, or she mentioned it to other -- generally German refugees earlier in the war, when they got together in -- in Bedford, you know, three or four people, or something, they would -- or they would talk to each other and -- and the St. Louis might well come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">I don’t recall my mother ever saying to me, or in her presence, because they were always -- and I was always taken along at these things, because they had nowhere to leave me, my mother, and didn’t want to leave me anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">And -- and so she would be talking in German, and when she mentioned the St. Louis, I don’t ever recall her saying that she had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was rude to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">Now usually, if somebody was rude, or crude, or showed impatience or something, I’m sure she would have made a comment about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">My mo -- my mother was rather me- meticulous a-about that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">I never heard her say anything which was like a derogatory scenario. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">Obviously, of course, it was from the -- from the point of view of where we were going to land, was serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">But I don’t recall her ever mentioning that -- that the people as -- the staff of the -- of the crew, either on the way out, or on the way back to Europe, were unpleasant, as far as she was -- a -- as something which she could have said had impacted upon her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">Now, whether that happened with -- you know, in the same way to -- to 999 other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> , I don’t know, and I can’t say, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">But in that context, that’s perhaps another way of trying to explain to you that, you know, the -- for me -- for -- I think for my parents it was always the question of where would they end up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">Because don’t forget, my father probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don’t have a piece of paper saying that, but I’m pretty sure that for my father, he was under notice, as must -- must have been my grandfather, if you are not out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within some things, we will be back for you and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> will be even worse than it already 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">Now, on the other hand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my grandmother on my father’s side was still alive and writing to us in April of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">We received it in June *42, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">Now, in the same year, in September, she was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and died a month later, we just got that confirmed yesterday, okay, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">I just had that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague downstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">And it’s taken me a long time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">How many -- over half a century to find that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">So how did these things happen, it’s -- it’s conceivable that the people would have remained where they were for awhile, before all these really horrendous things, in terms of transportation, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">In other words was building up, but it didn’t happen in -- in one month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">I’m not trying to minimize that, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">So it’s possible that my parents could have lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> from somewhat longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">But I think that my father was under sentence, if you follow what I’m getting at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1695">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1696">ANSWER:  I’ve often wondered how he got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">You know, y -- I -- and I -- I -- I’ve -- I’ve -- | -- I -- the only rea -- and there’s nothing on paper, and he never discussed it, but I’ve read documentation to say that, you know, World War I veterans were -- were released with an understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">However, I’ve also pondered my father being -- having been the outside counsel for I.G.

<p>QUESTION:  The equivalent of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1700">ANSWER:  It’s -- it was a card game, like <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1703">ANSWER:  And per -- I don’t know whether it’s weekly or monthly, my mother would have -- the -- it would be arranged that my parents -- a combination -- my father had his business on a <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> of an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">Half the fi -- a -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , was the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for living and the other half was his private practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">And the -- you know, this would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> of four and six, and she would have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buffet</span> done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">This is after Hitler still is around, can you beat this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And Is -- used to ask -- I asked her [indecipherable] I said -- I said, “And they were all Jewish people?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And is -- no, there might have been a couple of Jews, and the rest were, you know, people from either a judge or somebody else, who were not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">And my -- my -- I do recall my father saying to me, that had things got very bad, he had already made arrangements with people he knew, who would take me -- and they were obviously all known Jewish people, and -- but it never came up, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">Now who they were, what they were, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">And I’ve often wondered whether some of these people may not have -- you know, they were not, you know, they were pretty senior people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of -- I suspect [indecipherable] people who were known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know, if it was -- if it was legal or otherwise, whether that didn’t help him get out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">You can’t tell, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">It’s -- it’s a strange -- I don’t know.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1717">ANSWER:  -- to those, and then nobody’s alive to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1718">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">I wanted to ask you about this -- this is sort of a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> kind of centered question, but since you received this notice that this search was going on for survivors, and you’ve come into contact with all this information and been thinking about it, and maybe in -- in a different kind of way, or through a different kind of lens, and come here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and you’ve answered this question partially, but how has this brought you either any kind of new understanding, or specific kind of information about your family that otherwise may not have happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1720">ANSWER:  That’s it -- you’ve got -- there’s several questions in that one question.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1727">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">What I -- what has happened is, in coming here, and -- and -- and through the generous help of people like yourself and others, I’ve managed, after all these years, on behalf of my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> who 1s in her 80’s now, to get closure on my grandmothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">I have a -- I have a -- a date on which she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">So we now know where she died, and on the day in which, cause you know, it -- it turns out the Germans were meticulous, it seemed, in stating --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1731">ANSWER:  -- where the dates are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">That was my main reason, I have to be truthful with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">I can’t do anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">I didn’t initiate the project, you’re initiating the project, or the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I think it’s great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">And it -- and -- but I have to say to you, there’s not much I can --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Gain from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1736">ANSWER:  -- gain, because even though I was on it, from my personal experience it wasn’t horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">At least I don’t think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">I can’t answer for my parents any more, because they’re dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">Whether I ca -- and they really made no reference to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , other than it was a voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">And they couldn’t get into <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and they couldn’t get into the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> was really their -- the -- the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">weigh station</span> , if you want to put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">I don’t know, you know, beyond that I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">I -- I’m glad that I -- I got acquainted with you all, because the -- the people here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> are doing their best to answer some other questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">I got my first answer yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">I think I posed three questions -- actually four, but three of the more serious ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">My fourth question really was to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , what are you planning to do with all this, you know, as far as the St. Louis is concerned, but that’s not a -- that’s not a -- a -- a family issue, Okay, in that context. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">I had three serious questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">The first one got answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1749">QUESTION:  About your grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1750">ANSWER:  About my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">And was -- my cousin, I al-already guessed, we had no closure date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">So this means I don’t have to -- to -- to -- to -- to have a -- a what do they call it, a plaque put up somewhere else to do th -- I do now know where she 1s, okay, and I can, in -- in -- 1n any little family book, I can put down died so and so, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">How she died, I don’t want to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">I suspect that there’s a -- she was only in her mid-70’s, people live to much older ages these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">So why should it have happened, how could it have happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">I don’t even ask those questions, cause I won’t get any answer, and all I’ll do is make myself angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">If you -- if you understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1758">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1759">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">So I’ve got closure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">What I really would like to do, perhaps on my father’s behalf, 1s find out what happened to his elder brother, and that’s going to be a lot harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1762">QUESTION:  Hugo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1763">ANSWER:  Yeah, now he obviously died early in -- and in -- where, and under what circumstances, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">My mother always said that he had sort of fled eastwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">But if he fled too far east, how did he end up getting a cable -- how did he get to find out where we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to send us a telegram? </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">And why did he end up coming back the other way, and dying in a -- as a result of quote unquote, the term hospitalization which my grandmother, well, it was typed out for her, and we have to ask what that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">How would she have known about that so early in the war, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">So where was he, if she’d have known that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">I mean, I can’t believe that everybody [indecipherable] these <span class="REGION">unoccupied territories</span> would have been so keen to start sending out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">And - and I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has mentioned that it’s really more in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that all these things were kept meticulously, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Just as well they were now today, because that means we can trace them, and we can complain about them, and -- and -- and quote for some people, perhaps it may give them some claim in their old age where they might need the restitution which they’re entitled to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">But I don’t know, that’s really what I’d want to get out of this thing, and I’m not -- and because if y -- I hadn’t been made aware of this, and I didn’t even see it in the -- I -- you know, the Washington Post isn’t read daily by everybody overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">And it isn’t read everywhere daily in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1774">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1775">ANSWER:  We winter down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> in -- for three months with our daughter, younger daughter who lives there permanently, and we had the Houston Chronicle delivered to us every day, so you know, I wasn’t rushing out to get the Washington Post. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">And I didn’t -- wasn’t aware of it, even though apparently it was advertised in other papers, and a friend of ours, who is actually the -- the godfather of our younger daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , who lives in -- here in -- and worked as a -- we met each other years ago in -- overseas, and he became -- he and his wife became godparents to my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">He was in the foreign service, and we’ve kept in touch over the -- over the time, and he called me, and said, “Did you know about this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">He said, “You haven’t seen,” - I said, “Well, I don’t normally take the wa -- Washington Post.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">I said, “The easiest one to get, where we are, is actually the New York Times, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1781">QUESTION:  New York Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1782">ANSWER:  And I’m not trying to denigrate the Washington Post. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">But I said, “I didn’t see anything like that in the Wall Street Journal,” I get that every day on my <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> at six in the morning at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and -- with our other papers -- and he said, “Ill send it to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And that’s where it all started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">But for me at that juncture, 1t was important because your colleagues here all offered to be of help if they could, which was very generous and I appreciate that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">The other thing is, it wasn’t until my mother died, in 2001, that I got a chance to go through all these papers, cause up to that time, she was really -- kept them boxed, bagged, and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">And it was quite a difficult process, because when you consider when th -- their ages when they both died -- so the Germans didn’t win that game -- it was almost a hundred years of documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">And the very serious things were all in German, and in all German writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">You know, not the Romanized way we see it today, you know [indecipherable] we’re talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">And I’ve had to really, piece by piece, and it wasn’t until last year that I went -- that I took back with me, or went through the li -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the last box of papers and pictures, which somebody very gener -- kindly and generously kept for me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">You know, it’s -- it’s not easy to take things back in bags, and all the rest of this, you know --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No, I can’t imagine it, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1792">ANSWER:  -- you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">And so that has, to some degree, sparked off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">And then when my cousins asked me on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> to submit these claims, I then really had to dig into this material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">Luckily, I had it now, but it’s still very time consuming, because the answers aren’t always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">So then when this thing came up, at the end of last year, al -- I thought to myself -- perhaps I’m being a bit selfish here, perhaps this is a way in which I can get some answers, not so much for claims or anything else, but on what happened to my grandmother, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">What happened to my Uncle Hugo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">Those were the two --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">Pressing -- pressing questions for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1800">ANSWER:  -- priority questions actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">I am a little skeptical about what I get [indecipherable] mind, because even downstairs in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , the people who deal with that, the ones who found what happened to my grandmother said it’s very -- that could prove to be very, very difficult, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">And why would he have been rounded up immediately, that’s you know, do you under -- do you follow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1803">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1804">ANSWER:  You know, the real serious round-ups -- I mean my grandmother wasn’t -- wasn’t deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> until 19 -- 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">The war broke out in 39, if Hitler was putting all the Jews in, why didn’t they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop? </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">So I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">It’s -- it’s very confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">But who s -- who knows what [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">I -- I -- I don’t know how other than to answer you -- that question, and then put some of these things to rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1810">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1811">ANSWER:  I’m -- I’m not a great believer in dwelling indefinitely on these things, mentally and physically, it doesn’t do you well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">I can’t -- I couldn’t stop it then, I can’t stop -- stop it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">I don’t want to leave my daughters with an inheritance of trying to find something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">They know where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">They know how they got from A to B, they know who their parents are, they know who their grandparents are, they both met the -- one set of grandparents, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">They -- they know from pictures and everything else where they came from, and how far they can -- they can trace back their particular roots --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Pretty far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1817">ANSWER:  Pretty far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1818">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1819">ANSWER:  So they really don’t need to do chasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">It’s not easy, and sometimes it’s really quite -- how can I put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">Draining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">You know, for the simple reason that reading or looking at these things can make people very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">And I must admit it causes me some anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">Other people view it differently, so perhaps I’m being a little bit selfish in having the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> do these things for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">If this is a way in which I can, from my point of view, to aid what you’re talking about, do this oral history, of which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> is a part, then it’s -- it’s my way of saying thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">And I think it’s worthwhile, but how much the contribution is to future generations, I’d like to believe that it will be, but I’ve lived and worked in quite a few parts of the world, and I’ve had to step in ironically on behalf of others, purely as a westerner in some parts of the world, for people who came -- I sometimes -- I -- I’m perhaps -- I say to myself -- you know, I -- let’s hope that these things don’t happen again, irrespective of -- to whichever group of people or otherwise- and that’s about as much as I can say to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1827">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">Well, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">I wish you good luck on the rest of your search.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1830">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
