QUESTION:  It’s unusual for two reasons: that a Lithuanian is born in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and two, that he’s delivered by a veterinarian.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  That’s his <span class="BUILDING">cavalry school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Did — how many years — do you remember how many years it lasted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, I’m not exactly sure, but I would think probably sometime between ’28 and °30.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So, in 1930 you come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and you probably have no memories of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Very foggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">In fact, when I visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pinerolo</span> some years ago, I recognized the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was being carried around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Okay, well, I think he was born in 19 — I’m sorry 1893. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And there’s a confusion about the date because it was at that time there was the old calendar, that was changed later. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I think his birthday is on the 18" of January in 19 — I mean, 1893.</span></p>
