<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well, I thought it was O.K.. As a child I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my father worked always very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Sometimes day and night to support the whole family because he was the only one working in the family to provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My life was, I would say, normal, according to the circumstances in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the Polish occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  For example, your father as a tailor, did he have his own <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well, at certain times he did have a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> for himself but most of the time he worked in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which 1s eight kilometers from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> , it’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abarrov</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="20">and he worked there as a custom tailor for the people of commerce that lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he was always hired by them by the week to work and he used to move into their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> while he was sewing for the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  And was he originally from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  No, he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> but he used to go away for the whole week and come back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on Friday nights for the weekend, like for Shabbat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  How did he come and go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Most of the time he would walk the eight kilometers to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or he used to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That was only about twenty minute’s ride by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  You mentioned going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I went to all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">As a child, and I can give you exactly the, before I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , I must have been six, five or six, I used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Like to a rabbi to learn Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I used to go to a small Talmud Torah also before, and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , which was compulsory at the time, when I was seven years old, in <span class="BUILDING">Polish public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And after I finished, I went to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">specialized school</span> sponsored by ORT, American ORT, for three years to learn how to become an inspector for tailors which was only about twenty boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Specialized for the Polish government to spread them all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to become inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Is this what you wanted to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Each tailor that opened up a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> had to have a diploma, a master’s diploma, before he could open up and he had to get it from this kind of inspectors to see if they are good tailors or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  So, conceivably you may have become your father’s inspector?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  My father would have been probably too old by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheder</span> until you were 12 or 13?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  No, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheder</span> in the evenings after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the rest of the time I spent in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Until what age did you finish <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  1936 and then I switched over to that <span class="BUILDING">specialized school</span> , ORT, which happened to be that we were supposed to graduate just 100 days before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">No, the 100 days before graduation the war started and that interrupted the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  And this was in 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  1939, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  So that was a <span class="BUILDING">public government school</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  It was, no, it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> sponsored by ORT.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  The government didn’t subsidize it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Your brothers and sister, did they follow you in going to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Well, my, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My second brother and third brother were going to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and the little ones were not of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> age yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  What languages were spoken at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  In my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Outside we spoke Ukrainian and Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  How were relations between Jews and non-Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> itself there was, I would say, eighty-five to ninety percent Jewish and so we used the Polish language and Yiddish and we had very little to do with other nationalities except <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where we used to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it and that was part of life, sorta. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So we accepted it as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Do you recall any specific instances of anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Well, yes, there was plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I, myself, before the war, my looks are not, typical sort of Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I have blue eyes and not a typical. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I used to be able to walk on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was standing, the <span class="BUILDING">Polish church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was called Koschua (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="66">in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> where I observed and read the literature put out in front of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> against the Jews and anything that was possible to print and make hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So I used to relay this information to others because it was a little dangerous to walk on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that’s the only kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I came across, myself, before the war, certain episodes like, when I used to walk to visit my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abarrov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I had to pass a little section where only Polish people live and as I was walking some youngsters would attack Jewish guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The episode was that as I was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , one was screaming in Polish, “Der is Yid, der is Yid . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That means, “is a Jew, catch him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="73">When the other friend of his came and said are you a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And somehow because of that asking the question where is the Jew, he was puzzled. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He didn’t know I was Jewish and he let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">This is the kind of things as youngsters we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There was anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Were any of your brothers accosted in similar ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  No, my brothers they were younger and they didn’t do out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They didn’t travel outside the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> so they didn’t have any experiences like that, except going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  How about your teachers at <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Well, I personally didn’t have any problems with teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The only thing I did have a problem was because I was Jewish, they transferred me from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was next to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to two kilometers further, which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Degrabnik</span> all the way in the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I had to walk every day to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , two kilometers each way, yet there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> next door to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Did you live in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  How about relations between your father and his customers? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Earlier you mentioned that he provided customized tailoring for farmers and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He had good relations with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was no problem at that time, among the Ukrainian people, and my father that worked for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He used to stay in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , they treated him like their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  When he walked, he wasn’t approached the way that you were approached?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  You mentioned that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wasn’t the big problem, but I am just wondering whether after the 1935, after 1936 with the death of Pilsudski, whether you saw any changes either in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Right after the death of Pilsudski, which the Jewish people liked, there was another Marshall, I think his name was Rydz-Smigly and his government looks like change. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because as a youngster I realized that we had a lot of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The first thing, I think that the government was infiltrated with German people and they made new laws, especially for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Where they made them eat non-kosher foods, they didn’t allow them to kill like the Jewish way of kosher, and I think the woman was called Madame Priestaroba that was in charge of all this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Just to give the Jews a little problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Did this affect you in anyway in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , for example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Personally, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it didn’t affect us but I remember there was a lot of problems among the Jews for that problem about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kashrut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They didn’t eat meat because they wouldn’t eat non- kosher meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Did these changes affect your father in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  I couldn’t tell at the time, I was too young to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">All I knew there was no kosher food for a long time and there was a strike against the government and the Jews didn’t eat any meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Were you a good student?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Fairly good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I did not get into it although I had a friend whose father was a communist and was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for five years for communism and he was a good friend of mine and we used to talk about other ways of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was only studying this but I didn’t belong to this kind of group at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  What was the political orientation of your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well, mainly Zionist orientated. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Talking about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We had organizations, Zionist organizations all kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was there was Agudas Yisroel, there was a lot of different Zionist organizations and I belonged to some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Which ones did you belong to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  I belonged to once Agudas Yisroel, which is the religious Zionist organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization like . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I used to walk from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Ukrainian families took us in and when the Russians were approaching the Ukrainians were not so happy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They would have rather had the Germans come in than the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Somehow I assume that the relations between the communist Russians and the Ukrainians were not so good and they were afraid for the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And as the Russians came in they asked us to leave their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and go back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which we did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER: ” — Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">One June the 22™, early in the morning about 4 o’clock in the morning, being that I was on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and working on the railroad at that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , 1n the morning I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> overhead fighting with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That was the start of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Already I saw one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> shot down by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> and that pilot landed not far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He parachuted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I saw the Germans were flying around him while he was being parachuted and they were shooting at him flying down. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They made a few holes in the parachute, but they didn’t get him and he safely landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That’s how we knew that something was going on between the Germans and the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">At 12 0’clock that day, the, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Molotov</span> at the time, announced that there was war and attack on <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and there was war between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The first few hours while I was there, the <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> between and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lutzk</span> was cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So, we already were paralyzed on the railroad because the Germans bombarded the railroad and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were coming into our <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My chief of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> knew about that, that we were paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He was upset, he had his whole family, he was a Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">He was the chief of that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I worked under his command. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And, he said to me that you stay over here I will take my family with the children and take them out to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I saw that there was no reason for me to stay at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> because there was no communication and there was no connection between the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> already, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying all by myself in that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I knew the Germans were close by, so I said why do I have to stay here, there is nothing to do anyway now, why won’t I go with you and help you to evacuate your family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubov</span> and then we will together come back to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Well, he agreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it was the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> left on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We camouflaged one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> traveling to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We never made it back, because the Germans occupied that part and from there on we did not stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubov</span> , but we got connected to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and we traveled towards the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> in the east, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we had, I remember, a open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platform train</span> , where old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were open like <span class="DLF">platforms</span> and we took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> which took us a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I would say about three days to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubov</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> because of the bombardments from the <span class="DLF">air</span> by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Every time we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> we had to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , run off to the sides, hide because they were shooting, they were flying very low and shooting at us with the automatic machine guns from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">When they were gone, we continued until I came to where I was still assigned to the railroad and this , which I mentioned before was twelve kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I think it was June the 25". </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Being that was only twelve kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> and my family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> , and I didn’t see them for a long time, I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> to see my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I was assigned to a post to be back at 10 o’clock at night, to watch a certain part of the main <span class="DLF">terminal</span> of and I was free until 10 o’clock that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> and met my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  They didn’t know you were coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  They didn’t know I was coming, they were very happy to see me, they thought I was already dead, maybe, or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardments while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">During the day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> used to fly in and bombard sections of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">In order for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kapkaz</span> that was the other part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like one section 1s towards east of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like facing the Russians and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Tape 1, Side 1
ANSWER:  To bring them over to that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was already late and I had to go back to where I was assigned to be there at 10 o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Because about 7:30 or 8’clock, I left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my whole family and (a portion of tape is blank).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  I am going to repeat a few sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">When I brought my family over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kafkaz</span> it was late in the day and I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> where I was assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We didn’t know at the time that the Germans are going to take over most of the <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We figured it’s just a temporary thing and the Russians are going to be able to fight back the Germans and life 1s going to go on normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was responsible for my job where I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> so I had to leave my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My mother did not want me to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She insisted I should stay with the family, in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I spoke to my father, he was more like sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I remember and I’ll never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your own decisions what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">If you think that it 1s important for you to go back, then you have to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So I had no problems with my father, but my mother was insisting I should stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I made up my mind to go back because I felt that if I don’t, I will be responsible for the job I’m supposed to do on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> because it is a major depot place where soldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they had to be transported from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other and it was important for me to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So, I said to my parents that I’m going to be there tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">After I finish my job in the morning I’ll see you back. [</span><span class="sentence" id="313">ll come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and see you again. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">On the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half way, from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> there was an attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was sort of getting dark that day, already late in the day, and I was walking with the <span class="DLF">road</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , that’s how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> and a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming towards us and there were another few people and everyone was hiding and I was also hiding from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We didn’t know they were going to attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> , towards the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">A few minutes later I looked out, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> they spread like sort of in one <span class="DLF">line</span> and they attacked the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> from one end to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And a few minutes later I saw the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I was six kilometers out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was very hard for me to make a decision what to do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I didn’t know whether my family was killed at the time or not, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was on fire from one end to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I made a decision to go to work because I figured like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">If I don’t go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter, because I was sort of mobilized already by the Russian army to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , and then they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">If my family is dead, I won’t see them anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Being that I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobonov</span> I was on my place of work, watching the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middle, like already dark later on, we had attacks by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  How about the one in which your family was hiding in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  No, that didn’t survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I couldn’t even recognize the <span class="REGION">area</span> where my family was. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was completely rebuilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was rebuilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It had only happened a few years ago when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">When I saw this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> , I wasn’t able to remain because my transport was going toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovid</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I had to stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that was taking me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> until I came to the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> somewheres near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">When I first got off, on the first <span class="BUILDING">station</span> as we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us out and we immediately noticed the anti- Semitism right away was worse than it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They greeted us with hatred and you can understand what kind of feeling I had and I thought I made a mistake coming back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> only to have freedom, but I didn’t find it in the behavior of the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So I traveled from there to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It was somewheres, I think it was , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It used to be a German, a lot of German people used to live there before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">When I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> a group of Zionist, young people, came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and asked all the young Jewish people that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to join the Zionist organization and from there go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Being that I was single and I didn’t find my family, I knew I was all alone and young, I decided to join this organization which I was with them for quite a while and working with the organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">If it was of interest to you, this whole organization was trying to snuggle into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time, under the British occupation and the situation at that time before the Jewish State was established, was controlled by the British and they didn’t allow any Jewish people to settle, they took them all to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cypress</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they caught them on the open <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But, nevertheless, we all tried very hard to get there one way or the other, because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was no more a place for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">During the time I was in that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I was assigned from the organization to go on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and buy out all the soap, which was called Rif, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was called , it was made out of Jewish people and openly the German people on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> were selling that particular soap in bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It looks like it must have been with the help of the Israeli government or the Jewish government, we used to buy that soap out of the <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> , wherever we saw it being sold and eventually, I understand it, that soap went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , it was buried because it was made out of Jewish people’s fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So this was one of my jobs in that particular organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">We also tried to find children, Jewish children that were kept in some <span class="BUILDING">Christian homes</span> and we tried to buy them out from the Christian people to be able to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And we managed to find a lot of Jewish children through certain ways and investigations who had children like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Some Christian, Polish families took in very, very young Jewish children and they kept them as their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Some Christian families did not want to give up their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But a lot of them decided to allow them to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> where they belong and we paid, the Jewish government, the Israeli government paid a certain amount for them as a price for the good deeds that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Later on, I am not going to go into details about what happened when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> attacked, the Polish government attacked our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...
ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the Jewish organization was we had ninety people in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and in the middle of the night they tried to attack, the Polish army tried to attack us, which we resisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We had some guns with us but they decided and not get into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">That <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was closed, it had a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , pretty strong <span class="DLF">gate</span> and they didn’t break the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Somehow they went away and this what happened over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> , and we called on the telephone the Russian military which was stationed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the Russian military told us on the telephone that they don’t interfere with the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">S they didn’t want to help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  When did this incident take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  This incident took place, 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There came an order from, it looks like, you know we were involved with the and other organizations that worked underground from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to bring the people, the Jewish people into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">An order came for us to depart <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittem</span> , start going towards sort of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and we had to go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> we had special papers made for us like new names and the names were given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that lived outside of this particular <span class="BUILDING">building</span> were also taken at the same time so all of us were given Greek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping, going to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the middle of the night, one night, we smuggled the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We had a special guide in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Old and young, were walking through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but we had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So the whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one <span class="DLF">line</span> sort of, it stretched for a long way, we managed to get in to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And we had an assigned <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They took us to that particular <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We came in all muddy with shoes full of mud and wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We had to wash ourselves <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the middle of the night and from there we had to go, the woman from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> took care of us, and we had something to eat and early in the morning they brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not covered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that <span

like from , that was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we started, right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , the older people were lying and they were covered with a canvas, and that’s how they traveled all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> for the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The younger people were assigned to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so being that is a tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , didn’t see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a girl, walked towards the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and we wanted to buy tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">As we went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , two by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many people are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He never had that many people going by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> that he called the police, the Czechoslovakian police, the police came and arrested us. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Naturally we had documents that we were Greeks so we had to, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we spoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the praying book, so sort of this kind of language sort of we spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We didn’t understand each other, but we made believe that we speak Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They arrested us, the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">A Jewish organization in <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> into that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we were going to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They didn’t want us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So we were lucky that they didn’t send us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because we really smuggled out of that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> they organized a group of, about 200 people, to go to the <span class="DLF">border</span> to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">The leadership that was in charge of that group had

<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  The Russian occupation zone of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they let us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> we went to the American side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">Rothschild Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">That was like sort of a place, we organized that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was time to go further towards <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">My uncle Menachim was with me at certain times. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He found me in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">That was my mother’s youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He was in the Russian army and then he was bombarded and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He wound up in certain parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> where he found me accidentally and I was with him at certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Which, if you are interested, later on I will go into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He volunteered during <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> he volunteered to the army and we separated again in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in , In a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> , where he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">All the Zionist organizations had a conference in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and through one person at the conference he found out that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> on the <span class="REGION">American side</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Rothschild Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">That person at the conference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in ; which at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that passes by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> and he’ll wait for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Well, I excused myself from this organization because I was with the Zionist organization going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> all this time, and I said my uncle was there and if you don’t mind I want to travel to meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">That was the first relative I ever found since the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And, as I was traveling, they gave me permission and I was traveling towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He was waiting for me, he didn’t know which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , but he was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was not supposed to stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , only stop there for refueling or something, water. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with Jewish people that were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And as I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> I knew that somebody was going to wait for me at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve, with a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So somehow the Austrian police at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> allowed him to get me off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and take me with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And that’s how I was able to get into this particular camp or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He signed me into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was a little hard because this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did not allow new people to sign into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="514">The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters, relatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> they had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Because there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for newcomers. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He managed to do that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was able to get into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> under the name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that, so I accepted the name Grossman. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn’t want to make complications, so he marked the name Grossman and I became a Grossman which I was a few times before when I met him, and that’s how I am a Grossman all this time it would be too hard to explain to anybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So under Grossman I live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> since I came here.</span></p>

ANSWER:  We’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagorsk</span> and we built that...; it was called in Russian , 1n Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And that’s the railroad that will protect <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> because Stalin decided, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We did and we ran it around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and when Hitler came close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , about twelve kilometers, from one part of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , he probably saw it and he saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> already through his binoculars. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But he never crossed that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> many times was bombarded and destroyed and rebuilt and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was an order by the Russian government to take all these railroad people that were working, hundreds, maybe thousands that were all around <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , excuse me, to ship them, and they were getting ready in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and this must, I don’t remember the time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  I don’t, I can’t recall the time when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> made the . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Maybe in 1942 or the beginning of ’42, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  You passed the winter near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">When I found out that this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and I figure they are pushing, according to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and probably get killed like everybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But I decided to go deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I took a group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovid</span> , from my <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I told them, I said, now we’re not going to work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> anymore, looks like we’re going into some kind of a different uniform and we’re going to have to fight or shoot or something like that, because the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">If you want, I say we should do another thing and go someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Being that we didn’t know where to go, but we decided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we are not needed anymore, in the middle of the night we went from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We were not arrested or kept under special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> they would be suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> that was not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagorsch</span> and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , deeper in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because the Germans were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We found, I particular noticed a transport that was assembled with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Moscow Metro</span> and they were already stationed, they were on <span class="DLF">platforms</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platform beds</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> and those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were hooked up next to these particular <span class="BUILDING">platform station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I said to my friends, I say, look, I don’t know where, but when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> I saw these particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">metro</span> , in the underground, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I think that these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are being evacuated because they are valuable <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , they were very nice and if they are evacuated they are not going to the front they are probably going toward deep into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">If we manage to get on this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we will probably go towards <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , because we did not get information where the transport is going. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took off and went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> , which was north and east. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was cold, so it must have been between °41 and °42, because I froze my hands someplace near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We went into certain, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flatbeds</span> , there were also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> standing on the <span class="DLF">platforms</span> so we managed to get into a <span class="DLF">door</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were traveling in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> in the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> , we found out it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> , we really didn’t know that we’re going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> we saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We were still in the uniform of the railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We had our uniforms on. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We went in to speak to, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , a lot of refugees were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> and they didn’t allow anybody to hook on to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there were wounded soldiers from the front sort of going deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Being that they were wounded soldiers, I didn’t think that these soldiers are going towards the front, they were going to deep into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> for treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn’t allow us to go into the inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> because they were soldiers and we were railroad people, but they allowed us to stay in between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and travel till the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , maybe we’ll find another transport someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We traveled for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I know when I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen traveling in between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and we got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We managed to hook onto some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refugee trains</span> later on in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">When we got into some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there were also refugees from Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from all different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and we managed to get in there with them, travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quebishov</span> , there’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Quebishov</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quebishov</span> they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> , we got off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> , that’s <span class="REGION">Asia</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">On the way we had a lot of trouble because the sanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of sicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> as a railroad guy and as a student for a certain <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in , | made an appointment with the chief of the railroad from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I was lucky enough that he made an appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief, the Kamisar, they call it, and I told him that, I told him a little lie, that we were bombarded o the <span class="DLF">road</span> as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come here and I am looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live and to stay and to work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Well he gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , he told me O.K., you as a machinist, you know mechanics, we’ll give you a job ona machine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don’t have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> except for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> to work on the same machine that was cutting railroad ties for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They would be pushing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> up to the machine by hand and that will be their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">He gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They took us into <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could clean ourselves up and delouse ourselves and we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> for about nine months working on that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Before I got the job, I was sleeping in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> where every morning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They used to clean up the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , they found dead people from typhoid that they used to pick him up and just throw him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">These were all refugees, and I couldn’t live like that, that’s why I went to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> under the name of Gedale Tenenboim. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I worked there for nine months with the machine in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> until my uncle, Menachim came down to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He passed through
