<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Fritz Schnaittacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was Forth, F-O-R-T-H. It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that's about 23 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , about ten kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> , after which we are named, and it had a population of 1,100. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">At the time I was born it might have had ten or fifteen Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">By the time I left, it had dwindled to eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  I need some dates here. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">What year were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I was born in July of 1913 and left -- an interesting part of the development of young Jews at that particular time was that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> only provided elementary education. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">During the first three years of my life, I was in a one room school house which was staffed by a teacher who was Jewish who acted also as a cantor and an insurance agent on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Finally, the small community could no longer afford this teacher, and we were transferred at the third year of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">government school</span> , which was largely a Protestant school, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> also had a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> until it became necessary for the purpose of getting a better education to go to a so called <span class="BUILDING">Pensionat</span> , a glorified <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother, who then had been a war widow, had to give me up Just like she gave up her elder son, my brother Mike, who also went to this Pensionat in order to go from there to a <span class="BUILDING">Realschule</span> , or in my case, ultimately to a commercial high school. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It is interesting to note that because of coming from a <span class="BUILDING">village elementary school</span> , I had to undergo an entrance examination into the then what we considered preferable the <span class="BUILDING">Realschule</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> providing education in languages, math, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But anti-semitism back in 1923 in that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had risen to the extent where the director of the <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> saw fit to transfer me from there to the <span class="BUILDING">commercial high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Life continued as a student and the practice was to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">After graduation, at the age of 17, I went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">wholesale establishment</span> for the sale of household goods and toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">This would have brought us up to the year 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">In these intervening years, Nazism grew, but it did attain the imminent danger of the overthrow of the Weimar Republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The years 1932 indeed seemed to from my memory and as a youngster, seemed to reflect a decrease in the significance of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There was an election in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schleswig-Holstein</span> which indicated for the first time a decrease in the electoral votes that the Nazis got. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">This presented the urgency to Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That changed the situation radically. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor, forms of oppression of terror began to ensue not as yet outwardly against the Jews, but most of all against social democrats and communists, anti- fascist forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In order to give the appointment of Hitler's Chancellor the democratic appearance, the election of March 6, 1933 was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The disunity on the left and the support of the Nazi movement by German nationalists brought about the so-called electoral victory confirming Hitler in the position of Chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Thereafter, really, the efforts began to denude <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of human rights, of civil rights, of democratic rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Now, shall I swing over the time of the arrest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What I would like to ask you 1s prior to this period of time, did you have any trouble with people as a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Did you come from a religious family? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Did you mix well with your German neighbors? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">What was it like before Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  What was social life in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> such as the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or for that matter social life in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Now, I can speak of it from only a very limited point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">As far as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was concerned, after we had left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we hardly -- we only would socialize and to a very limited scale with young people whom we knew to be anti-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The few -- I shouldn't say few, there were quite a few social democrats and those were the only people that we socialized with. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Earlier on, during the years that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> , we would play soccer yet with everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That was until say 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">From then on, the <span class="DLF">lines</span> were beginning to be drawn much more severely. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Now, the question could be raised why would it be called for that a young man who 1s working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and during the week lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> over weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Well, obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My family was not a orthodox Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It practiced traditional Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I at one time through my growing up period had developed a spirit of orthodoxy in deed until I became some sixteen, seventeen years old and I lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I became agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Our social life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> centered around a German Jewish Youth movement which believed in ideas of humanity and yet we were able to enjoy life, until truly the radical changes took place in the beginning of 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Did you experience any abuse or attacks verbal or otherwise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I in the place of business where I worked, I never experienced any acts of anti-semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The place of business was owned by two Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As a matter of fact, particularly one non-Jewish family I was very friendly with. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I considered him to be a devout anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">On the <span class="DLF">street</span> I wouldn't be recognized as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I'm not proud of that, so I did not experience any acts of anti-semitism only when I would become involved in street discussions and they were not infrequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Then sides were being drawn occasionally with violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Once, I do remember one little incident which happened in the moat of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the medieval city is surrounded by moat which was used in those days to play soccer in. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The kids from the <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> , some ten or 13 or us went to the <span class="DLF">moat</span> in order to play soccer when all of a sudden a bunch of rowdies, Nazis, came storming upon us trying to beat us up and I'll never forget one single guy with a hammer and cycle on his cap, I must mention it, a hammer and cycle on his cap he beat them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">These things stand out in one'e memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  When you talk about all of the street discussions, what was the mood? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  The street discussions were between right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The street discussions were prior to the appointment of Hitler as a Chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Thereafter there were no more street discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They were in anticipation of the elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There were several elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the year of 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I did, now that I research my mind, I did experience another rather painful experience in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- 1t used to be a <span class="BUILDING">vacation home</span> for Jewish children, and I was befriended by one of the young social workers in charge of this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there were maybe 30, 40 children, and they had taken a walk to a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I followed them when all of a sudden I was being attacked by a guy from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who was known as a criminal who was on the loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I didn't want to become entangled with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Finally I had to ask for police protection and we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The police visited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">That was in the summer of 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">In order to ask whether we wanted to press charges and we decided not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It was a rather potentially dangerous act. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There were other occasions when Nazis pelted our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with stones, but then in the year 1932 one wasn't hesitant to go after them, but that again that ceased after January 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Were you at all friendly with Christian neighbors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  We had neighbors in a broad sense, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We had some friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Our family had lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for many generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I think you're going back possibly to the early part of the 18th centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Jews only received citizen names in the year 1729 and over the years because we were the family that tried to do well by the poor people, so we had many friends amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  While we're on this, can you tell us a little bit about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I know that you said your mother was widowed and you lived with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">What about the rest of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, my father died as a result of World War I, in 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When he was only 47 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He had not suffered bodily injury, but the service had caused had aggravated his heart condition and he died of a heart attack in 1919 when I was 6 years old and my mother was 31. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My father had two spinster sisters and two or three single brothers no four single brothers who all were living in the two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that we owned visa vie from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He had also a married sister living a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and after my father had died if it 1s of some interest we were --- the family had been in the textile business. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Part of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was devoted to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where we sold piece goods but the men of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> pursued the hop business. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This was the hop- growing section and we went around, my father and my uncles went around to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming villages</span> to buy the hops, and we sulfurized them, baled them and took them to the largest <span class="BUILDING">hop market</span> in the world which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In deed, my mother got the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I think in 1923 or 24. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This describes somewhat the cultural life and existence of Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I had one brother who passed away 23 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Interesting is the fact that my mother, this very courageous woman, took over this textile business and during the years that she didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , drove out by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming village</span> in order to sell from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the piece goods and invite the farmers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in order to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">She was an amazing vital and courageous woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Your brother was he an older brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  My brother was four years older than I am, but he died at a very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He had left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> four years prior than myself, not because of Nazi persecution at that time, but because an uncle of ours had come over in 1900 and had no children of his own, no family of his own, decided to have him join him to ultimately take over his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It was this uncle who then four years later was helping me to come out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  One other question about this period you had mentioned a Youth movement that you were involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Was this political at all or Zionist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, it was not Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">To be sure we were conscious Jews but rainbow colors of political opinions, largely however forward looking, progressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to tell me about your boyhood in either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> or the mood of the times? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Anything else you can remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It sounds like you had a fairly comfortable existence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My family lived in very comfortable circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We weren't rich, but to be sure we were conscious of the very difficult conditions which existed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> economically where you could paper your <span class="DLF">walls</span> with the money that was printed yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and opened <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> like in order to go to a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and buy from the farmer four geese. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That was considered like <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I know it, did my father know it? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So, the farmer loaded the geese on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and covered them with straw, but it wasn't a half an hour later that we heard the shrill whistle of a policeman on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> who could move faster than we did by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">As he drew abreast of us, he forced us to turn around and return the geese to the farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It was however, a week or two weeks later when the farmer drove up to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and delivered the geese. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Somehow he had escaped the attention of the authorities then, but yes, there was hunger in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There was the large scale unemployment which led to the radicalization of the political life. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Were the farmers friendly with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Yes, in the main they were very friendly with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  You said that in 1933, everything started changing very quickly; like what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  The changes in 1933 that I indicated which came about were demonstrated immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The very following day there were demonstrations of stormtroopers along the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I worked and the call went out close your <span class="DLF">windows</span> or we shall shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">On the same <span class="DLF">street</span> there had been the editorial and <span class="BUILDING">printing offices</span> of the social democratic newspaper which had been destroyed on this occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">On top of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> were the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of people that the company that we had been doing business with. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I forgot the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They were wholesalers in textiles, and I took it upon myself to ask the stormtroopers who had been guarding the Social Democratic newspaper in order to visit the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of this particular <span class="BUILDING">company</span> which was owned by Jewish people, and I was greeted with a deep feeling of dismay and despair because their goods were stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Their goods were thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> to stormtroopers who were waiting downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">That was the beginning, only the very beginning of it and you could during the time of the announcement of elections to be held on March 6, 1933, during these short five weeks election rallies of the opposition were prohibited. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, it really began rapidly to spread fear and hopelessness in the circles of the anti-Nazi movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  What were you afraid of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  I was afraid of physical persecution, of being beaten up and the beatings that they rendered were severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">After the --if you were accused of anti-Nazi activities you were likely to be sent to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and after all that didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">On March the 26th, twenty days after the election, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on my weekly weekend visit to my mother, I was settled down and we would have a cup of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My mother had a bad cold, but we were happy to see each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That happiness lasted but a few minutes, and there was a hard knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and there was the gendarme, who said, "Herr Schnaittacher, come with me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I asked why to no avail; no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I had no alternative but to follow him. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">That was in what would have been the purpose of saying no I'm not going with you not without an arrest warrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This is authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I followed him to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , and as we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> he said, "Herr Schnaittacher, you're under arrest." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="144">No answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I said can I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to say goodbye to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I said can I call my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He said here use the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was probably one of the most difficult and painful telephone calls I've had to make in my life.

<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Did they ever tell you why you were arrested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Okay, the charges for my arrested and I insisted and finally they were given to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I was accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government, knowledge of secret ammunition dumps, and liaison man of secret anti-Nazi organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I remotely could have been accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government well it was perfectly legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Thereafter I desisted of any political activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had been an anti-fascist throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My conscience dictated it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">From the moment that I had been arrested, my mother did not rest for a moment, until she succeeded in setting us free. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">That came about through her contact with the Sturmbahnfuhrer and the higher officer of the S.A. who three weeks after we had been in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to look me over and after he saw me in my stocking feet, pants and shirt, he said you don't look too dangerous to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">A week later, the head of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , the prison warden, gave us my cousin and myself the joyful news that we were to be released the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And who was there to release us but my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She really had given me two lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">When the news spread by <span class="DLF">wall</span> Morse code, we had figured out a way of communicating that we were to be released and the answer came back from the two sides of the adjoining south well good for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Leave all the uneaten food behind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So, I was released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">However, with the understanding that I was to report to <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> every other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And as I returned to the place of work where I had been working it had become apparent that rumors had been spreading which only furthered endangered my continued peaceful existence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I had been living and working then. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, then in consultation with my mother and an uncle of mine who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and had his place of business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , we decided that I was to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So, I remember the date, May 1, May 1, 1933 I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and started to work in my uncle's business which was a business selling wholesale glassware and chinaware. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I reported in this capacity to his brokerist, brokerist means general manager. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He had the power of signature. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">His name was Hermannn, and I would like you to remember that name, Hermannn, and I worked there in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> before I started to travel, but I had filed an application to be able to travel and for that purpose I needed to be relieved of having to report to <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> every other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I received a call from my aunt who was in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and she said there is somebody here who wants to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">As I came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , there was a man who stuttered unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was a criminal inspector. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">A criminalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Until, with the stuttering, he brought out the fact that I had filed an application to be released of parole and he was here to grant it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I died a thousand deaths, because I saw now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> looming for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So thereafter I travelled for my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I never returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> I was born because it became apparent that it would be very unsafe. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Indeed, after he visited with my mother she was called by the village council and was told Mrs. Schnaittacher if you had been here yesterday, we would have arrested you. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That was the summer of 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My mother courageous as she was said well, 1f you want to let out your ire on a poor war widow then do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Arrest me now because tomorrow I shall be leaving to visit and stay with my mother who lived then near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I continued to live and work with my uncle until the late fall of 1933 and then probably in the month of September or so I filed for an application for a visitors visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under the subterfuge to sell German products. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So, this visitor's visa and the exit visa from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was granted and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1n the late fall of 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  I just want to ask you a couple of questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  My living and working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was very interesting because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I had wonderful family contact but also working within my uncle's company gave me the opportunity to meet not only Jews but non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I went mountain climbing with one particular man who was an extremely commraderie and friendly and if anything he saved my life when I was about to slip and he helped me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He was by no means singular. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Later on, I started to travel and I made no secret of the fact that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I was not greeted by hostility and indeed I came back with a feeling or came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> later on with a feeling that the laden anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not as significant as I experienced in my first few weeks of the United States of America. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Now, that sounds like an illusion and a terrible accusation, but I experienced here in my early days more direct Jew calling than I did in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I do remember several indecents along a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where young men made remarks which were veiled anti-Nazi remarks. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Of course it didn't last.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , was it starting to get more difficult for Jews even though you had some friends who were not? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Was there a change that affected you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  In the 30s and you probably could extend it to the late 30s almost until the Kristallnacht, even though I can't authoritatively speak for it because I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the fall of '33, but there was the hope on the part of Jewish business people that it was a transient affair, that 1t was a passing affair and business was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">On the other hand, I witnessed, and I will never forget it, young kids being trained in the throwing of hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">These were the future soldiers that invaded Europe, the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And yet, my uncles were very intelligent, very capable businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He took, and I'm going ahead of myself, he took the Kristallnacht and the incarceration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to convince him in spite of my letters to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  In 1933, there weren't yet any restrictions that impacted your movement of your activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Until I left in the fall of 1933, the only restriction as far as my movements were concerned was not to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was a virulent sort of active anti--semitism and my mother and her sisters-in-law and another uncle of mine and his wife and daughters left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The few other Jews remained 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to be picked up after the Kristallnacht never to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  You've mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">What did you know about it at this point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It was new?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  I failed to mention that when I was released on about April 18 or 19th, 1933, there may have been a general amnesty because of Hitler's birthday, but primarily I was released because of the endeavors of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Had I remained in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for some time longer, I would most likely had been transferred to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> which was open just around that time, and whereas it was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> at that time, but it was a camp of terror and torture and this is where the term was first being formed in German of the "auf der Flucht erschossen": Shot while trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">This only got worse with every month and my mother's chauffeur who was an unusually decent guy and a friend of the family was taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">When he got out, after two months, he said, don't ever go provoke or do anything that would get you back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Other people you know being sent there were you hearing about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Wherever two friends whom I didn't know personally but I knew the brother or sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">One, by the name of Goldmann, and the other one, by the name of Minardio, were shot and killed during the month of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was not unusual to find an item in the newspaper shot while attempting to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Let's pick up with your travels to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  How did that come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  In the late fall of 1933, my application for visits to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and selling German merchandise in the United was approved of and I was accompanied by my mother and the uncle for whom I had worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> in order to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Europa</span> , one of the two great German steamers to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> passing the Statue of Liberty never to be forgotten and received by my brother an an uncle and an aunt who had lived here before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Had you made that journey alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  I made the journey by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Did I know any other people aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But I smiled at a pretty American girl and we took a nice picture but I was so young and innocent and there were two German Jewish girls aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> whom I got to know and the trip as such was a joyous affair for me because I was out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and looking forward to a new vital and enormously exciting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">To be sure I was very mindful of the important members of my family, most of all my mother whom I left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But we had an understanding that my mother would be visiting me the next year and now being in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and having the helpful support on the part of my uncle, I started to work 1n his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , knitting fabric for the manufacture of sanitary napkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My uncle was a bachelor who specialized in the manufacture of sanitary napkins and modern mother nursing brassieres. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">What could be more logical. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And early on I became a salesman for him and I learned to speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Then another one of my father's brothers came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to help set up a <span class="BUILDING">distillery</span> for the manufacture of cordials, liqueurs, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norwalk</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and I at the ripe old age of 22 became the first member of the Alcoholic Beverage Salesman's Union, an AFL union, and became the missionary man for this particular company. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Then because it's important -- I'm sorry, I have to bring in another moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had come on a visitor's visa and it was obvious that it was of importance and most desirous to change the status, my status from a visitor to an aspiring citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">At that time, you could not apply for permanent citizen status while living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You had to go abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The system which had developed at that time was either to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> I went to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> and applied for a visa and it was necessary then to come in under the so called quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They had to cable to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in order to receive a quota number and then within approximately 48 or 78 hours, the number arrived and then I emigrated into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as now a potential citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">This was finally confirmed with receiving the citizenship papers in 1939. [</span><span class="sentence" id="272">Break in Tape]
QUESTION:  Was it difficult when you first came over here? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">You had family I know that made it a lot easier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  How was the life of a young immigrant or refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Because there was so many of us, not necessarily as far as total number is concerned to proportion to the number of German Jews who wanted to get our of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had difficulties getting affidavits, getting support, but it wasn't that long that an organization had been founded which concentrated then the influx of German Jewish refugees and provided an enormous emotional support system ultimately to be followed up even with support as far as employment facilities, advice, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">was concemed. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The organization which originally was called the German Jewish club, and then was named New World Club publishes the only German Jewish newspaper and it is still being published under the name of the Aufbau, which is a good paper, an interesting paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We met socially. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We had lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We went on hikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It assisted the integration into the American life enormously primarily emotionally and really in every respect you weren't alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You weren't an isolated being. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">One important point to me which I do wish to mention is then the visit of my mother in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now, she had been taking care of her mother who then was in her late 70s. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">She enjoyed her visit to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> enormously. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Began to dabble in English a little bit and she would have loved to stay but her conscience and sense of duty obviously overruled her own desires and she went back in order to take care of her own mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">This until the other critical, most critical date in the period of after January 30, the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor most critical date is the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Here I would like to mention a few incidences, which I didn't experience personally but which most were authentically reported to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  By your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  By my mother and by my uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">My mother's experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">She lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> which then had not been as virulently anti-semitic as my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , yet during the Kristallnacht, stormtroopers came, smashed their <span class="DLF">windows</span> invaded their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she suffered a severe nervous breakdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My uncles--one living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , the one I had been working for, and the other uncle who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> --they were visited by the Gestapo and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> where they were released. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They suffered enormous physical damage due to closing in the severe winter, severe circulatory problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They were able to survive it and come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the year of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I'd like you to remember again the story of my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> whose name was Hermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The man I had reported to, who, on the morning after the Kristallnacht, stood in front of my uncle's place of business and as my uncle approached he said, "Jews are not allowed here." </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My uncle turned around and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and within hours was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">These stories, these events were told to me after my uncles and my mother came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  How much were you aware living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> or in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> what was going on in the 1930s in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What information did you get either through newspapers or through letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  I was considered myself politically aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I was very much aware of the Spanish Civil War, of the war that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had played. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The role that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , not fascist Italy, had played and the point that I had been trying to make that until 1938 there was still evidently hope on the part of the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that the storm could blow over. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I did not think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In ever so many letters I wrote to my uncles and aunts and finally succeeded first with my mother that there is no alternative but to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">My living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I lived during the years of the deep depression supported however always if need be by my uncle but I didn't need it for myself the income ranging from $13 to $35 to $40 a week was most adequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We lived together with two or three other immigrants, refugees in relative luxury on <span class="DLF">Western Avenue</span> in <span class="DLF">96th Street</span> or <span class="DLF">96th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> between the four or five of us the joined income was probably $80 or $90 in a furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We did largely our own cooking or ate in <span class="BUILDING">cafeterias</span> and weekends we spent hiking was the social life in the organization of Refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Ultimately on the request of my uncle, I changed my position from the liquor salesman to become a member of another company which he controlled which was a company by the name of Acme Cotton Products Company manufacturing surgical dressings and I first worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and then as a salesman and ultimately I became President of the company in the post war period. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That is where I met my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My colleague and next door occupier of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , Ariel Sankon, had a beautiful daughter whom I first saw at the age when she was about 14 and I was of the ripe old -- no she must have been 15 and I was over 22 and I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It took some years later at a Christmas party when she attended she was a student at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> and was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for vacation and after taking another girl <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I said to my wife, today I met the girl I'm going to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">The war clouds became darker, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and the onslaught continued, but fortunately by then we had gotten the rest of my family either to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and finally from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Yes, lam now a U.S. citizen, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I watched the grim developments in Europe with the faint hope that a <span class="REGION">United front</span> could ultimately be shaped with the Russians in order to ward off the total occupation of Europe and to bring fascism to its knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Should I talk about now my involvement in the Army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  How did you get into the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Did you enlist, were you drafted, did you have thoughts of going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> America</span> got into the war on Pearl Harbor day and from then on it was merely a matter of time until I would be drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I was working then in a position of some significance as far as wartime supplies were concerned but that certainly did not outweigh the importance of military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I was drafted shortly after we had gotten married in February of 1942 and I was drafted and sent to Ft. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Dix and from there to basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cancroft</span> , <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> and by the way, with the exception of the camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , Dottie followed me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until we finally had to say our goodbyes when we were shipped abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">From basic training I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">radar training center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steward</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steward</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> , I applied for OCS and went through OCS in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">At that particular time there was a surplus of officers and so I was sent to cooks and <span class="BUILDING">bakers school</span> because the Army travels on its stomach and from there back to <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> and from <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">ordinance training center</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">racetrack</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santadena</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , and from there to <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oakland</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Then near Washington D.C. there was an <span class="BUILDING">intelligence school</span> for topography. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">From there I was sent as a base sensor to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Miles Standish</span> and finally to the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence training center</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Richey</span> , Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Was that something you volunteered for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That's where I was trained in various disciplines of military intelligence from the interrogation of the prisoners of war to further interpretation and various other forms of the type of intelligence information gathered for tacticle purposes at the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Was it assumed that because you were German that this was a good fit for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  I would be inclined to think that that is the very reason that we were selected. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Having been Jewish we were presumed to be beyond any doubt anti-Nazi and a large percentage, I don't know as far as total numbers are concerned, but I'm inclined to believe that a large percentage of LP.W.! </span><span class="sentence" id="337">graduates from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">school of Richey</span> were of German Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Then they seemed to need me in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Richey</span> and the second front second to the Omaha Beach landing was being prepared for the landing in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> on August the 15, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So, we were flown across. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We landed first an unplanned landing on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Azores</span> because we were hit by a lightening bolt, and after that was prepared, we flew on to <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casa Blanca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The following day or two days later we were flown to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">European headquarters</span> were for M.I.S. we were now being reassigned to the divisions that were preparing for the landing into <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Interrogation of Prisoners of War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Before you continue, I want to get a couple facts straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Can you tell me what division and regiment and your rank and all that sort of military --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Well, as far as my rank was concerned, when you become a commissioned officer it's called great. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I was a Second Lieutenant at the time that I joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th National Guard Division of Oklahoma. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The 45th Division was the Oklahoma National Guard Division, one of the most battle tested outfits in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It had a 400 percent, if that 1s claim to fame 400 percent casualty turnover. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was one of three divisions that was used in the attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The 36th and the 3rd and the 45th. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">A division consisted at that time of roughly 20,000 men consisting of three regiments each regiment had three battalion and each battalion had four companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Whether that is different now, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Our specific purposes, and I say our, the I.P.W. specific purpose was to receive prisoners as early as possible out of the chaos of battle in order to get the truth of whatever information they were able to give and it was up to us to discern and as we began to accumulate information from the many, many prisoners that we were able to learn truth from fiction because we knew a lot of the information that they had had and could balance it off and very few because of the tactics we had learned would refuse to provide us with the information we were seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  How did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">What kind of tactics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Rule number one--and you're testing my memory--rule number one was never to ask a question that you could answer with yes or no. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Revealing information that we have had and formulating a question accordingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Speaking to them in the dialect that they were accustomed to because we had sensitive ears and we knew the dialects all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and if we were able to speak we were able to locate them and thereby develop a relationship that created a degree of confidence and willingness to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The morale of the German Army began to be sure once we entered German proper, began to deteriorate rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  One other question and then I want you tell me where you went. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Did you go over there with any trepidation or great eagerness to take this assignment on. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Do you remember what you were feeling at the time when you were just not another American soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  I to the best of my recollection I went with a degree of eagerness because it was one way that I truly could contribute to the effort of destroying Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">To be sure I needed to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I never forget a first attempt, my first attempt to interrogate prisoners and then to report the results of my interrogation to the general in charge of our regiment, who had been accustomed to the battle wise master sergeant, who had furnished him information through many campaigns, from <span class="REGION">Africa</span> or <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> up to , and here he now turns to the brand new chickenshit second lieutenant, he says well Lieutenant what did you learn? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I told him fanciful stories that there of enormous strategic importance and with dismay he turned away from me and says my buddy's name master sergeant was Fritz, he says, "Fritz, what do you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But it changed rapidly and with due modesty I became an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Yet, the most successful interrogation that I had was when I couldn't ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">On March 15, 1945, we had a company of ours had broken through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> into one of the deep enormously strong fortifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My regimental intelligence officer came to me and said, "Lieutenant, this 1s beyond the call of duty, but if you care to, and Fritz we would like you to go up and the company has occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they hear voices on the telephone system but they can't make them out." </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, we did and it was a very active night. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">There was a lot of firing going on, but we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The moment I picked up the received and then relayed the information to my buddy, one sergeant from a German outfit who identified himself and his outfit reported to an officer of another outfit identifying the outfit indicating the route of withdrawal, the next day's <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> , the location of the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> , the <span class="DLF">refueling dump</span> , any question that I could have possibly asked that was of material tactical information was revealed and the following day we were able, not only because of our information but other information that came in to slice totally through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> and advance by some 30 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">That was a proud day. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">From then on, we moved very rapidly and we moved along a <span class="DLF">line</span> that could hardly have been designed any better had I volunteered or had I been asked because of my personal knowledge of <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">The first such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we occupied that we conquered, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aschaffenburg</span> , where an aunt of mine had left prior to the war and had married my favorite uncle, and I was to their wedding in 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Indeed, my buddy and I took on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> -- no let me clarify something. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Under the command my buddy and I under the command of Colonel O'Brien we accepted as interpreters the surrender of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aschaffenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We then took the commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aschaffenburg</span> , who the day before had strung up several officers who had wanted to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We put them on the front of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and he drove with us into <span class="REGION">areas</span> that had not been occupied yet by our troops, and then we were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He said, put your arms down and they had one American prisoner to whom he gave a gun, and we disarmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They disarmed voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">A platoon of at least 30 or 40 men and this one American soldier, G.I. with a German rifle marched this unit back to the American P.W. cage. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We moved quickly and other points of interest were only days later when I had a group of six prisoners in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">One of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together?" </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I picked up his helmet and I said "By God, Leslach, we did." </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I have a picture still here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a class picture of 1929 or 1928 with a picture of Leslach. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">He had been a decent guy and he said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I love my wife so much." </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I said, "I love mine too, but I can't let you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The next day, we took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medieval town</span> with a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> had suffered little damage and in the <span class="DLF">church yard</span> we had some 800 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It would have been a vain effort to interrogate anybody specifically because militarily speaking we had more information than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was a pure coincidence that one out of these 800 stepped up to me and said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I come from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I said, "My, where are you from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="399">and he said, "Forth, F-O-R-T-H." This is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born, where I knew every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and <span class="BUILDING">house</span> number and every <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And it seemed to me that I had known every person. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So, I said to him, "But you weren't born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He said, "No, I wasn't." </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I said "How come that you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="404">Because I married a girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="405">Whom did you marry?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="406">Gunta Haas." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Gunta Haas was a year or two years younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I had known her. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I said, "Gunta Haas, she lived in <span class="BUILDING">House number 35</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We lived in <span class="BUILDING">House number 52</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He said yes, <span class="BUILDING">house number 35</span> is two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> removed from the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant ministers house</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span> , two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from the little <span class="BUILDING">fire house</span> and his pupils grew wider and wider and he said "If American Intelligence has all this information, how can we win the war?" </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So, now you know how we won the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">A few days later, and I'll never forget that date, Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We were outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> and on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> after which my family is named. </span><span class="sentence" id="416"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> had no more Jews of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was the seat of the only <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in a large area of <span class="REGION">central Franconia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It's oldest <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> went back, so I'm told went back to the 14th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">My father and uncles and grandfathers, etc, grandmothers, are buried there in the new <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">While we were still recetving German artillery directed towards us, the occupiers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> I visited my <span class="DLF">father's grave</span> and I never forget as I was standing there in deep deep thought and sorrow, somebody came up to me and said what are you doing there and I said, "My name is Schnaittacher." </span><span class="sentence" id="421">That little story seemed to have traveled to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We didn't conquer my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">It was occupied by a sister regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">From there we went to the conquered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I interrogated the fortress commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I had known him. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I had no particular coincidences relating to my past having lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> while occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We moved on across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and approached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  What information, you knew of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> from when you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but how much did you know of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  At this point we had very little information about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We had liberated, but I forgot the name of a small camp which was neither extermination or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">torture camp</span> where we saw emaciated human beings suffering from all kinds of sicknesses, stacked up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> with little care. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">That was no preparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We had no information on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But I knew from past knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as a camp of torture and destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> my <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> in the late afternoon, or afternoon and I was asked to go to the <span class="BUILDING">camp headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Approaching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in front of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was one of these infamous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The likes of which I had never seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> was filled with corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Men and women who according to what we were told possibly might have been transported from the east to the west as the juggernaut. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And, with no food, little clothing, most of them died of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Those who tried to climb over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were shot by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Yet, I couldn't resist a feeling that when a few minutes later, I saw the living cadavers the dead ones were more peaceful than the living ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The living skeletons their beaming ravaging eyes, the torment that was obvious that they had suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The endless torment. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I didn't get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> otherwise to visit the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I passed an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> but I had no time for any personal inspection because I had to interrogate an SS Brigadefuhrer, an SS brigadier general who I first had been introduced to him or it was mentioned to me that he was someone to give us information and he was friendly and I think I shook hands with him, and later on I felt that my hand would shrivel up. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Now, he claimed that he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> on an arrest and recuperation leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That he had become a member of the SS against his wishes, yet he was grateful for it because he could give personal testimony personal witness as to the crimes that had been committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">One thing which I never forget was you should not be enraged as to what you see here. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Here you see little heaps in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kattowice</span> , you would have seen mountains of dead people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  This is what he said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">According to my buddy Fritzie who was involved much longer than I was in the War Crimes Trial, I believe he was hung as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I had asked you to remember the date of May 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It is the end of my story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I went back to <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> and the very next day or morning we moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We then began to experience some hopeful signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The underground anti-Nazis tried to make contact with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I come back again to May 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> on May 1, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">My division conquered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> on May 1, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I do think that it might be interesting to mention a few personal experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">As soon as I did not have a regimental obligations I tried to clear up or redeem one event. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I had asked you to remember the name Hermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I had worked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He was my immediate boss and he was the one who prevented my uncle from entering his place of business and ultimately to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">As soon as I was able to, I went to my uncle's place of business, which had been bombed out, and I asked about Hermann and I was able to locate where he was living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Having the ability to use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , not to drive it, I had a driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">By then I was a first lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I drove out to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I asked people and at that time gleefully as long as they weren't involved the Germans pointed at others, and so I arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where Hermannn was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He was dressed 1n his stocking feet and pants and underwear and long johns and I said, in very harsh German, "Go and get dressed, and come with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">His wife wailed and so did his daughter, but I could be heartless, and I loaded him on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where I took advantage of the friendly offer that was made by the counterintelligence and interrogated Hermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">As I mentioned or didn't mention, in accordance pursuant to army instructions and regulations would have been to go through channels, but I had no time for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Fortunately for me, in the course of the interrogation, he revealed that he was a guard at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which made him subject to automatic arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">After I concluded my interrogation, I introduced myself to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I told him who I was and he said "But you, Herr Schnaittacher, should know how good I was to your uncle." </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And I said "Yes, I certainly do." </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Tape #3
ANSWER:  My stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> gave me the opportunity also to meet the friend of the family, and that was a very joyous occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">She had been working as the housekeeper for my aunt and she was overjoyed to see me and overjoyed about the end of the oppressive system. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Another somewhat humorous experience reflecting upon some key reporters was the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My division commander had learned that I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> prior to the war, and so I was ordered to come to him and he said Schnaittacher I understand you had lived here before. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We are expecting a bunch of newspaper men, congressmen senators, all kinds of bigwigs that want to see the birthplace of Nazism and I want you to be their guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So I took this group on the trip and I started with the <span class="DLF">Odeonsplatz</span> , which is the square where the Putsch had taken place in 1923 which had failed, and the legend went that courageous Hitler as firing started quickly left his troops and hid behind one of two statues and one of these key reporters profoundly thought so nothing more important to ask behind which one. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">The other little story goes to the <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> where the Putsch had started in 1923 and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> there was an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> which was filled to some degree with stuff which had been stolen from <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Amongst them was a statue of a storm trooper standing on a swastika with a German eagle and the other key reporter raised the statue and said, "Did this come from a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> , too?" </span><span class="sentence" id="487">This I could only laugh at. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">My stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was then a brief one. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Thereafter, I was assigned to a camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigsburg</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American P.W. camp</span> of so called automatic arrests. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">This was a very wise law that Eisenhower had released early after combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Classifications of people would be subject to automatic arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Nothing noteworthy happened other than one general who revealed something that I had had no idea of that they were working on the ultimate secret weapon but I didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Then after a brief rest in a rest area, I was transferred to the War Crimes Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  When was this, what month?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  I would say that should have been, could have been in July of 1945, and I was in charge of a detail that was screening the archives of the German army high command in pursuing the case of Hjalmar Schacht, the economic czar of Hitler's. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I must say that we did not find any important evidence of his involvement in war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Not of any national significance but a totally inhuman story was contained in a letter that I came across from a youngster who very proudly reports to someone in his family that on his 13th or 14th birthday his father gave him a rifle and three Jewish prisoners to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Inhumanity beyond description. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We could not make use of it as evidence in pursuing this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  Why couldn't you use that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Because we were not able to identify the people involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This period where I had a good deal of free time, and possibly I skipped a few months, I should go back to the month of June when I had the first opportunity to visit my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Again, I had the privilege of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and a buddy of mine, because my driving left much to be desired. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I learned how to drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> on some desert exercises where we had no <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">As dusk began to settle we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and I can still see shutters opened and I hear the sound "Fritz is back, Fritz 1s back, Fritz is back." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was born in, and we drive up to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> hadn't changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Downstairs had been converted into the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's office</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">party's office</span> , but the upstairs were <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and fearfully a young woman looks out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> where my mother used to sleep and I could hear her knees shaking because those were the days when an American knock caused fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I didn't recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">She was too young, and I asked her to send her father down. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Her father came, and I recognized him at once and he fell around me because he recognized me inspite of my uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He had been an old Social Democrat, a very decent human being, a decent anti-Nazi and I said you can stay in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but tonight we want to sleep here. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But now I want to visit the driver of my mother who in my memory had taken on the role of a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He protected my mother wherever possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He suffered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and I wanted to know whether he had come back from the war and whether there is anything I could do for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We drive up to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but he hadn't returned yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He had I believe still a prisoner of war, but we left some gifts with his wife, who was deliriously happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">As we drove back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and now again I close a cycle who was there to greet me? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The very gendarme who had arrested me in 1933, plus another man. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Both of them wanted to shake my hands but their hands are still sticking in the darkness of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But I ordered the gendarme to report to me the following morning that I needed him for certain steps that I wanted to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">In one of our <span class="INT_SPACE">back rooms</span> of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I then asked him to bring to me the mayor and again I went beyond army authority and that was being held against me and I had him. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We had town criers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I ordered him to tell the town crier to return to the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's office</span> all stolen Jewish property. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Thereafter, I told the gendarme I want him back in about three or four hours because I wanted to drive to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> in order to set things straight there because grave stones had been thrown over, destroyed, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's office</span> , who at first was reluctant to cooperate but when I touched my sidearm, he said yes I will do it, I will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">In order to restore to whatever extent possible the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Then I drove back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">This is Fritz's war, and I ordered the apprehension of the guy who had been responsible for sending the remaining Jews after the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I think his name was Britting (ph), and ordered him to be brought to me and I took him again without authority to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and turned him over to the C.I.C. Subsequently some months later I was ordered to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> because I received a decoration and after that I passed an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where the friend of mine who had become a major I believe and he took me into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said you've got to watch your step, you went out of channel. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Where did I go out of channel? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">By ordering the mayor to do things and by apprehending whom I considered to be a criminal and by ordering the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span> to restore the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So, I said, "Who's complaining about it?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="536">The town major of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erlangen</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="537"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erlangen</span> , where I had been in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , so I said, "On my next trip, I will see the town major." </span><span class="sentence" id="538">and indeed I did and I said Major this isn't the first time I was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erlangen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I had been in prisoner here in 1933 but if you wish to imprison me feel free to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Well, he was embarrassed and then he tried to get information from me, but I used this opportunity to then go to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the same warden was still alive and he said, Herr Schnaittacher, now the ones who imprisoned you are imprisoned here." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Well, another cycle is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Now, back to the War Crimes Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">The greatest satisfaction I had was when I was called in to act as interpreter for an integration carried out by I think a Colonel Gershon (ph) of Field Marshall Keitel, the chief of staff of all of the German armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I certainly felt a great deal of satisfaction when I entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that he stood up and stood at attention and saluted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Can I think for a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I don't know if there was anything else worth mentioning of my tour of duty with the War Crimes Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  What else were you doing with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  We were going through the archives document by document, and I had a group of translators that was in pursuit of it was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The War Crimes Trials took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> but it took place outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fechenheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  And you were looking mostly for Schacht evidence --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Only that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Did you come up with anything else that became useful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  No, not that I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  How many months did you work with the War Crimes Commission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Let me think now. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">At most it was probably not more than two. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I'm trying to think, maybe three because in October the return trip started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I guess I could close with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  I have a few questions for you if you feel that you have covered the war crimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Yes, it's disappointing little because I don't have any recollection of any documents due to the specialization of our search.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Were there certain difficulties or obstacles you faced in trying to --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  No, no because in the archives if anything it was lack of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Well, I want to go back to the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I know that that 45th did in fact go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Were you part of the first group that went in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  I was part of the -- I can say that I was in --I must explain a little bit about the order of battle so to speak, the system of battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You have the advance unit of infantry men commanded by lieutenants or captains. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Usually there is a lieutenant in charge of a platoon and a captain in charge of a company. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They are the real heros in my opinion because they day by day are exposed to not only artillery fire but small arms fire and the physical danger which we were exposed to a much less degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I was with <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">My buddy Fritzie had gone somewhat earlier because I was ordered to stay back at <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> and I think he interrogated the wife of General Paulus, the general who was in command of the German army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> I was ordered to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="BUILDING">camp headquarters</span> which was in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I still heard firing but it was no longer an intense firing that we saw in the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I'm inclined to believe anyhow with the approach of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> that the SS took off as fast as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Who was doing the firing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  I could not identify, but I would be inclined to think that it was our men who did the firing. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Any German being killed because of the rage that was in our troops I wouldn't doubt it for one moment because one could only feel the deepest of rage and hatred for what human beings could do to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  You didn't see it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  I didn't witness it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  What about retaliation by the prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  I saw one incident as I was in the process of entering which I interpreted to be the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> or one of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and a large group of prisoners seemed to want to tear a guy to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My false humanity showed itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I tried to stop but I didn't persist. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It was not a very pleasant sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">It was an obviously disturbing and in retrospect and even then I could understand how valid and justified for what these people had gone through for years and years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  What were they doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  Trying to tear him to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Was he a guard a Kapo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  I had no idea what he had been whether he was a guard a Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I had no idea what he had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">By the time I got through with the interrogation of this SS brigadier general night had set in and it was dark and I headed right back to <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> and early the following morning we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  Were there a number of SS guards still there that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  No, I didn't see anymore guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  What can you estimate when you saw those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> coming in how many of them there were or how many people you saw only corpses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  The figure that sticks in my memory 1s anywhere between six to eight hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I didn't count the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I went along side them and I saw the horrible sights. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Some of them were trying to eat each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">There was such terrible terrible hunger and then primarily what I seem to be impressed with was that then suddenly life ebbed out the precision of the corpses seemed to tell this as a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">They succumbed in so many different <span class="NPIP">positions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They succumbed to weakness. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They succumbed to the end of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  But at the time you were walking by there was still some sort of alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I didn't see any more that there was movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  I thought you said something about they're eating each other?</span></p>
