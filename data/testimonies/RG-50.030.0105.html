<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My maiden name was Weissmann so I still carry it as Gerda Weissmann Klein.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born on May 8th, 1924 in the most southern western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> in German and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielsko</span> in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It went by both names and it was in the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salasia</span> (ph) at the foothill of the <span class="DLF">mountain range</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Would you tell me about your parents and about your family as a young girl, as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Well, in in retrospect, my parents seem absolutely saintly and everything seems just marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I know it couldn't possibly be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I know it must have rained at times but my my memory 1s uh is very vivid and I I cherish it very much and I don't see why I should change this perfection which I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh, I had one older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was five years older than I. His name was Arthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My parents name were Julius, Julius and Helena Weissman. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh we lived in in in an old large <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a hugh <span class="DLF">garden</span> with many fruit trees and flowers, a wonderful thing for children to roam in. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had ten cats, all black. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I knew all their names and uh now, you know, my children know, my grandchildren are used to me to recite the names of my cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My brother had two dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh I used to love swimming in summer and skiing in winter and uh by and large I I had a marvelous childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Uh I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> first and then but only until the war broke out to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Notre Dame</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was a <span class="BUILDING">private girls school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">However we had the rabbi coming giving us Jewish instructions, so it was about uh I would say a quarter of of the girls in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in my class, were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And that was the natural thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I uh I really liked <span class="BUILDING">school</span> very much even though I pretended I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh and of course, you know, when the war came that was the end of my formal education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Well, I guess the danger signals were flying very high in uh in the summer of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh by and large I must say it was ignored by my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh I was away with my mother in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krinitza</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh I even remember my my very first uh incident which inspired a great deal of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother and I went to a concert and I remember the setting quite vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh there were flowers around. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I'm not very musical but uh that summer something caught on that day and I remember uh the crowd of people sitting there and and flowers and it was very warm, uh a day of...you know, one of the golden days of of summer, as I see it now, and suddenly a young man came running up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and he pushed the conductor aside and he said, how can you all sit here listening to music when danger is coming from there, and he pointed to to the â€”_ which separated us from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which already had been occupied by the Nazis and and he said monsters are coming from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Why don't you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and take up arms and join...I remember moving closer to my mother and and saying shouldn't we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and uh but pretty soon police came and uh arrested the man because he was an agitator for disturbing the peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I I I still remember that that sudden fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That that really was my my first memory of uh of something impending but we stayed perhaps another week. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I don't remember exactly how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">However, on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we saw at <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> an awful lot of baggage which was labeled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Apparently people were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh my father had his arm in a sling and my mother naturally was terribly concerned and uh apparently he had suffered a slight heart attack and uh unfortunately and since things were moving very fast, uh that must have been perhaps the third week in August...that we received a telegram from my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My mother had a brother...my mother only had one brother and he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and uh he sent us a telegram saying that we should get out, that we had visas which were in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , but my mother said uh we're not going to tell Poppa about the telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Poppa is ill (ph) and he should not be disturbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I guess that __ my family, and I only hope and pray that my mother really didn't fully realize that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Tell us just what happened next. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What did you do once you realized...
ANSWER:  Well, uh it was Friday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I I I remember it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was fifteen you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was Friday morning when we heard a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and people ran into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and uh and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and we ran out and saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> with the swastika flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was terribly exciting and and a lot of activities started then. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They were building <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and uh and you know, uh my mother tried to keep sort of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> down, were closed so from my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> ...my father was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My father was quite ill and that night uh there were lots of of refugees on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">You know, people running away and and there was was shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I remember one one man was carrying a goat on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Apparently it was his only possession, a small goat and people with wheelbarrows and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family called and said that they are going to flee into the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and suggested that they would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my brother's decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was, you know, considered too young to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My brother was nineteen at the time and my brother said no, we we're not going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We will stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You you'll need us. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father was ill, and and that was a terrible shock because, you know, my father to me was sort of the center of my universe. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I mean, you know, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should suddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there was no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it was like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that I remembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer whatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And it was a wonderful Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Everything was cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There was...we had no electricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and my parents were sort of joking. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all sitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then in the evening they start with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back he he had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The Germans were coming but we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with some other people, you know, and it was morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember most vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She had prepared some breakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> with Nazis in it, two...one in the side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just taken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his hand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I remember everybody just sat there totally stunned and then we heard people uh running. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There were more more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw from from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> the black swastika flag and I think that was the most enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our friends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know, you can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the things uh it sort of changed suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember uh the coal fell out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cradle</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and no one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset my mother was and no one paid any attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">These were just tiny little vignettes which suddenly sort of you know changed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you know, then more and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more hoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and II saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white roses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for and the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother dragged me on the carpet and he said, keep quiet, you know, you you can't do that, and he took me up to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he said, you know, don't make a sound and it was in the after...it was in the morning...I mean, you know, uh the whole day was sort of uh melange (ph) of many many feelings which I try to remember over the years, but one of of the worst things happened that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she blessedly is alive and she lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...her name is Esther Bergman (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Her mother came and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill but she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because they had rounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and they set the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> aflame and then she sort of went out by the <span class="DLF">back door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I think that was truly the first impact what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  What happened over the next few days? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">How did uh things ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I couldn't you tell you day by day, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh people came. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Our our neighbors came, our non-Jewish neighbors came...oh, one thing, yes...uh a neighbor who, you know...she...the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in which we lived in not only was I and my brother born there but my mother had been born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was a <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> , you know, and our grandmother had lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Fortunately, blessedly for her, she died the year before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She, you know, never faced that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Uh a woman came and she asked where our flag was, the Polish flag, you know, which used to be red and white, and uh my mother said why, and she said we have to make a German flag out of 1t and my mother pretended to look for it in all <span class="NPIP">places</span> where she knew she wouldn't find it, you know, and then uh the woman left and she said she would be back later. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Maybe my father can help look for it, and I think that became very clear that we better produce it because she really wanted it for our protection and she said all you have to do is, you know, keep the the red flag and cut a round circle from the white, put a black swastika on it and she came to collect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She did it and then she said she wanted to look where Arthur was because he is very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He should hang it up and he apparently could not be found to do it, so the woman struggled to hang the flag up and she sort of said to my mother, you know, if uh if the flag is not displayed from here, it would be pretty obvious who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And uh I remember we couldn't look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> to see to see that flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We had some other people you know living in in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as well who uh who were not Jewish and some were sympathizers and of course they wanted that, because you know, this was the part which was German speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="93"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielitz</span> before the war was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and later on it was also one of the first things that became uh it was they called it , you know, , uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , which was _____, and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Of course it wasn't, you know, but we immediately became uh under the symbols as as <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So uh the people who...I suppose most people were German-speaking people, you see, and people were shouting uh heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Thank you for the liberation, and things like that because they thought that you're not an Austrian Empire was coming back with, you know, Franz Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elizabeth and so on, you know, was the part had been under <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for only twenty years, so uh uh I think there was a lot of mis...perhaps misguided feeling on behalf of the people, maybe not so much pro-Nazi at that particular point, but of course all that changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Over the next few months, what happened to you and your family and how did things change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men between I think sixteen and fifty had to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My father at that point was about fifty and since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My brother was nineteen and, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> declared war, you know, that we knew right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">That happened Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You know, we were occupied Sunday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Sunday afternoon uh <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">David was about my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they were going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor battalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The date was the 19th of October on which my brother left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused to make his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="109">Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We didn't hear from my brother for a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he was uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was in . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And what apparently happened was that uh they were brought into the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> uh nearthe __.....] don't know exactly what <span class="NPIP">location</span> ...pursued by bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Those who were good swimmers swam across. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , which was uh occupied by the Russians and he worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh my brother was was trained in chemistry uh and he worked in some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> making germ (ph) or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh that was one of the greatest, marvelous moments in the bleakness of our existence to to hear that Arthur was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Uh I cannot...I really...1 mean I was sort of refreshing my memory and looking at some of the things which I had written after the war which I have the most clear knowledge as far as dates are concerned but I know that uh it probably was a few months later that we were to move into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was very wet there and there was no electricity there and uh my father's uh condition deteriorated quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He suddenly looked very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Uh my mother uh who up to that point you see, because my grand...we had lived with my grandmother and so I was rather pampered and you know, uh given to be very easily discouraged and upset about uh little things like uh you know, table clothes didn't iron properly, or the lace was wrong or something...uh showed incredible strength and fortitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">As a matter of fact she was the one who did not cry when my brother left. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And my father wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The first time I saw my father crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was sort of reversal of of roles you see and I think to to me a very devastating thing to see my father helpless and and I never saw my father helpless before and uh so we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh I learned new skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I saw my mother uh bringing an old...it was called petroleum lampiere (ph), you know...uh lamp....I learned to clean the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> of the lamp and if we got some guests to to make illumination like that, because we had no light. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Uh pretty soon of course, you know, uh we exhausted our funds because we we had no no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You know, everything was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My father didn't earn anything and all those things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were vegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... hada _â€”_â€”_â€”Â«, you know, a nanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she would go and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful needlewoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through that we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't particularly interested in that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I was more of a tomboy running around with cats and climbing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My mother really had a wonderful reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You know, she would embroider things on sweaters. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often because petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration card...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to eat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow and my father would sit and read to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And really this is how uh my father was wonderful..you see, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Even so, my first language was German...spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and when I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I would switch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I spoke it naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was my first language. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching me to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and we would let the candle go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Then we would take take some wax and my mother made uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We would get uh thirty . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Well, it was thirty if you could buy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , so I would say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we would able to buy roughly a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And this is how things went. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then started the things of the , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was uh to be sent away and every so often a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> would come announcing that...as a matter of fact the first one came uh when we had not heard from Arthur, and I remember at that point my my mother sort of must have suffered a nervous breakdown, at least a momentary lapse because I remember she was she was totally out of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She was calling for Arthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And my father was up with her and my father told me to go and to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We we were supposed to leave with twenty pounds of our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And uh my father bought for us sort of _ little suitcases and he told me to to pack some things and and word got around to uh in the community that we were selling things. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Everybody...I mean all the Jews..that was the way to do it, and people started to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My father said whatever anybody gives you, take it, and he stayed with my mother, and then uh word got around that if...I don't remember the exact amount...let's say uh kilo gold...something like that...1t might have been less, it might been more. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">If that would be given and then that would stay , So you know, everybody scurried to get whatever jewelry people had to bring it...of course that was another...was what the Germans did in order to to get the valuables which people were holding and . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And apparently they got what uh whatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and again I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother seemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would say until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You know, looking back now, my mother was a very young woman at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She was she was forty-one when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen year old girl, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My father was ten years older than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So the existence, you know, and worse and thisis show we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">This was three years...1939 through the spring of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps when the order came that we had to move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> which was the shabby, remote part of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually in you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielitz-</span> it's called now, two , twin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and that we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielitz</span> and that was and way out. ___, </span><span class="sentence" id="168">near a very old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where we had to to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And uh as I told you, my my <span class="DLF">garden</span> hold held most of my wonderful childhood memories and uh fairly soon...I would say probably in early 1940, uh there was a sign on it that no Jews or dogs were permitted in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , so we naturally did not go but on the morning on which we were forced to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I jumped over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and went to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and I ran around. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Uh I remember there were the first violets where we had a little brook... , the first violets were there, which I had picked and I remember sort of planting a branch of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> where I used to sit and pretending what it would be like if if nothing had happened you know and I would go in and my parents would be at breakfast and my brother would be going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so on, and uh you know, even so uh I always firmly believed that I'll go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That became the crutch through all the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Looking back now I realize that I must have had a premonition because I remember in that I sort of really started imagining what my <span class="DLF">garden</span> would look in all seasons, and I knew that I would not see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But I don't know any longer if I thought that I'll never see it for a period of time or if there would be finality in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I I really don't know. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, strange as it may seem, I guess I really was happier in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> than at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I had friends there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was uh...well, that isn't quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My my father, you know, there were several girls, particularly the one who became tremendously close to me, my friend Elsa (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There was Esther Bergman who lived not too far away and she used to come, but my father would teach us and that was still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You know, he would take books out and teach us a bit of history and all those things that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He was very knowledgeable so, you know, in a very fragmented way, but I think uh in those first three years, almost three years at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was my father...I I think I I acquired quite a bit of knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He taught me all...my father my father was supposed to be a rabbi and because you know he came from...you see my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> which was uh very Austrian and they prided themselves, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still celebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the 18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all talked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to think the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called and _____ was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> of the which was he was very well know. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">As a matter of fact even now I read quite a bit...his name was Freidman (ph) and my father's family was related to him and I have some wonderful childhood memories as a child going to . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Uh should I have continued with with what I talked before...do you wish me to...

ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then the order that my father's leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There is however one thing that I would like to mention as a tribute to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Uh the last night before my father left...of course we all lived in one large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at that point...I heard my parents talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I don't know if it was for them or for my benefit. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They did not mention at all the parting in the morning, but they spoke about their years together. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were, you know, about about the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the hopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which which has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the of the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in subsequent times, it uh it was a very comforting thing and I shall always be grateful for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I mentioned seeing my father for the last time and after that, my friend who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now, uh and I went...we knew...see, they were taking all the men on Sunday and uh took place on Monday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Uh we decided, uh and I, that we should, we we knew what's going to happen to to all the books, probably prayer books and most of the books which were in Jewish families that were treasured and uh after my father was taken away, we went and collected all the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was afraid that the Germans are going to use it for unspeakable purposes and we dragged it to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> which was really the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and uh we buried them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I'm sorry for not understanding my mother's grief completely at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You know, I was really terribly close to my father and that I didn't comfort my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Today I think I sort of needed to be alone, to lick my own wounds, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Uh there's just one more thing that I want to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Before my father left, he asked me (pause)...
QUESTION:  It's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
ANSWER:  And my father said that uh...I'll always remember that one does not carry one's calling card in one's pocket, engraved upon one's ___...(Pause) (Crying) (Pause)...anyway I'm sure that many people have given you descriptions of of the leaving one uh of leaving and I guess our's was not too much different. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Except that my mother decided to fast on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It was a Monday, and my mother fasted every Monday since my brother had left, and uh she had a bit of precious cocoa she had hoarded throughout the entire war for a special celebration and she made some cocoa for me that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I must say it did not taste very sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We were marched through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> under the whips of the SS uh to a certain collection...I had it happen to me many times during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Later on that one sees sort of in rapid succession the things which you see as a thing which 1s a hoax (ph), like uh they were putting a new name of a movie on the marquee, uh watching by a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my mother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You know, it was such a...and yet it's very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I remember it in .

<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Tell me, tell us a little bit about that...
ANSWER:  . (</span><span class="sentence" id="273">Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go outofthe _ to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was...there were two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and uh I mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">His name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he __ with his family that you see you could get out of the â€” if you uh had a place of work, if you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two sisters and they had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and they were willing to put one in a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to secure a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, which was an incredible sacrifice. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh however I knew that if I did that I would probably have to marry __. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I made the decision not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Uh maybe this is a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even though I knew I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man inthe ||| whocame and told me that I was able to go out...his name 1s Jacob Chancer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where of course I lived for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That decision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs (ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And you see uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> , my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , was renown for its textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Uh it was called of <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> you hail from (ph), and industrialists from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would come to buy slaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">A man by the name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller from a firm called . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh textile-oriented and associated firms and they needed people to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">When he came and he saw that x number of girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> were there, for some reason he thought we might have more ex in weaving or whatever and anyway they were always looking because you see that still fairly early. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That was '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They needed German speaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenhein</span> (ph) which was a new weaving camp in . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And in fact this is where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">In all fairness I must say that uh that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was probably better than than most of certainly what followed because it was new. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You see, we were only fifty girls there. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And the person who became our lager fuhrer, at first sight she looked like a bulldog and I thought she's going to tear us limb from limb, and she was a very kind person. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">She was probably chosen for her looks but we all who were in captivity under her owe her a debt of gratitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I think by her very decency she pinned a lie to the lips of all who said they had no choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I won't say she particularly loved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">She saved my life once for which I'll be eternally grateful and there was uh as far as I know and I do know, that as long as we were there and later in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> (ph) where she also was, nobody was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from those two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And uh she showed that people could help individually and she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I only met during my entire years under the Nazis, for six years, I only met two who were really kind and I think that they should be singled out for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Frau...her name was Frau Keegler (ph), with an umlaut, so uh and we first saw her and she barked and everything...I thought this is the end of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Well we...I was with my friend Yelda (ph) whom I really would like to mention and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there we became as close as sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Yelda was a childhood friend only in the sense that her mother and my mother were friends, you know, but Yelda played the piano beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She was exquisitely mannered. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My mother always told me how how I should try to be more like Yelda, you know, and of course I hated to play with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She seemed to be the paragon of all virtue, and uh we became quite close already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when we used to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> ...1t was the only place you could go, but uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you see she had a little sister by the name of Kitty and of course Kitty was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">My other friend Gretle (ph) had a sister, so the two sisters...you know, everybody sort of had a buddy and Yelda and I became that to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">She she showed great promises as a pianist. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">She was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> uh two years before the war to study at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> there and uh a great future was predicted for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And Yelda sort of became my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">As a matter of fact, we looked quite a bit alike and uh so it was and there was something else that uh perhaps would give you sort of an inkling what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkhain</span> , I met a wonderful girl, a vivid redhead, a wonderful, you know, called beautiful people, tall, wonderful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Her name was Suzie Kunz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> but her mother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> were mostly girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and you know we were all German speaking and this is why we went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I was standing next to Suzie on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You know, the it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sort of uh...there was a certain freedom there you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We were in...not confined at the

class="sentence" id="320">And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year, and Suzie said no, we're not going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I said I'll bet you and she said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">She said let's bet a quart of strawberries and a quart of whipped cream and we shook hands on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And Suzie died on liberation morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I found her dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don't know if she knew or if she didn't...she won that bet. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Anyway we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span> ...you know uh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing should be said...actually for me it it was easier then. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Easier in terms that I didn't see my parents suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced that my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I pushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't worried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And you know, I know if somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">All the indignities that one has suffered and you know and vice versa, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But of course when you're eighteen years old you know, you have the ___ that you don't...anyway uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span> was rough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There was somebody there by the name of Meister Zimmer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He was dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And uh I used to amuse myself when he told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the things, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were designed to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these things we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he would look like when he was dead and things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Uh now I...I...you know, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like that and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to remove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But you know, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do which are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...1t's funny...I lapse into German now...uh to tie something, a knot, you know, a weaver's knot to be exact, and you had to do x number a minute and of course you can imagine when you have somebody standing with a stopwatch above you to do that uh your life __ on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But for some reason most of us were able to do it and those who were not were put in the spinner _ or in other things, so nobody was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from the original fifty there. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And it was by comparison of what came later, relatively easy in as much...I mean we were not that hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We we got some food because Mrs. Keegler was decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Uh we uh we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> long hours and I think that was really the very best thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were so exhausted at the end of the day that you had to concentrate so much and to work, you know, that your mind couldn't absorb what...
QUESTION:  I think at this point we need to pause. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We will change tapes and that will give you a chance to..... End of tape #1 Tape #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We are back on tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You were telling me about uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the weaving...
ANSWER:  The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler was quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how often you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to, but I was fortunate that I had my father's address in s+ which way my father was allegedly working on the fortification of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and uh I wrote to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Uh I did not hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me letters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was, those packages did arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father and one day a most incredible thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and she called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the letter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Uh I think that we needn't go into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day and a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I I could not utter a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was uh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across 1s the tremendous support system which existed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The love and the friendship and the sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced and to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I somehow wish that would filter down. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I usually attempt to tell my children and now my grandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know that the legacy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our people, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually happened in in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I I'll give you the quick progression from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenheim</span> , if I remember correctly when you know we were working on looms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We we had to uh work on uh uh paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the warm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would disintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the things which what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Uh for that you could you could be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but somehow Mrs. Keegler intervened that people were not, and I remember at one time which was what I wanted to talk about Frau Keegler. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Uh it was shortly after I received the news about my father uh that I became very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I don't know exactly what I had but I know that all my fingernails started to have pus in it and I couldn't touch my hands and and I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...1t was called in which people were sick for a day or two could stay, and I was there and all of a sudden Lindsay (ph), you know, I think he has quite a name in the SS, he came on a sudden inspection and Frau Keegler charged into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I omitted to say my father made me wear my skiing boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">When I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...I last saw my father on the 28th of June and I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the 29th and I was separated from my mother the following day. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Before my father left, he said to me wear you skiing boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We were all avid skiers, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We lived in the the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ski mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">A lot of skiing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And I said why and my father said I want you to wear them and I said Poppa, skiing shoes in June...you know, I ought to wear a pair of sandals and my father said you have to wear them. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">You know, you didn't argue with your father in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I wore them for the entire three years that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in the in the lining I had hidden the pictures which are now in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">This is where the pictures were. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">At first I was able to keep them, at the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but later on and on the death march I had concealed them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So Mrs. Keegler charged in and she dragged me out of of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and she said Lindsay is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It's a matter of life and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I'll take you to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And she stooped down and she started to lace my boots and she dragged me to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">She used to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> before and I worked on four looms and she set the looms in motion and she said to me, pull yourself together and I remember I still heard the beating of the loom, you know, and everything was sort of at different angles because I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">He went through and if he would have found me there, she could not have saved me and there was no question about it, so that was how Keegler...but pretty soon it became obvious that the uh that they needed us in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was disbanded and we went to uh I think three different ones, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> (ph), . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">LT really don't remember the third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> was a horrible, horrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Uh we were locked on the fifth or sixth floor and uh every morning they would wake us with whips. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I worked in the flax detail which was a dreadful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Uh they were doing linens there, and flax uh submerged in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You had to pull it out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , you know, and uh when you opened the things and retracted the flax. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was terribly hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It was in summer and the mosquitos were all over us when we were working there and then I I was singled out to do something else, namely to unload coal at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Allegedly I give fresh answer to uh to one of the supervisors. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They are men, and for that I was banished to work the flax during the day and at the coal detail at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Uh it was an incredible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Then we...I also to load the flax uh into sort of silos which were I mean I think now that they were ten stories high. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They probably were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They probably were three or four, but you know you there was no balance because __ those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I I remember that it was nothing but torture you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">As soon as we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I was called to to go and went and unload coal and that was ___ the only time. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You know my father had asked me earlier...I forgot to mention it...during the first when my mother was so ill...J remember standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we heard that a family had committed suicide together. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I remember standing at that <span class="DLF">window</span> looking out at the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , my mother being so sick, my father with his hand in in the sling. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I hadn't...we hadn't heard from Arthur, you know, and I wished that my parents would suggest that. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">My father and I were both very close and he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he said, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He said promise that you are never going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I didn't answer him and he took his hand and he turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I promised him. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I remembered it during the working in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I didn't know if they were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or whatever, and I remember sort of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And at one moment I think I really came fairly close. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I felt a very strange pain in my neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Anyway, obviously I didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So...when things were really very very hard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> we worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> one days and I think that was really one of my lowest hours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">She was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing rings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">child's wagon</span> , and she had us pull her around in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">She was having a whip about it...I mean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And all of a sudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You see we all had numbers, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And they were calling numbers and I was working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I must have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Don't you even know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I didn't understand what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever it was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your own number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't know what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but what happened was as we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there was Director Keller from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And Yelda fell to her knees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he looked at me and he says I know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You worked on four looms. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You're coming along. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">They needed more people for uh working on looms in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> (ph) and this is how I got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> which was the other, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sister camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Yousee _if they had crossbars behind the open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> and one more â€”__ and when we got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so that was like a homecoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So this is how...I had one incident with Keller. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He called me into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> once and I just remember this most incredible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was that hugh hugh <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> on it and he sat alone at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and what struck me is that probably in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of that size, fifty of us slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have smuggled out a letter fromthe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp _</span> _. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I said I never smuggled a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I said I have written some letters and and when I glanced over it I saw...I had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> who was in the textile business because, you know, most people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> were in the textile, and my unc...and I gathered that he knew my uncle because it was a letter later on my uncle told me he had written to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Who had written to who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  My uncle had...when he found out in what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I was, had written to my, to Keller about me because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they encouraged me to write for more packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The packages apparently contained chocolate and things which were not obtainable, which I never saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They said the package must have been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy to write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because apparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I knew my uncle was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> but that he knew where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Anyway getting back to the thing...of course we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> which like <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> by comparison with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Uh only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> we then faced an...another difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So you know, we didn't see any light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we worked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you know Frau Keegler was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Things got worse there because there was very little food but uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit more about Landeshutz and Frau Keegler...
ANSWER:  Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there were not the things which happened in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or beatings or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were covered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Uh she tried to to get vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so- called coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Uh I remember when this one thing that I always tell young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Uh you know they knew of the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told us about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that would be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody fasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you know those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this was...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or whatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know, and they really jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody worked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't falter. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people reached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday we had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some of the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she would have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">On Hanukkah, we knew it was Hanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy celebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew that you know we couldn't light | but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still have the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I would like to translate it and give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I had a wondet...if I may skip for one minute just to make a happier thing...when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the first time in 1961 I my friends surprised me. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I knew of three that were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but actually ten showed up and I was the eleventh, and they got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , singing a song which we had written for the first Hanukkah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and we carried the menorah which I naturally have now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah which we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it meant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You can imagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our grandchild reflected in that...it's truly . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Uh so you know, that was possible under Frau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers and you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery substance. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> under one naked electric light and see the faces in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">What we did is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and comes tothe â€”â€” and_â€”_â€”_ says oh . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">That's how how it started out and then we of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters came to listen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her name is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="468">She lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who played her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of the past and uh I'll say it in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The <span class="DLF">exit line</span> on that was uh . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Do you understand German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  Translate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Uh come and look. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter Says... , OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and then we see them exiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we say to each other, . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Dear children, let us just say that uh humans endure more than they think they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And I think somehow uh considering how how young we were, we must have touched the core of our existence, the hope that someday to live in a world where our children and grandchildren would live, but best of all to live in such a climate where they will not believe our tales of the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And that was possible under Frau Keegler. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance, you know, and and we would sing songs in which we would say, you know, would make probably sound like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things in Polish, you know, which were exactly not meant for her ears, but but by and large uh that part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate, quote, unquote, that we were taken early yet, you know, before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was inits full â€”_â€”_â€”s aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Briefly uh and finally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> (ph) in . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> was an enormous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Uh its <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was one of the most beautiful in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in as much that it boasted the most beautiful collection of roses surrounding the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was direct contradiction of the beauty the ____ was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I will have to remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was director but he was one of the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he would jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He would have sort of a glazed look on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I don't know if...I tried to suppress the feeling...we called him Lalouche. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He was a beast. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Uh things changed very drastically then. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I still worked in uh for a very little time in the <span class="BUILDING">weaving factories</span> , but pretty soon they had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered sentence of death...spin__...spinning. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads which came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called ._____ </span><span class="sentence" id="498">are hugh machines which sort of shred that. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when whenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I perfected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being there including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom would always be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">In any event, the most dreaded thing on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> was that...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go to a <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed anything was immediately sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so you had to leave some life, usually between four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Uh there was something there with those x-rays. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I uh did a thing which I will always regret. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Uh the last day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that like the Jewish Federation, you know, when he did his registering, and we uh next to it was the ruins of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and we climbed over the debris and we sat there for a moment and one column of the <span class="DLF">eastern wall</span> stood un...undisturbed and everything else was in ruin and Arthur picked up a little stone and he handed it to me and he said just look at that column and always remember that our people will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And he give me the stone, and I made a little sack of it and I carried it on my neck, and when we went to to x-rays I took it off and I had it in my pocket and I don't know...it was later probably...I think it was on the death march that I lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And that was the one thing that I would...you know, pictures survived because I had them in my boot, but I lost that piece of stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Anyway, this was about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="511">There was a lot of people being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And and then see we knew that things were going bad with the war because there were uh not bombings but we had uh sirens were blowing every so often and uh we had to stop working. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">There was no electricity, and they were going crazy being vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Everybody there was incredibly bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They made us stand <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for for hours on appell, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And uh if a piece of bread flew over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , which it once did, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I'm proud to say about our people that nobody gave away the culprit. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We all knew who it was, and I think that this is that...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts that people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it sound like it was like a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> that people __ for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Look, I don't know what happened in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden name on everything that I have written . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">|! </span><span class="sentence" id="521">would say that people behaved in the most incredible manner imaginable by and large. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And I think that this would be something that cannot be emphasized enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> that Yelda once found a raspberry in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">She carried it in her pocket all day long and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed wire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I asked her to take a little bit of a bite and she wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">One single raspberry. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">A total possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">She gave it to a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There were other acts like that, many. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They unfortunately are not recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And I think this is probably the greatest tragedy of them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">The nobility and the love that was felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Anyway when things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for the Germans, they're probably going to finish us. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">When things are going good for for them or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I know we will forever be slave, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our obvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Uh the night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you know...we we were then about two thousand girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">An additional transport of two thousand came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They told us they had walked for I don't know how long from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we were going to to go on a march the following morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Destination later on we heard <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orianienberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orianienberg</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">murder camp</span> also, small enough known near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we started to march now to to...the death march, 29th of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I remember I had a terrible cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I was coughing terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Was Yelda, Suzie and Leisle (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">She sort of...she moved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, _. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">She and Suzie were were sort of like sisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Lei...Leisle was from from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and Suzie was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and Yelda and I from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and the four of us sort of formed friendships, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Leisle was the sort who looked after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I would say oh, it's raining today. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Do you think I should wear my green raincoat? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And she would say no, wear the navy blue one and have you been to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> to pick up apples yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I mean she would fall into any imaginary game and I remember that morning very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">You know there's such scenes in Dr. Zhavigo (ph) when you see this incredible uh almost like a wasteland of white...it was freshly covered snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The snow, it had snowed during the night and the whole thing in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in effect...1t was all all covered with snow and uh we were assembled and and they lifted their whips and forward, march. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And I remember Yelda said to me, she said I don't know how you're going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We'll all make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I was coughing so hard and we started the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this is the last chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And Yelda was to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I'm the only one left. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. (</span><span class="sentence" id="565">Pause) It was unspeakable. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I had my skiing boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I was the best equipped because I had my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We marched I don't know how many miles a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We came to rest sometimes in in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">A lot of...we stopped ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called _ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Uh people were shot continuously. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">If somebody stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , then you would see snow being red and there through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , beautifully covered with snow and birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Everyday the number got smaller and then we came (sniffling) to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , Yelda was already very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">One time we had nothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the more you eat, the more thirsty you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Uh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They would spray us with water and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody started to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping fingers)...people died like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Then one morning we were told, for example, we were going to leave there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I remember Yelda was frantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">She said that's going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don't want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Maybe we'll have a better chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And all of a sudden came in an incredible announcement, that President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Then I knew it was too late to run because you know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies of the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was a horrible blow, horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But we found something that day which sort of compensated us a little for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We found a wrapper of margarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We thought we'll certainly get very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And things got very bad from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Yelda was really very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little and went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall asleep and it started snowing, you know, you'll never wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Some people said it's the best thing we can do 1s fall asleep like that, and uh then one...we came to an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> and before we came to that <span class="DLF">orchard</span> sort of something incredible happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Oh yes...one time before that, because I thought Yelda was so sick, I said to her well we heard, you know...we saw a lot of people on the <span class="DLF">road</span> already...1t was an evacuation and people were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> sort of similar to when the war started, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And those people were running away from the front, and we heard somebody talking in a similar dialect, German dialect, that we had, so we concocted a whole sort of story, that we will run away in the next thing, and we will say that we, you know, will take our and we would say that we were with our mother on the on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we got lost, you know, and that we are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> because we had a similar dialect and of course with names like Yelda and Gerda you know, it was...and we we really had a whole thing how we are going to do it and Leisle and and Suzie were doing something similar, and we said our father was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wermarcht</span> and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> numbers and 1939 when the war...had to make it a long number that, you know, if they asked, so they will see that we tell the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And we came into that little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where we rested, and uh sort of took a signal to each other that we are going to stay there when they say everybody assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And suddenly Yelda looked up at me and she said I'm afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I was going to say come on, you know...and I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And when we got out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , they rounded up fourteen girls, some of our best friends were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we saw them all being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Right then and there I decided no matter what happens I'm never going to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I'll go to the end whatever the end is, but I'm not going to attempt to run away, you know, because we've had people already running and, you know, and uh the Gestapo, the SS was not too much in charge and, you know, it would be it would be OK, but we made a pact until then I said we're never going to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We were just saved by by her not, by her saying, you know, don't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And we...it was either that day or the next day...I don't remember, an incredible thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">People were running in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and threw bread at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And so we had bread and that night we rested in an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It was again it was snow...it started to...it was spring already. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was April and this was after President Roosevelt's uh death...1t was something like maybe the third week in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And uh I told Yelda to watch the bread, to hold on to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She was really very funny, already at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And my very dear friend uh ___ ran away and she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">She's in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">That's quite a story to tell you about her...how I found, how we found each other after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And uh what we didn't realize was that we had crossed over to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And those were the Czech people who were throwing bread and you see, if I would have known that I would have stayed because they would have hidden us. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We would not be, you know, because if you could make it and went to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or something, very possibly so the German farmers turned the girls over to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But never in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ...the Czech people threw us things and then there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they threw something. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It landed and it was an egg, and I was sure that that egg is going to make Yelda get well. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Hadn't seen an egg in years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And Yelda didn't even feel like having it. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And then one night we were again out in a meadow...snowing or raining...and a very dear friend of mine...her name is | Keller...she lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...came by and she brought two potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I don't know where she found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I remember I devoured mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I was so hungry and Yelda had the other one and Yelda said I'm not hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I just couldn't believe it that she wasn't hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And she said to me you eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I said maybe she'll feel better later, so I kept it and said I'll hold it for you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="630">Pause) She said she was thirsty, and I went to try to get water for her, and an SS man came and kicked her and she said why. (</span><span class="sentence" id="631">Pause) And then I tried to catch some water in my hand for her. (</span><span class="sentence" id="632">Pause) Then she said something incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">She said I'm not angry at anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I hope no one is angry at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then she said to me, you are going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And she said if my parents survived, don't tell them how I died. (</span><span class="sentence" id="637">Pause) (Crying) And then she said something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">She said to me you have to promise me that you are going to go on for one more week. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">A week was a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And she said promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And I said I'll try. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">When daylight broke, and I had...there were some, there were some blossoms on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and I had gone earlier and I had gotten a blossom for her to smell, and I showed her the blossom...it was all dead, probably from her fever, and when the sun got up, it was over for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And we were told to bury the dead of that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I remember the most minute details and <span class="NPIP">places</span> , names of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where we went through...I still and I cannot remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And sometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> sort of reminds me of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">You know, she's become over the years my my alterego, my â€”_ with my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And every year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible things that happened on the 29th. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no, forty-five, forty-five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Forty-nine...from 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I didn't see Suzie and Leisle. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I didn't know where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't know now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with tremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you know, Hitler is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We felt if 1t was true then either they're going to kill us now or maybe we will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It was uh we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ...things were really quite crazy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">A lot of people were on on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> again and uh soldiers running away and but we were still with the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">We had one woman SS with us and a couple of men. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously from thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill already, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset about, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...oh, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at that point, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And and that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called which I only realized that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Uh we were sort of <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was quite quiet suddenly and uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We were going to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my friend...oh yeah, and one SS woman came and told Keller...the one who's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...to take off my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Apparently she wanted...she saw I had good boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">She liked my skiing boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And said to me, I'll come, I'll hide you, and she hid me insome___, pretended, you know, there wasn't...she never took them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And then _____ said to me, uh and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was going to take us someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I have no idea where. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And she said you better get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , so that she shouldn't see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I suddenly said to her, you know, I really want to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don't know what but I'm in no hurry, you know, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And it sort of was a feeling that it is probably going to happen now. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They're going to kill us and I uh it was sort of at that point quite warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">After all the snow, you know, it was a balmy night and I thought to myself it's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I'm going to start thinking what it would be like for a night like that being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , being in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with my parents, so if they kill me that's the memory I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And the people, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came and some of our girls went on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We waited and waited and waited but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> did not come back and fortunately I heard that on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> uh there was one of the SS women who was pregnant apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And uh I don't know if they were shooting, and she was hurt and one of the SS men then turned and killed fourteen girls on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">No, I think it was fourteen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">You know, it's funny how how you play with numbers...fourteen or was it twenty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I really don't know but a goodly number of girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And we stayed there and uh and they came back for us and took us into sort of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or a <span class="DLF">hole</span> or something like that and they locked us up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We heard a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">There was uh shooting and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> overhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical Corps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the __s was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it was a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the <span class="DLF">doors</span> with chains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They told that we are going to be killed and I think before that there was some shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I remember some shooting was going on like it was here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh you know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Must have been quite ill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I remember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things behind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">A lot of people were very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We knew the Americans were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I saw two the night before, and then there was the crazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the biggest irony of them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They were shooting from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and Suzie was hit in the foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Not Suzie, Leisle. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the pump and I went to look for her and there she was, lying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> and she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I didn't want to go back to tell Leisle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So I I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">You see, I had seen...there were two Americans the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I spoke to them sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But that that is very vague to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But I remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I couldn't tell Leisle so I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I stood sort of in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It was a brilliant morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> a homemade white flag of peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I remember that was the first time I cried in many many months. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny because now I cry at the slightest provocation. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I cry when I see a dog or cat or something like that but didn't cry for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And uh and I was standing there and saw and all of a sudden I saw (pause) a strange <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coming down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , no longer green, not bearing the swastika, but a white star. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It was sort of a mud-splattered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> but I've never seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running towards us and one came toward where I stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He was wearing battle gear. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I have to think...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses and he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English, and I said I speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know if you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little afraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And he didn't answer me for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he said, so am I. I was...1t was the greatest hour of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And then he asked an incredible question. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">He said, may I see the other ladies? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">You know, was _____ we have been addressed for six years and then to hear this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He looked to me like a young guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I have to tell you I weighted sixty-eight pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">My hair was white. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">As you can imagine, I hadn't had a bath in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And this creature asked for the other ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I told him that most of the girls were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They were too ill to walk and he said won't you come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I said sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I didn't know what he meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">He held the <span class="DLF">door</span> open for me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel ___â€”_â€”sand that young American today is my husband. (</span><span class="sentence" id="734">Pause) And that's my story. (</span><span class="sentence" id="735">Pause) I was very ill after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They established a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I was told I was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Leisle unfortunately died a few days later of the wounds that she sustained. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He told me...he asked me if he could do something for me, and I said if you could write to my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and tell him I was alive and see if he had any news about my parents and my brother, and I didn't see him for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">You see, the following day the war was over too, and how I found out about it when we went to the...they was making a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> out of a <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> and uh I remember the incredible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">As a matter of fact, as I just told you, we had a reunion with the Medical Corps of the Division...
