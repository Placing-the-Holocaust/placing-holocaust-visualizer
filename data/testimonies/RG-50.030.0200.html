<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you please state your name, your date of birth, and your place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name now is George Salton. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I have used two other names in the past, but this will come out in...later in the discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> (ph) on January 7th, 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And could you tell me a little bit about your parents and their occupations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh my father was a small-town lawyer in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitchen</span> (ph), which a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of a county seat called , uh in German, and uh my mother was from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> and when the time came for me to be born, she decided to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to mother where her parents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> and uh where the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> were better, so I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> but I lived there for only seven days of my life, and then they brought me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I grew up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh my family consisted of my parents and an older brother, brother who was six years older and it was a as I remember it a nice life really for for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">While we were not very rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They were kind of a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to grow up in uh as a youngster with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and swimming and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  When you were growing up, was was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh mostly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> or a non-Jewish town?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, it was a...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a typical eastern European or Polish ..uh I'm talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> in which I lived, and it may...I I I suppose it had maybe five thousand people of...and of the five thousand, maybe two thousand or two and a half thousand were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Uh our family was relatively assimilated so I had both Jewish and non- Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I spoke only Polish and not Yiddish so that uh immediately uh limited my association with uh youngsters from <span class="BUILDING">religious Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And I I considered myself Polish as well as Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Of course that view of myself uh changed very quickly once the war came, because my Christian friends reminded me very soon that I was not one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  What uh...from the time the war began, what...how did your life change before you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , after the Germans came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Uh the war as you know started in September, September Ist, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I was eleven, eleven and a half years old and when the war started I remember uh as it was starting I remember the excitement of...excitement on the part of an eleven year old of seeing our parents uh you know getting ready and listen to the radio, listen to the news and there was something about uh I suppose exciting about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Then the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My father who was a a reserve officer in the Polish army expected to be mobilized but before anything happened uh the Germans came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and to the best of my recollection it was on the 8th of September, about a week or eight days after the war started, and uh things have changed from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">First uh the day after the Germans came or maybe two days after, they uh broke into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh and uh burned the Torahs (ph) and destroyed uh the the the contents and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and they imposed restrictions on the general population, but more severe restrictions on the Jews, arrested a number of uh intellectuals or people that they considered to be uh leaders of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Among them was my father who was arrested by the Gestapo about a week or maybe two weeks after the Germans arrived and and uh the life was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was getting progressively worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The restrictions were...that were imposed on us were were by themselves small but progressively more severe and the penalties were very, very severe, so therefore, for example, one was prohibited from shopping in certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> or later prohibited from uh being walking on certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> or later required to wear a white arm band with a blue Star of David on it, or prohibited from using the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">While each restriction by by by itself was not all that severe, the penalty was very frequently imprisonment or execution and consequently life was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And as as time passed, uh life became more and more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In addition to it, there were Jews, and my parents in particular were unable to exercise uh their professions or make a living and we had to sustain ourselves by slowly selling whatever possessions we had...furniture, fur coats, piano...and so the life was difficult and uh and in addition to it, my my friends, my former associates who were Christians uh now were quite uh sensitive to the fact that I was not one of them and made me and let me know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I remember the day when the when our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed and when the Germans pulled out the torahs on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and burned it...uh we youngsters were observing this and wanted to know what the Germans were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My Christian friends stayed and laughed and said that that's kind of a funny uh incident where I and maybe one or two other Jews who were there felt aa sense of damage or destruction, and kind of laughed, you know, destroyed and so things like this have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So my life has changed both because there were restrictions on the Jews, because there was uh economic hardship, and because there was a general rejection by those of my friends whom I with whom I associated prior to the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Now you then went into a a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Is that correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Can you tell me about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I...let me just add something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There is one something else that happened of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Uh the the war started in September of 1939 and and shortly we were occupied uh mid-September or late September, the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> opened again. </span><span class="sentence" id="39"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> in Europe started usually the first Monday in September, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was...I think was in the fifth grade at that time and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was time to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I remember my teacher who who was known as anti-Semitic, my Polish Christian teacher, uh taking me aside with some sense of embarrassment and telling me that Jews were no longer allowed to attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so there was another change. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was another another restriction on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">To to go back to your question, yes, uh life was getting more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There more and more restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My father, after a number of months of uh being imprisoned, was uh released, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a broken, sick man and uh the restrictions that the Germans imposed upon us were greater and greater. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">There was some terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">There was some executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions, the demands, until early in 1942 uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established 1n in and uh slowly the various uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> both 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were compelled to leave all possessions behind and move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so in the spring of 1942 my family uh was required to move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the oldest part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was very congested. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">There was lots of misery and hunger and uh uh sickness and it was really as terrible as one can imagine life to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was at that time fourteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Let me talk to you a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if that's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There were always I would guess maybe fifteen to twenty thousand Jewish people in this very small section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , uh small section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was surrounded by a very tall <span class="DLF">wooden fence</span> which was guarded continuously by both German and Polish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Food was very limited and there was really no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We managed to to share a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a with one of my father's brothers who was also an attorney and people were living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and it was just terrible and in those circumstances the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was full of rumors or speculations. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh people were speculating that something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There were rumors that people who are not working will go to work, uh will be compelled to to go to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> outside of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to to work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was other speculation that people will be sent here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a fearful, terrible ttme which was made worse by a growing terror on the part of the Germans who would come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at night and execute people at random, just kind of break into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh into an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , enter an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and take out the two women or a man and his son and execute them, and then uh leave that <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and go to another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">If something in in their pattern that appeared completely random and execute some other people for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It did condition us, however, to be really fearful and terrorized and made us realize that uh we have virtually no choices, because the community, the the Christian community, the Polish community outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not supportive or sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">If anything they they be...they were active in in uh spotting and denouncing Jews who left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when a penalty for doing it was execution and as the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were getting worse and worse uh people thought about doing something else, but there were virtually no choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">One either had to stay and hope for the best or take a chance and jump over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and that was not an easy thing to do because uh unlike soldiers who really are responsible for themselves, most people had children or wives or parents and and one who was maybe willing to be courageous and put one's own life at risk, but few people are willing to do that to their own family, so that was the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Hunger, misery, terror, execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Did you have any particular daily activity? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Did you try to continue your studies or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There was there was no opportunity to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Some people of course in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Uh my father found a some job 1n some social organization which really I I think had no other value than he gave him a aa some certificate that uh that that allowed him to be excused in any kind of a a raid for for workers to work on the on railroad and so on, but there was no education. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There was no...nothing formal. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Uh of course our Jewish and intellectual roots uh cause us caused us to continue doing it, so there was some private private teaching and former <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students who were maybe teenagers were uh busy teaching reading and writing to youngsters and I who was fourteen was also sometimes asked to teach young children of nine or six to how to read and write, so there was a little bit of act...there was some, there was some, there was a structure to deal with it but nothing formal. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Much of the time was spent uh wandering through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> looking for some opportunity to to do something that would secure some food or listening to rumors or just wasting time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Did any kind of an underground organization develop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  There was uh...first of all, you have to understand that as a as a fourteen year old, I wasn't necessarily trusted enough to to be taken into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh I don't know that there was a underground organization that uh that had plans to enter into combat, but there was, there were many underground organizations that dealt with the cultural and social life of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and uh uh approved and...I shouldn't say approved...but uh supported activities that were really prohibited by by the Germans like teaching or having some religious services or having some social services that provided whatever little help one could provide to to the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It took courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It took commitment, even though it did not involve carrying a gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about six months, and...uh in in about June of 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was fully of rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Rife was rumors that something is going to happen and uh it gave it it caused us all to be very active, to run from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> to to listen for some rumors, and I remember being one day uh together with my brother who was uh twenty at that time...I was fourteen...in front of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the <span class="BUILDING">German work office</span> , <span class="BUILDING">labor office</span> uh and people...whatever there were there...maybe two or three hundred people standing and milling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There was fear in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There was concern and at some point some of the officials of the the German officials came out and started examining identity papers of those people that were ed...on the edge of the crowd and again people were saying (cough) oh this is good or bad and those whose papers will be somehow examined will be sent out to work and others were saying those that whose papers are examined will be allowed to stay here, and it (cough)...excuse me...and 1n in the course of that uh activity and that...all that was accompanied you must understand while beating and kicking and hitting...and they looked at the young man's paper, a man, a young man who was maybe sixteen or seventeen at that time...I I knew him...and uh his papers, his identity card which was yellow...that was specifically uh given to Jews...uh yellow because the Germans consider yellow to be a color of shame and they were very very much involved with the symbolism of that...and his papers indicated that he had some physical limitation that uh excused him from random assignment to la...to to work groups, and one of the Germans looked at these papers and said, ah...1n German of course...you didn't want to work before so the heck with you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And that gave us, of course, all of us, a great crowd of a few hundred people an indication that having the paper somehow stamped, the process was a positive thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everybody started pushing forward with their papers in hand and the Germans, the...additional German officials came out and was shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and beating and pushing people back, and it it happened that the man in charge of that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was a a man of German origin who lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> before the war and was a teacher, a high school teacher, my brother's <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He recognized my brother and said to him, give me your paper and of course my brother also gave him mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Our papers were taken away and we went...our papers and the papers of a number of other people, and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Again, the rumors were they are not letting us know what what this is all about and the next morning the Jewish police...they were kind of Jewish police is really...that's what they were called but they more like like couriers and and and uh people who help keep order...anyway a Jewish policeman came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and returned mine and my brother's paper and they had a stamp put from the German Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We didn't know what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We, again, were driven by rumors and speculation. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh two days later there was an announcement in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This is now late June of 1942...I have to take some water...(pause)...announcements posted on all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in Polish and in German and in Yiddish I believe, basically saying that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is being being evacuated, being moved or the inhabitants are being moved to a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Let me just point out that this was in June of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh the German-Russian war started in June of '41 and June of '42 was the height of German success in in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> where the large segments of Russian were under German occupation, so it made sense when they said that the ghetto population is being moved to a large <span class="DLF">communal farm</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> that sits idle. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There will be work there, that the trip will take uh three days and that people should take food along for three days which really silly because we had no food, and that uh what the climate is going to be and uh what clothing to take along and that everyone except those who have stamps on their ID cards, on their identification papers, are required to to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Deported is not the term they used, but to be moved to that new new <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I didn't want to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I was fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I was the youngest son. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I wanted to go with my parents, but my parents said no, uh stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You'll be with your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We don't know what's going to happen over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">In retrospect, I don't know...they they had some premonition that that story was really a lie as as you can gather. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Anyway uh a week later the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was divided into two parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The lar...1t was the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> but we call...they called it the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">One corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was uh surrounded by an <span class="DLF">internal fence</span> and the instructions were given by the Germans that all those who had their cards stamped including their wives and children had to move to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and no one in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...no one can be in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without a stamp on his card and if there is anyone found without the stamp on his card, he or she will be executed and all others are to move to the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was then in the course of four days with great violence, and great shooting and blood, uh driven to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> on four consecutive days and driven and taken to what I believe...and maybe some people believed to...was this <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Me and my brother stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We were assigned jobs at the <span class="BUILDING">local factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh that was kind of a random process. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Those who who stayed were assigned to to work groups, and me in one...1n a group that was doing construction on a housing construction on this large uh <span class="BUILDING">airplane engine factory</span> that was built by the Poles before the war but was not operating, now was operated by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Benz</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span> if you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They are the same company, and my brother was assigned to the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> but in another group where they were doing repairs of damaged airplane engines. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And so we we were marched under guard every day to that to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , about uh five miles or maybe five kilometers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in separate groups and we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The work was hard and miserable but we worked and we came back and we met at night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and uh hoping to hear something from our parents because we believed, or at least I believed...I had no reason not to...that they are someplace in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And of course that was...there's no suspense then and of course they all went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">destruction camp</span> and all the people were driven naked into <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">After about three weeks of working in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , one day...and our group was maybe a group of hundred people...after about three weeks of working and the marching every day to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , one day when the work, when the job was over, the officials in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> said to us you are not going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We have built a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp uh</span> within the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , right outside the <span class="DLF">factory walls</span> but kind of adjoining the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and you're staying here tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You're not going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So we were taken there and the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was</span> Reischof, and I need to look at my piece of paper here to tell you how it was spelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was spelled R - EI-S-C-H-O- F. And uh when we were marched to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we discovered there were about three hundred other Jewish people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Most of them were people who were selected in the process of deportation and during the day's deportation there were people who had professions like watchmakers or watch repairmen or locksmiths uh because this was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in which they needed people that knew something about uh uh mechanical or metal working, either mechanical work or metal work. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Apparently we were taken to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh a long period of three years, almost three years, started. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh this was a camp of some that varied between three hundred and five hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Virtually all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Uh the work was uh was inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and inside the the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> working on lathe or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drill presses</span> for some of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">For others like me, working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in construction or sweeping the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and before I tell you more about the conditions and what happened, let me say something about my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My brother continued to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which they repaired airplane engines. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I...so he was still...he was not confined to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">His group continued to come every day to uh to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and since I was, my job was to sweep the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I managed to sweep the <span class="DLF">street</span> under the <span class="DLF">window</span> in which he worked and so we could say hello to each other, and that continued for about four months and uh sometimes in late uh late '42, his group as well as the remnants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that the Poles, all those people was the was their was the stamps on their ID cards and including some other groups that was still going to work from the from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and shipped on to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> on the in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I I discovered it when I went to see my brother that the group was not uh no longer working there, that they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I was , and that week a man whom...this was in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a man whom I knew before the war who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with my brother, came to see me and gave me a note from my brother and that note indicated that he jumped out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and joined the partisans, so he continued to to exist in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> together with partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I continued to receive notes from him on and off without telling me very much about where he is or his what name he was using for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In September...I think it was the 7th of September, 1943...he sent me a note through some people that worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that he is about to enter on a mission which will prevent him from uh contacting me and that we shall see each other after the war and that we should find each other by writing once the war is over to our uncle and aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and this would be a way to find out each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Needless to say, I have never heard from him since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I have no idea what happened but I can guess that he like countless others didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was (cough) very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Life was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There was hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There was beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">There were there were the guards were Ukrainians and they they were quite cruel and and miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Our our overseers, our masters were were Germans, German civilians who were also unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Our Polish co-workers really didn't show any sympathy and given that it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which I was I I was born in, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which I grew up (coughing)...excuse me...every once in a while I'll meet someone whom I knew before the war who was maybe...they were they were not my age because I was too young to to really be there, but they were maybe older brothers of my friends, and their reaction to seeing me was, are you still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And so that was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and whatever whatever comfort there was, we found in each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">People who were strangers, people who maybe didn't like each other, found a special fellowship, special kinship with each other and we tried to support each other and tried to help each other. (</span><span class="sentence" id="147">Cough) Another thing...a thing happened to me which 1s one of those incidents that uh that reoccurred over and over during the war where something happened over which I had really no control or or when it happened I had really no way to project what it will lead to that allowed me, that that that saved my life and gave me an opportunity to continue, you know, with my struggle to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The first of them was this incident of finding a man in the in the labor department who was my brother's teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I mean there was really no way that I would have managed, especially at my age, to have my card approved. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">What happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh I started working after maybe eight months of working <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , sweeping <span class="DLF">streets</span> and working on construction, I was assigned to work inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I was marched to that large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and led in together with all the other people inside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and was walking through the <span class="BUILDING">factory building</span> to my assigned place of work (cough) and I noticed that in front of me there was a man in a white coat walking and something fell out of his pocket and instinctively I ran after him, picked up that envelope it was, and chased him and gave him that envelope, and he kind of looked of me and was pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The look appeared pleased and walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It turned out that night when the police came looking for me that it was his pay envelope and he was one of the German engineers working. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Now they came looking for me because he wanted to tell me that he appreciated me returning his money to him, that it was really surprising that somebody who's Jewish would not steal it but return him the money, and frankly when I discovered it was money I was had some second thoughts of whether I should have done it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">About six months later I we I was working on a...cleaning windows, standing on a long <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , because in addition to working twelve hours a shift in the inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we were required to work in the evening, on weekends and doing other work and I was standing on this long <span class="DLF">ladder</span> cleaning a <span class="DLF">window</span> above a <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> when one of the German guard guards kicked the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> from under me. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I fell down and there was a grate at the bottom in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> which are common in Europe on which people were able to scrape their shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Anyway I fell, uh cut my knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was very badly damaged and injured and since we had no physicians and no medicine, it was infected and my knee was stiff and I really couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was running high temperature and after a number of weeks of being sick and miserable, I was selected together some others uh to be to be driven to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> which we believed was really a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they executed people that were not useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And uh I was too sick and too beaten to really to care, to really be able to resist it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And as I was sitting on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or standing on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with maybe six or eight or other people, that uh German master came by, the German engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He recognized me and uh said oh, this is a very important worker that I cannot spare and took me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and a job was assigned to me, a wonderful job...the best job one could have there...to be a janitor cleaning uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That may sound strange but this was a job that one had some degree of freedom because there was not a supervisor that stood over one. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">One could go walk and go and clean and and it gave me an opportunity in the next four or five months to recover, but again that little incident was one of those and there were others and I will mention them as I go along, that that were those lucky things for which I claim no responsibility because when I found the envelope and gave it back to him, I had no way of knowing that where it's going to lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Anyhow it was one those lucky incidents that allowed me to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh we were in that camp, working. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh there were a number of miserable things...some uh executions and killing and beating and hunger and misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I remember one incident that I I remember it quite well because I could never really understand it and I still don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">One day...it must have been spring of '43 when the leaves were turning green and and uh weather was turning turn turning nice, when two young men and they must have been nineteen or twenty, young prisoners, escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They tunneled themselves under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was on a Saturday or on a weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">On a Sunday it must have been because we did work on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They tunneled themselves under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and escaped and there was much excitement and the Poles living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood villages</span> joined the Ukrainian guards in chasing them and they were caught by the by the two, by the Ukrainian guards with the help of the Polish peasants, brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , badly, very badly beaten and uh somehow the the authorities, the guards sent for the German Gestapo man who incidentally survived the war and was not not punished very much but that's another story...sent for the Gestapo man to come to deal with this breach of of order. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I remember he came on a in a in a kind of horse-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> with his wife who was...he must have been a young man in his thirties with his young wife and two little children, really blonde, pink (ph) children. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Left them sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> outside of the <span class="DLF">camp gate</span> and uh the kids were running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The wife was sitting over there while he went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , tortured the two men and executed them, and I could never understand how a person who obviously had tender feelings for his family, who thought that it was a good opportunity to take his wife and children on a Sunday spring outing, would just transition from by just crossing the <span class="DLF">threshold</span> of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and to become a a terri...a terrible torturer and executioner, but these were the things that happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And I'm trying to remember...1t was a long period of about a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Difficult work. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Difficult conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Uh many tragedies, people trying to escape and being caught and and brought back and people executed but 1n the passage of time in spring of 1944 or maybe it was...yeah, it was late winter 1944 when...you understand that I was taken to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in July of '42 and about a year and a half later in spring of '44, the Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The Ger...the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was advancing and uh and uh they were not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but they were someplace in in <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> , but anyway they were close enough and as you may know the Russian advances were kind of . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They will advance uh a hundred miles and then stop for a few months waiting I suppose for their supplies and logistics to catch up with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Anyway the Russians were advancing and the Germans decided to evacuate most of their key machinery in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as well as us, those four or five hundred Jewish prisoners who were in the camp who by that time were considered kind of specialists or important people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So one night in a great panic the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> showed up and the machines were being loaded and dis...(cough)...uh disconnected from the electric uh wiring and loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left and the next day the rest of us were put on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that arrived and shipped west toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Uh however in the interim between the time when the machines were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to be shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the next day when we were deported, a number of people managed to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">There was a group of uh about eighteen people that escaped because the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">There was confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They escaped, uh and I have met one of the escapees after the war and who...and he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now and it turned out that they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They were hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I should say, and then encountered the Polish national army resistance group who looked upon hiding Jews as bandits and they were, all but one were killed by the Polish resistance group. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Our group in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved very slowly west, and we were deposited in a camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> (ph) which was a major uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">execution camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It was a camp in which most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> was liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was located in a on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> of a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there we were given new numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Incidentally, I had...my number in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp 222</span> , a very low number. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> I had the number of 25,113, and assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and made to work digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> which was full of skeletons and and uh <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We were just digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> and filling them in but it was...it was really a brutal and terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Uh people were beaten at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There were continuous execution, almost random execution of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> maybe a month, and then sent to another camp that was even worse, uh not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was well-known for having major <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> and uh my ancestors lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I didn't say that my my original name in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was Salzman (ph) and uh that means salt man and my...I, as I recall the story of I heard from my father, my ancestors lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and their business was to buy and transport salt to the neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and when in the late 17th century or maybe it was early 18th century, the tax officials decided that everyone including Jews must have last name for tax purposes, and they just called my...they assigned a name to my great-great-grandfather uh that he had...uh that was associated with his occupation, so that's where the Salzman came and it was at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was located, with most of the prisoners working in the <span class="DLF">salt mine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Let me go back for a second, if I may, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Can you give me a little bit more information, more detail about what it was really like and what your routine was like and and how you survived that that daily trauma?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Well, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a very crowded camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">There were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in which there were great crowds of prisoners uh sleeping on kind of a three tier shelves. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh food was very very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Our work was uh basically hard like labor where it was really no skill required and which made anyone of us expendable. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...if someone's working on a drill press there was some value to one's identity, because if that operator of the drill press was executed, the drill press would idle until they found somebody else that they could train, but digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was really black labor, labor that was, that had no identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It was just uh kind of useless labor and we were all vulnerable to be beaten or executed uh and uh one just existed from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">One just had a a kind of a inwards determination and to one's mind and to one's heart to just kind of bear with it, to to somehow avoid being identified, never to stand in the front row and if one marched in columns of five to be in the middle rather than the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , to to appear busy, to avert one's eyes, to to be driven by an instinct for survival which was I think is in all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The other thing that was different about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> in in that camp for the first time I encountered uh women prisoners, Jewish women prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They were I believe from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and it was it was an additional injury to my humanity to see women about whom I have romanticized, because I was just a young man of sixteen you know, being compelled to work hard and being compelled to walk around half dressed and to not being given any facilities for sanitary purposes that somehow gave them some degree of privacy, and all those things kind of added together to make us, to make me feel uh less than a human being really,but feel as a kind of a uh uh...a a a machine that whose purpose was to avoid exposure, to avoid any kind of a risk and just survive by uh obeying and following and doing the kind of things that I felt uh uh avoided uh being singled out by people, by the guards and by the SS supervisors who uh amused themselves I believe or satisfied some of their sadistic uh drives by beating and and killing people for no reason at all and and what one had to do is somehow be both lucky and be sufficiently assertive to avoid that situation when one could be singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Uh II avoided it, not because I was really more aggressive than the others, but because I I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So that...when I look upon those months there, just months of of of ailment, of a of a sickness of mind and body...
QUESTION:  You were not able to continue the factory work that you had been doing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reischof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Oh no, no...we were just there, working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And then when we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> we were...1n which we were for a very short time, uh we were just also kind of like working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and sleeping and uh and we were now emersed in a large mass of prisoners uh with the German SS men who were over us walking through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you know, shooting people at random and and uh there was, we were just part of the mass. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I was part of the mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Did they tell you why they sent you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Nobody told us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I was st...the the the the the consideration of being ever told or being or having any kind of explanation or justification uh doesn't apply. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I mean we were kind of like uh if one has rabbits and one has chickens, one doesn't explain to chickens why they are being put in this or that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We were treated in that way, and of course people speculated and this and that, but most of the most of our energy was was concentrated, was was spent on surviving of...on somehow nurturing that little piece of bread we received everyday, or the bowl of cabbage soup and of uh trying to make sure that our shoelaces when they broke could be repaired because if one was broken, had broken shoelaces one would limp, and if one limped one was singled out as somehow being being uh disabled and that was sufficient to be killed, so that's where our energy went, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I mean the the little daily things that gave one a chance...no guarantee, a chance to make it through the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And if one was hit by somebody or injured or if one fell down and had a bruise, that was sufficient to be singled out and not make it through the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So that's where our energy went. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh no one told us why we were there and we re...we really didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We were sufficiently beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We were sufficiently damaged that we somehow didn't expect any explanation, didn't expect any humane treatment, didn't expect to be treated as anything that was...that had any value.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  What did you do at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  What did you do at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> we were relatively short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I would say maybe a week, and they made me work uh on a...breaking stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They had piles of stones that were the size of uh a basketball and they gave us a hammer and uh sit on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and we breaking the stones into smaller pieces and it was it was suitable for paving unpaved <span class="DLF">roads</span> , but that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And and and again I am saying this kind of unskilled labor was the most dangerous job to to do because there was no value in any individual worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">There were there were thousands of hundreds of thousands of people gassed and killed every day so there was basically unlimited supply of replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Things have changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">At at the end of one week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> , the four hundred or four hundred and fifty of us who came from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reischof</span> were assembled and they had a way of assembling us, and put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and moved west, or we assume it was west. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I really don't know that I could tell the direction but the others said we were moving west. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was first...it was the first indication that the identity of that group that worked for a year and a half in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reischof</span> was still retained and had some meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It was a very long trip and for people that survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , frequently the worse memories have to do with trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Trips which maybe by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> or by conven...normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> today would take three or four hours, took four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were sidelines and made to wait on on some back, back towns on the back rails and without food and water, very cramped and after four days of such a journey we arrived in a <span class="REGION">mountainous region</span> uh where we were made to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , those of the few people that died along the way...we were made to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We were surrounded by uh a group of SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Young SS men was holding dogs and machine guns and turned out it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> (ph) and it is in uh now in in uh it 1s...1t was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> in not far from the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> , not far from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoff</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="246"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> was a well-known <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">penal camp</span> where most of the work was in the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Anyway, we were caused (ph) to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The SS were very happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They were laughing, saying well these are the first Jews we are getting here since 1939 and we're glad to have you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And they were really cynical. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Marched us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> you took a . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">As the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , it stopped at a at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which others could identify as being <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I must confess I didn't know very much about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> except that it was a big and bad <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But others of those four hundred and fifty of us or others at least in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> in which I was confined, knew what it was and there was a great cry and lamentation (ph) that we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They must have known what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It's just difficult to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">People prayed and it's always a wonder wonder to me that in those circumstances when there was no God and no mercy, people prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Let me take a minute. (</span><span class="sentence" id="260">Pause - Drinking) We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> for six weeks and work was in a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , very difficult work and we had to go break stones and carry stones on our back and the guards were brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We were for the first time really exposed to to German kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Kapos were uh trustees. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They were prisoners, frequently prisoners from criminal institutions, from <span class="BUILDING">criminal prisons</span> where people who were come...were were there for committing some violent crimes like murder, something like this, and they were made trustees in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and we were for the first time exposed to kapos who were also brutal and miserable and who I believe tried to outdo the German guards in order to retain their privileged position. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh it was just one of those difficult nightmares that went on from day to day and one had to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">One had to avoid again being somehow singled out or beaten or injured or or fractured. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I worked in the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I also had the job...and I was sixteen at that time I believe...I had a job carrying dead bodies to the crematortum where they were burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">These were people who who were either executed or died in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or died of hunger or exhaustion. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I worked sweeping <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I did all kinds of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">There was one experience that I remember that is not really cruel but philosophical. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It turned out that people who worked at certain jobs, they would get additional meal at noon time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They would give us one bowl of soup for two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You have to remember a bowl of watery soup with some leaves or some piece of potato in 1t for two people who each one of them equipped with his own spoon and and this was ready made for conflict and combat and and and and uh the the spilling of soup and so on, but somehow before I arrived a a custom was developed over there where the two prisoners, skeleton-looking hungary prisoners who would be given this bowl of soup to share, would feed each other, so if you gave me half a spoon, I gave you half a spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And if you dipped down and found a piece of potato, I'll dip down and give you a piece of potato, and so that customs or that habits or that arrangement which had both philosophical and not religious undertones, people managed to people who were strangers, people who were dying of hunger managed somehow to be disciplined and to go through that daily ritual of sharing the bowl of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">After six weeks of work and hard labor...oh yes...I'm I'm forgetting something...when we first came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , we were marched by this young SS guards with their dogs up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we we were brought before a very large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in a kind of assembly area, and we were...there were four hundred and fifty of us approximately, and we were all told to undress, to leave our clothing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and all our possessions and we go in to take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Now there was concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There was speculation, because by that time we knew about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We knew that our parents who were who went to the to the allegedly were sent to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the east were really killed and sent to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We knew about that, and there was great concern that we may be taken to a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">This was typical...this the thing...undress...go in naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But there were really no choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The choice was to resist and be killed, to run, to fight, to or to just hope and to do what one was told and hope that it was true that what they said that we will take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I left my clothing and I left what whatever little possessions I had of my own that I carried through all the years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and these possessions were a little handkerchief in which I had tied photographs of my brother and my parents, and after that we were really given <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and when the shower was over, made out...made to go out through another <span class="DLF">door</span> where we were given new stripped uniform and uh and uh wooden shoes and all those things that we left behind we have never seen again, so I have not had a picture of my parents until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where my aunt uh gave me a picture of my parents when they were first married. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">This uh...I remember them only vaguely that way, and I have no picture of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> for about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Worked very hard and one time we were exposed to a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Uh selection was a process where everybody stood naked and the a few SS people, one of them I believe a physician, kind of went by and marked us with a green ink writing numbers or some symbols on our forehead and he did it to me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I don't know what it meant and we didn't know or we didn't care anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Didn't know, didn't care, but that night again our group was assembled, put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...that group of four hundred and fifty. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Sent west I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Or sent west. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Again this terrible long journey and it was it was uh like late spring of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You remember February, March and they sent us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We were there for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> , then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> for six weeks and about April when I have to now really estimate the specific months...uh April '44 we were sent west and after a journey of about six or seven days we arrived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...we didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I mean I got...when I say <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> I mean that's in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">At that time we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Along the way experienced great hostility from the Germans along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We knew we were being driven through...we were being driven, if that's the right term to apply to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , through through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We sometimes stopped in a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and through the little <span class="DLF">windows</span> , through the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> , we would call for some water because this was the greatest suffering...that we had no water for these days, or very little water. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And the Germans would mock us and say, you know, this and that...wouldn't help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There was great hostility. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">After that long journey we arrived in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...
QUESTION:  We're going to take a brief break and change the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1 Tape #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  We left off with your having just arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Yeah, I I uh I made...I stressed some of the unfriendly and difficult and and hostile ex...encounters that we had along the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> to contrast what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> , which uh was special and I I I remember it with great emotion, so if I get upset, let no one be embarrassed by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We were made to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at some <span class="NPIP">site</span> , rail..<span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a sign called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I really didn't know what it was uh or what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, even though some people said well, it uh it's <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I just... must confess I don't remember at what point I found out that it was <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and then under SS guard made to march through this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which 1s an ancient <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of uh you know...it looks medieval and old <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and cobblestones. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We had wooden shoes and our marching made a tremendous clatters on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It was early in the morning and as we were being marched people were, who were going to work, civilians, were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> were stopped and people were stopped to let us pass, a column of a few hundred people in stripped uniforms. (</span><span class="sentence" id="316">Crying) And the people cried. (</span><span class="sentence" id="317">Crying) For the first time I saw support. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I saw people cared. (</span><span class="sentence" id="319">Crying) I have to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  It's OK, George. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Just take your time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  You know, I never cry when I am...remember sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I cry when I remember happy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Anyway, people (crying)... people cried and they threw their sandwiches or whatever they were carrying in their lunch box, packages at us which we couldn't pick up and cigarette, packs of cigarettes... (crying)...and they booed. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They booed the Germans who were escorting us, who made us take of our caps every time we passed a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with a Nazi swastika flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It really was such a special experience, not only for me but for the others with whom I have talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">While most of us didn't survive the war...of those four hundred and fifty, on that day maybe twenty-five survived or thirty survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Uh we felt human. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We felt human for for a while and that was a special gift that the people gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And we were taken then to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was kind of a temporary <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in outside of of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> where we were kept for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Uh we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Just sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There were hardly any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We were eating grass, but at night fruit and (crying) bread was thrown over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> by unknown people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">After about a week of that, and it was special. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I I get more emotional about it and I become embarrassed that I am that I am about those other <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were terrible because it was a a unique encounter with human kindness which I had forgotten about. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">After a week we were put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again, again after a few, two days of traveling, arrived in a kind of a mountainous area called uh in which which we discovered was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orbas</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It's a small, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in in <span class="REGION">eastern France</span> in which there was a unfinished <span class="DLF">railroad tunnel</span> and in inside the <span class="DLF">railroad tunnel</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> set up to manufacture airplane engines and most of the machines and many of the supervisors were those people back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reischof</span> uh who were who left sometimes back in in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Again uh circumstances of of luck that for which I take no responsibility and decisions that were made outside of my presence uh completely outside of any influence that we had, that some German officials in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or whatever, decided that it is valuable to retain this group of four hundred and fifty specialists which they considered us at that time, and had us catch up with the machinery that was being transferred to defense (ph) and uh uh absent that, we would certain not survived because working in <span class="DLF">stone quarries</span> or <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> or some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> was a job where one survived for only weeks and we worked with Frenchmen, uh guarded by Germans but working with Frenchmen in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and it was a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The French workers that we worked with, the French worker I worked with shared his food that he brought with him...they used to bring a lunch bucket and they usually shared an apple or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Uh on weekends I was made to work 1n the in the in a <span class="BUILDING">farm complex</span> in which the SS were located washing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> for soldiers and as I did that strangers would throw apples or other things to me and uh and uh, you know, the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">There were hills with goats on it and little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and uh we were still unhappy and miserable and the guards would still uh the SS guards that guarded the thing was still cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They have uh a few people were shot and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">One man was told by a young guard I remember who was maybe nineteen to hey, run away and he ran and as he ran about six feet, the man killed him, but it was a different environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It was a somewhat better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">One night I remember I was walking through this <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I was made to carry something and uh on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there was a piece of newspaper with a large headline, and my judgment wasn't very good at that time and I picked it up and stuck inside my jacket and then that night when we looked at it, 1t said in German, <span class="REGION">fortress Europe</span> under attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It uh really was the D-Day invasion and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> by the Allied Forces from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was very reassuring. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We were happy about it, but we really didn't know exactly where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We didn't know how the Americans were doing and the the Allies were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The newspaper was not uh uh was not really honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">It's kind of said they attacked but they are being beaten back. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But finally we didn't expect really anything good to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We didn't expect...the whole idea of being liberated or being free or being autonomous was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We were conditioned now to be prisoners, to live in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , to be given cabbage soup, to be told what to do, to be completely without rights, to be beaten, you know, and so anyway the Americans were coming and in August as you remember...the Americans landed in June of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They was landing in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> uh by early in August as I as I believe, and in August of '44 they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and shipped us east. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">First the machines left and then we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">As our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> , we looked out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">On our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> with four hundred and fifty of us...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and we would looked...no, we looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We were looking out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with all the machines that we worked on sitting on the side railing, completely destroyed by a air raid and we knew that that connection was behind us, that connection with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Incidentally this is also the time of the...1n retrospect when there was the last attempt on Hitler's life in August of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I just remembered now. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Uh was a long, long journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Many people, a number of people died from hunger and thirst. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We arrived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It was one of the largest camps in uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my number over there...just to tell you how big...was 107,081. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I was under the name the name of Salzman (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We were put in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the four hundred and fifty of us were assigned to work in a ina ina <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where iron devices like uh axles for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and so on were being stored and we were caused to move it and required to move it and assemble it and pile it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don't know that there was really any sense to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was hardness of the work...uh same thing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Beating, hunger, uh uh rejection again. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I know I'm kind of not emphasizing here...that I'm...but you know, we just was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That's how life was. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">There was nothing exciting that happened from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">One got up and one hoped that it wouldn't rain and one hoped that the shoe which didn't have a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">One hoped that one got into <span class="DLF">line</span> to to get one's soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">If one was at the right point in the <span class="DLF">line</span> so when one got the the bowl of soup it wasn't from the top but was from the bottom of the of the of the container where there was a little bit more cabbage and these were the things that occupied our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There wasn't anything dramatic or wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Was just to survive to and little things in life were the kind of things that allowed us to somehow sustain ourselves another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Uh if one uh was required to move a big piece of iron, one somehow tried to do utmost to have six people rather than four people, because four people carrying that piece of iron would be so much more difficult that one's ability to survive, to somehow carry another day, would be diminished. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So I don't know what others say, but I must tell you those monontenous terrible days were were occupied by the by the compulsion to survive, by doing those little tiny things, you know, by somehow uh being able to find a needle to fix one's pants or to sew on a button because one needed this button to be warm and one needed the button to look orderly and proper, to not somehow be singled out by a guard who could use that for whatever purpose he wanted to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">After...at at the time, the time, the days passed one after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">There were...1t was a terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There were French resistance prisoners, from the French resistance who were made to...they were being made to walk all day long in leg chains and and there were random hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">There were other people in a in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> uh company that were that were caused to march everyday with a new pair of German military shoes because they wanted to...when they issued the shoes to the German soldiers they wanted the shoes to be worn for at least one day so these people had to march all day long, and it was just...1t was an awful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but after about a number of weeks, an announcement, an announcement was made that our group of about four hundred and fifty who were somehow identified as machine machine operators or or lathe (ph) operator specialists, was being shipped, was being sent to two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , one outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Now I...we just knew...I I must tell you we are told we are being shipped to two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I don't know that we knew at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I guess we knew that we...one group was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> and another group was being sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And the way it was done that orderly would say well we need seven lathe operators to go here and five uh drill press operators to go there and because they allowed it that way rather than saying you and you go there, people that had some connection with each other, either because they were from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or because they knew each other, managed to stay together, and they would just be assigned and we continued going to work and about four or five days later there was a list posted by number...all of us had numbers... had this number that I said, 107,081, and there was a list posted of the people that were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I originally was supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> and not that I had any knowledge of whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> is better or not, but the people that I knew from before the war and some of the people I knew for a long time were going there and I just wanted to stay with people on whom one could count as a little bit of support. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Well, I discovered that in the process of assembling the final list, there was some changes and about forty or so people were shifted and I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Another person that was shifted with me was a young man who had a cousin by the name of Joe Senga (ph) that was allowed to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I hope I'm not confusing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Some of us that was supposed to go was shipped here and this cousin said I want to go with my cousin because we're just cousins and that's most unusual among those few survivors that that there was their cousins or brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Well, this cousin said uh I don't know what fate has for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They assigned me here and I'm going to stay...I don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Well, anyway, after much ado and much suffering, Joe Senga and I changed uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He put my uniform with your number on the side and so on and I took his uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He told me his name and his date of birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He was incidentally born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> too, but he was eighteen and I was sixteen at that time and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> with his cousin...I'm sorry...he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> with his cousin and I, under his name, stayed with my friends and and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...fellow townspeople in that group that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Uh of that group of two hundred or twenty or forty that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , only one survived I found out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And all the others uh died and uh Senga who carried my name didn't make it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Again, one of those lucky incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">One of those fateful incidents where, you know, I really didn't know which one was better, and I did it, you know, just for reasons to please him and to go with my...the people I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Our group of some two hundred and twenty...I would guess about twenty-five, twenty-eight survived and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">None of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I...cemember I say twenty-five, twenty-eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Maybe it was thirty-two. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It was some small number survived and nevertheless I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I was sent to camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watenstedt</span> (ph) is the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was a camp of about twelve thousand prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Uh we were the first and only Jews, about two hundred and fifty of us and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was attached to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on, the time was passing, conditions were getting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">There was much less food. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The the guards were much more cruel and there was no clothing and anyway we we got there in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I was now Joseph Senga, had a new number and my number was 107,028. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I don't know why his number was smaller than mine and uh worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Very hard conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Kapos, which were the trustees, were very cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">They were...most of the people were uh from...well, there were no...very few Jews and people were dying like flies, either from hunger, from exhaustion. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I have seen people arrive and be there for two, three weeks and then unless they were really hustling and competing, if they were trying to be some how accommodating of all the others who but all the other prisoners who by that time were very aggressive and would try to steal your bread or steal your soup just to survive, not out of villainy (ph), or they wouldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">At one point there there were two French people brought in who I was told were priests or bishops and they were just overwhelmed by the misery they saw around and were willing to share their food and they lasted two weeks and I'm not making any judgment about it but that's how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">In January of...we got there in October...work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , try to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We had very little clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We got wooden shower shoes and very thin clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">In January of 1945 the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed by B-17's I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was a daylight bomb and it was on a Sunday and we worked all the time except Sunday afternoon was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And it was bombed on Sunday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Was completely destroyed and at that point, from that day on...well, anyway, from that day on we worked rebuilding the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , moving, building bricks, picking up pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was just tremendous feel of gloom (ph) and also that night, the night of the bombing, snow for the first time, so when we went to work it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We had no gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We had no socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We had no shoes and we just worked <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> moving bricks and moving uh moving uh stones and I have and uh this was the time when most of the people died, just from cold and exhaustion. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We would sleep two men to a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I remember sleeving...slee... sleeping with a young man whom I knew for about two, three years now whose name was Hoffenflack (ph) and at night when I woke up, he was dead, and I couldn't push him out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> so I just slept there the rest of the night, but he was dead just from cold and not eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Uh I need to go back for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I said that in January when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed...1in mid-December, the times were already very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Someone recognized that I have some artistic talent and assigned me to work for those kind of two weeks before Christmas in a uh carpentry uh <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in which uh toys were being made for the children of the guards, so I worked designing drawing horses and ducks and the carpenters would would uh cut it out and assemble it into something they could draw on a string and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">At one point one of the SS officers came in and said to me we need a star to put on top of our Christmas tree and design one and have it painted, but don't make it make a five-corner star because it's communist or a six-cornered star because it's Jewish, so I had to design an eight-corner star because uh that's how I knew how to do it, you know, because I just remembered that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">During that time when I work in the <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shop</span> I was getting some extra food which I shared with a friend of mine, someone by the name of , Julius , who was somebody I knew from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He was three years older than I was and he was with me and I was getting more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I was able to share it with him and uh then when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed out, I was no longer working in the <span class="BUILDING">carpentry store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was working...in <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shop</span> ...I was working carrying bricks and cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So was he, but he found in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> a a box of ration cards and remember at that ttme <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had food rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He found a box of ration cards and made some contact with uh with a Polish worker who was there who was willing to trade those ration cards for extra bread, and he was able to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Again, those special circumstances that allowed me to be drawing Christmas tree stars and have some food to share with him and then allowed him by accident to have access to some additional bread which he was able to share with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He shared with me because uh well, because we were friends I suppose and because he had enough for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But it was a very terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">There was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There was very little...there was no clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was cold, miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">The German guards were even more cruel and we would find in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> some old drapery material because they had...and we tried to either fashion gloves or vests or something and they would search us and if we had any gloves made out of drapery material or vests, they would take the take it away from us or we would find paper sacks from cement and try to use this as something to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They would also take it away from us and we marched to work every day and every night when we walked back we would have to carry fifty, sixty dead people who died during the uh during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That is how it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">People were just dying, just dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">There was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">People were just like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Uh those of us that survived uh again did the same thing and it it...there was no drama. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">There was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">No no great things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There was no special danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">There was no special mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">There was no...no one showed up to do anything good or bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We just had to survive, day to day, survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Finda piece of _ to tie around your shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Uh uh try to have a piece of paper around your body to keep warm and and avoid the German searching you and if uh if there was jobs being assigned, try to get to assigned to a job that was less exhausting than some other job, because it gave you a chance to live another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And uh early 1945...I would guess it was uh maybe in late February, March...we heard guns on the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Now we had no idea what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">By that time we didn't have any hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We didn't nurture any hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Of those two hundred and twenty or so of us that came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there were maybe forty, fifty alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We didn't nurture...I was...specifically, I was sinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There was in...there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> a condition called mussulman and I don't know what it comes from, but these were people who was...whose...who were so physically and mentally deteriorated that they no longer cared about survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They kind of like wandered or staggered around. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They usually live for a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I was approaching that condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Times I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I and I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I know that and I remember talking to some people and saying I don't know if I can manage it another week or two, and they were saying come on...even though they were in the same condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Even though some of them that said to me come on, you know, try, try...didn't make it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Anyway, in early March...I'm estimating now...there were guns on the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">The Germans again put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and after a very long and very deadly journey uh we arrived in a...in the middle of the night someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We were made to get out of out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there were these mountains of bones, human bones, and it was kind of like something that an abstract picture of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> ...just big piles of human bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Turned out it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> (ph), which is a Mecklenberg (ph) which was a major, primarily a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span> for men and uh we were kept there for two weeks, really doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Sitting in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Uh all organization started breaking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">For example, when there was a distribution of slices of bread and they would they would have a ba...a basket of slices of bread and which you get one slice of bread a day and the the kapos who would hand it out would hand it out and as the people pushed, they would turn over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> and everybody would attack it and grab it and and our belief was that the kapos did it because they kept some of the bread for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They didn't have enough to to give each one of us a slice of bread, so then those that are a little bit stronger managed to have two pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Those that were either not in position or were weaker would die that day or the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I remember the sun was shining and I was kind of wandering around and came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we had lice and we were dirty and we were just terrible and I came by a <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw my image in a window pane and I didn't recognize myself, and I saw that I was a mussulman already. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I saw that I was not making it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">After about three weeks in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and shipped us someplace else and when we arrived there we discovered that the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that incidentally was liberated by the 82nd Airborne Division and if one reads Gavin's (ph) book uh Road to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in the last chapter he talks about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he says something that I don't remember...that you could smell that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before you saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I don't remember any obvious smells. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But was half finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We slept on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Dead bodies all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">People were eating the dead bodies and uh everyone who sur...wanted to survive would do whatever one had to do to to eat uh whatever was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Uh more people were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There were just mountains of dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They didn't bury them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was late in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was April of...late April of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Of our group there were just a few, but there were some other Jews now by then there and then on May Ist, and I know the date in retrospect of course...on May Ist, we were all told to get in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was this camp was assembled and we were all told to get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We all were marched in a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I made the first first risky thing I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">When we were when we were assembled and were informed that we are leaving, they asked those who cannot walk will go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The others will march. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Those that cannot...that can walk step forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">My head was hurting me and I couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But it turned out they put us all on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so that fact that I accepted now, that being singled out, showing some weakness that I had fought for three years to prevent, really didn't harm me. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We were put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all night long and confined hundred, hundred and twenty people to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> , and there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> and in the morning they made us walk out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and stand there between the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was and the <span class="DLF">front fence</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The the way it was arranged the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> has two pieces, two <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was a camp of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There were <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and on the other side of the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> there was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the guards lived, so we were there and uh my...I don't know...maybe four thousand prisoners although there was lot of death later on, and they said all Jews step forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I mean I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Uh some of the...well, of course this was not announced the way they announce it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It was announced...it was de...demanded with threat and with violence and some of the non-Jewish prisoners started pointing us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It was possible for us to be identified because we would have a red triangle showing that we are political, but there were little three yellow corners behind it to make that into a star of David and in all that tumult and confusion...this was now May 2nd...there was a...I'm again coming to an emotional time...there was a gunshot and we all looked down the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> which was kind of like a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> cut in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and in May there were...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were already green and far away there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It looked kind of like a prehistoric monster with smoke coming out of it and was maybe a mile away, but the Germans just opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , pushed us all in, and we were still guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">There were still guards in the in the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and they kept shooting at random at uh at the ca...at the prisoners and one had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide behind a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> not to be exposed to line of fire and uh then they took the German trustees out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And we were kind of alone and I remember finding someplace three potatoes, because they...whatever supplies there were were no longer guarded by the German trustees, by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , and cooking those three potatoes in the fire, baking and making little fires...others did it too...a little fire behind...and it was afternoon and then I hear noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">People running and shouting and I really didn't want to leave the three potatoes but I was concerned that maybe something bad is happening, and I was still, had sufficient instinct for survival that I needed to know what's happening. __ </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I couldn't walk very well and my head hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I and I I suppose maybe I was stimulated by that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and which obviously was a friendly one, or at least unfriendly to the Germans, so I ran to see what all these people were running and there were Americans. (</span><span class="sentence" id="543">Crying) They were soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">There was a patrol of 82nd Airborne soldiers inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> standing among these mountains of bodies and thousand or two thousand crazy prisoners jumping and hugging each other and kissing each other and uh I really didn't feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I didn't know what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They were overwhelmed and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was a patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They were not going to...oh yes, when they...when we jumped and screamed and saw the Americans, we looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There were no guards in the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , and when the Americans left, when those...when the patrol of six or seven soldiers left, and we...some of us...people continued still dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There were lots of people that were dying laying around and some people started leaving and me and five friends, , the one that I mentioned before , and another was a man I knew from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who was an older brother of that young man back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who had a certificate on his on his identification paper that he had some physical ailment and should be excused...we decided based on the stories we heard from the...from our parents on what happened in the first war when the Russians and the Austrians keep moving back and forth, so the Americans left and the Germans may be coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We really didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">We left at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We jumped...the <span class="DLF">door</span> , <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open and the five of us just left, went went walking in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and hiding over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">At one point we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called that was still in German hands and we hid in a little <span class="BUILDING">paint store</span> and that night the Americans came and I was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I didn't try very hard to...1 was seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I tried very hard to write a letter to my aunt and uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I didn't know their address anymore because among the things that I left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> with the photographs was the address of my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I knew that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I knew that there was MD attached to his name and I didn't know exactly what it meant or I knew that he was a physician and uh needless to say I finally got through to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">None of them...I I I asked every soldier, American or English, to send a letter for me and none of the letters arrived but one of the GI's came back and brought a letter with him and looked him up in the phone book in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and called him and uh I just you know, I made contact with relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I discovered that no one else has survived, none of my family, and the part of Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where I was liberated, became...was destined to become the eastern, the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , now part of eastern rather than East, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and people that were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and brought us out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the <span class="DLF">Russian's lines</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The Russians didn't want to accept us that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I don't know if that would have made any difference in my life, but at least they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So then the British picked us up and took us in a on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> (ph) was pronounced in English which was right across the <span class="DLF">line</span> between the English and the <span class="REGION">Russian zones</span> where I stayed and waited to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The only thing that I have from those days is a photograph of myself, how I looked uh about three or four months after I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I have no other photographs of of anyone else, but that...and when the war was over there was some already institutional things started and one needed papers and so I went to a photographer and had a picture taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">As you can see...I think there is a date on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The date is...OK...here we're looking...1 st June of '45 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> which would be a month after I was liberated and being seventeen and having access to food which the American soldiers around were kind enough to share with us, I was recovering. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I mean my hair started growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Let me just finish the story very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I I stayed in Europe in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It took that long to get uh...I had to make the arrangements for for to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">My relatives sponsored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in...October 2nd, 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I...
QUESTION:  Could you, George, could you tell us a little bit about what your life was like for the two years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , what you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And did you do some of your art work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Well, uh yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I stayed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">One was kind of abandoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Many of the Jewish, my Jewish friends, went to to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time...uh illegal but arrangements were being made by the Brichah for people to to somehow smuggle themselves into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I, who had already made commit...made contact with my relatives or who were making arrangements for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ...there was still hope that my brother would show up somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I made a decision to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there was really nothing done for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I was just a young man of seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">There was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There was...I needed dental work and there were no dentists and I was kind of like sitting around and uh to occupy myself or to maybe to to give give vent to some emotional needs I had I started painting and I painted some pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Some of them were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Some of them I brought with me uh to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and have given to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> for whatever it's worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Clearly they are just my own images of what I remembered or what I thought, and and otherwise they were kind of wasted two years, waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">There were no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">You know, I I was uh many of the people to survive were getting involved in in <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and some illegal activities which I didn't want to do because I was afraid that I would be tainted somehow and not be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> so it was a time of uh waiting, of growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">You know, I was...nevertheless I was influenced by that kind of a illegal illegal activities that were taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They were not activities of violence or villainy. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They were activities of violating some economic rules, smuggling, dealing with the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , finding cigarettes and selling them for this and that and I and in order to be...was affected by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I'm saying this because when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and moved with my uncle who was a successful physician, who had great uh had friends who were musicians in the New York Symphony and who had candles at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> and friends _, it was a very difficult transition for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">A wonderful but a difficult transition. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">In the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I worked as a delivery boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the afternoon to learn how to repair <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television sets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night to learn English, one of those typical classical things where you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">There was a book whose name I now don't remember about it, don't remember any more uh to and was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at uh George Washington High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> at night to study English. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">After a year of doing that and learning how to repair <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television sets</span> , I got a job as a television repairman and then another year later or a year and a half, I was drafted in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I served two years in the Signal Corps with a honorable discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">This was during the Korean War, but this was a police action rather than a war so some of the provisions for citizenship didn't apply and I had to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for two years, for five years so in March of '53 I was discharged from the army and became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I was still in the army when I became a citizen and one of the questions that the judge asked of me was whether I if called upon I'd be willing to serve in the United States Armed Forces and I was wearing my uniform which was kind of funny and then in March of '53 I was uh married to my present wife, who to...to my present wife and uh shortly got a job and shortly thereafter taking advantage of my GI bill uh I went to <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> at night uh because I couldn't afford to go during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The GI bill just paid for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I received my Bachelor's Degree in Physics and Magna Cum Laude in five years at night and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , continued in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and received a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I worked in a re...worked for industry and then worked for a <span class="BUILDING">government lab</span> and in uh mid-sixties when McNamara was uh the Secretary of Defense, I was asked to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and join his staff as one of those whatever they were called at that time... McNamara's raiders or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I spent about ten, twelve years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in the in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the last eight years as Director of Defense Communications Systems uh which required me to testify before various committees and so on and then about and then I went back to industry and I'm now a an executive in an <span class="BUILDING">aerospace company</span> and still working. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Uh I'm still married to my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We still still love each other and we have three children who are married and well, and four grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I tried not to think about the war and tried to live my life as if the war never happened, even though I recognize that I am tainted by that fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">That's my story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Thank you very much. (</span><span class="sentence" id="614">Pause) Do you want some water? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Can you tell me, with the benefit of hindsight, what effect that you feel the war has had on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Well, obviously it's most difficult for me to judge myself but I think uh it has had definite effects. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I for example never cry when I'm sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I only cry when I'm happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And you have maybe observed it here, that I was emotional remembering good things like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> or the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I suppose I'm too protective of my children and giving them what is commonly known as survivor children syndrome. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Uh there are facts, clearly there are facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Uh my willingness to accept risk in life is diminished by my war time experiences and therefore I have tended to be, to stay employed with the same company or the same organization longer than I should have because I think that uh the war time experience when I was very young somehow conditioned me to to avoid risk and avoid and avoid uh maybe taking initiatives more than I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But it's difficult for me to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I am sure that there are facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I am sure that people who know me can see it much better than I can, SO...
QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Glad to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION END OF INTERVIEW </span>
