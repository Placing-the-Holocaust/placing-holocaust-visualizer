QUESTION:  Let’s just get your birth date also, your date of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Date of birth, September 30, 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">In 1933 I was a <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> pupil going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruvna</span> in <span class="REGION">Polish Ukraine area</span> which was called in Polish Woin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  This was <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  That was <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I lived there with my father, my mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was a military career officer who had fantastic talent in organizing orchestra bands or <span class="BUILDING">amateur theaters</span> anywhere we went and because of being military person he was rotated on his duty from one _ <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, therefore we recognized and lived in many, many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> on the <span class="DLF">eastern Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was comparing with American organization was similar to FBI.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  So it was an investigative branch of the...
ANSWER:  An investigative counterespionage, army counter-espionage intelligence service. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So in 1935 after graduating from <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , my father was transferred to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruvna</span> by name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kostopol</span> which is now in <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And he didn’t want me to waste time on learning Ukrainian language and therefore he brought me to my grandmother’s place, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> where I was born and I enrolled to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which 1s <span class="BUILDING">Polish high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Was it a special <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> or just general studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  No, it was general studies, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And how different and how more informative <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> was compared with <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> , then you know yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> in first and second year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and then I joined my father who requested transfer to <span class="REGION">area</span> where he could have also <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he received <span class="REGION">Wilno district</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> now is capitol of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> but 1t was Polish and near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka Poyeto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So I completed <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the third and fourth year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> ..
QUESTION:  Your whole family was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  And my family was there, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Did you have a particular subject that was most interesting to you at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  All subjects were dictated by national education system and therefore the beauty of this was that no matter where anybody from military family or any other the child was transferred from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another at this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you found exactly the same program in every subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we had twelve subjects including geography that in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> kids don’t even know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington D.C.</span> 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  You took languages there and German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  In order to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">Polish high school</span> you had to know two foreign languages and one classic. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So I had German and French and Latin language as classic. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So in 1939 I should have started Liceum. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Liceum was approximately corresponding with <span class="BUILDING">American college</span> , first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  That’s a generic name, Liceum?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Liceum, L-I-C-E-U-M.
QUESTION:  Oh, like the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Like the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So when war broke out, September 1, that was our first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And immediately after the ceremony we started digging <span class="DLF">trenches</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Did they tell you why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, we knew immediately that war broke out and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , at four o’clock I understand in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What were these <span class="DLF">trenches</span> like that you were digging?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  They were just like in the <span class="DLF">frontlines</span> , any action, any military action in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were about seven feet deep covered with some heavy materials and then covered with topsoil. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So from the top, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> you couldn’t see it, camouflaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  This was still in the Wilno district you were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Yeah, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was, on the <span class="REGION">high school territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Well so you could see that we couldn’t proceed with our lessons because the action, Germans, were approaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> almost every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Where was your father, was he mobilized to go someplace else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  No, my father was still with us until September 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">On September 17 the <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> according to agreement with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And they gave us the final blow in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So we didn’t know how they would behave entering <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> so my father took us, my sister, mother, myself, took us with him on the evacuation trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">On our way there we have seen already preparations of Polish troops to fight the approaching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet tanks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  But the Polish army was relatively weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Weak, yes, and it was already in very much in disastrous situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Therefore, he left us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> with his friends and went with his group of agents he said to headquarter, I believe, to headquarter, and I have never seen him again until after war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So as I understand they crossed the <span class="DLF">Lithuanian border</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was for a few more days free, and when the Russians came, all these Polish military personnel was taken by the Russians and sent to various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Who were you staying with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , you said they were friends of your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Friends of my father, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Military friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Military friends from World War 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then the Soviets ordered all people should return to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And after a few weeks they ordered all students return to their classes, but because of the extra-curriculum given by Russians in Russian language in Communist history, in party Communist history, we were taken one year back -- because they told us we complete our education as Communists after two years of indoctrination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  So you were in classes learning Russian now and Soviet propaganda?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Yes and Soviet Communist Party history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  How did you personally feel about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, you had absolutely nothing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You tolerated but you were definitely disgusted about this and we were trying to make some sort of ironic remarks all the time during the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But our teachers were army officers and they were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  They pretty much replaced teachers that were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  So all your other studies went by the wayside?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No, other studies, a few of our teachers escaped, and whoever escaped was replaced by the army teachers, Russian army teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Well I attended Communist classes until January 1“, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That was if somebody still is altve could remember, we had the worst, the strongest, the coldest winter of my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The temperature very often was dropped to minus 40 degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And during the night like that, with of course certain agreement with my mother, I decided to escape to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I went to the last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> before the borderline between Russian occupation zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and German occupation zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Why did you want to escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">What was your goal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Good question, because they started to arresting all Polish intelligent family members such as doctors, lawyers, former police department members.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So clearly your father if he were there would have been a target.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yeah, and I would be a target, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So I decided to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  That was in January?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  That was January 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Taking advantage of -- they gave us two weeks vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So arriving to this last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> I had to go about five miles on foot with a group of some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They thought I know more about the location of the <span class="DLF">border line</span> than themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I led them directly to the <span class="BUILDING">guards building</span> and when we started running away, they noticed us and they started shooting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  These were the Russian guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Russian guards and I was caught first time when I tried to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And as penalty they placed us in the brick outhouse in the lower level where I had to stand in excrement, human excrement up to my knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I couldn’t kneel. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I couldn’t relax, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I had to stand there for three days before they took us out and they told us, now go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> and you should study because you are a young student and you will be a good Consumer (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Then I cried but I had to try again. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So with my second try, instead of turning left, I turned right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Did you go all the way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  NO, NO, NO, NO. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Right after this maybe I went two kilometers towards the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then I turned sideways when I noticed, because that was during the night, I noticed they couldn’t see me anymore and I tried again, with the help, of course, of one guy who was also crossing not the first trme. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he helped me out and I found myself on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">People on the borderline were very wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They fed me, they washed me a little bit, because I stunk like a beaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And after a few hours I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> because I thought my grandmother 1s still in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">When I arrived there I only met my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">My grandmother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So between January of 1940 -- oh while reaching the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , I sent a message to my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> a friend who was leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> because he had a family over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Was he crossing from the <span class="REGION">German side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  He was crossing from the <span class="REGION">German side</span> to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I give him description how I crossed and I urged them also to try to come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">You see the difference between <span class="REGION">Russian occupational zone</span> and German was that they were both death enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">However, on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> you could at least dress as a civilized people. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You could use your tie, you could use your hat, you could use your nice shirt, versus looking like a peasant all the time and be completely as a savage looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So this is, you should remember, this is the reason why so many people couldn’t stand Communists because that was hypocrisy to the highest extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Now what struck me first on my arrival to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> that Jewish people, they were wearing the armbands with the Star of David and they had to take hats off and step aside before every German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So you could see that that was horrible experience right from the start. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I was wondering right then how long I would be safe in this <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Did anybody ever check your documents at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  No, No, nobody...
QUESTION:  Once you were there they just assumed.....
ANSWER:  Yeah, once you were there.....It took me one month to take <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , Turkish bath every day in order to get rid of the smell I absorbed sitting in that <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Well, I started working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> first at the construction to clean, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> was also bombed during the war and there were many <span class="BUILDING">masonry buildings</span> that required removal. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And the break was the price of gold so we were cleaning from the mortar, we were cleaning every brick and...
QUESTION:  How would you clean the mortar off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  With chisels, and once you cleaned a thousand bricks a day, you had good pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And so I worked there, but it was too hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So after two months, that was about March, in March I met one friend who suggested to me we should open photographic business because Germans were taking pictures of all the <span class="BUILDING">Polish ruins</span> and Polish various monuments and everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Had the Germans assigned you to that task of cleaning up the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  No, no that was private. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was private Polish company.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Did you have to clean a thousand a day to get paid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  But if you cleaned a thousand you would get reasonable pay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yeah, you could work two days or three days but you were paid for one thousand bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I went in business developing pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I knew this because we had our own <span class="INT_SPACE">darkroom</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  In your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  In my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , yeah, so I was photographing bugs since I was nine years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  You had a camera?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  I had camera, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So it was easy for me and I was making good prints and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">That’s why we had fantastic business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did you actually have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  We had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , yeah, we had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in a half demolished <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , but it was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  That’s extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">What about getting supplies? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Was it relatively...
ANSWER:  The Germans were giving you supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The Germans were bringing supplies to your <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Therefore, you were allowed to charge them just for your labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They were giving you prices for every print, every enlargement, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Do you remember developing anything especially interesting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Oh we collected some nice, yeah, they were very fond of taking pictures of the hanging ceremony and we had quite a bit of collection of German photographers indicating the executions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Were these Jews mostly that they hung?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  No, no, anybody who was against them who was caught doing something that they -- for everything, as you know maybe, everything was death penalty, no matter what you did, against the Reich it was death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now, my mother and sister arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in May 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They had also tremendous, tremendous difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They were separated for 48 hours during their trip and my mother thought that they kidnapped my sister because she was only, at that time, maybe twelve years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Were you living with your aunt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  I was living with my aunt, yeah, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  And that’s where the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> , yeah, before my mother and sister arrtved. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When my mother and sister arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> she sold everything what we had, possibly whatever was available and in their clothing and various pieces of undergarments se sewed in all the bank notes, high bank notes of one thousand zloty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  So we collected, it was a very nice sum, when we tear off all these garment we found quite a nice sum of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And that was the last day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to exchange the old Polish money into the general government, they were called general government money. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And we decided to open a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> is Minsk Mazowiecki and we decided to go back to our first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family town</span> when everybody knew us and we knew that if something goes wrong, we will get help. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And therefore the first try was to open a regular <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk Mazowiecki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And since the only place for the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> didn’t go so well, so therefore my mother obtained somehow lease of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And she decided to change from <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> to <span class="BUILDING">delicatessen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we had fantastic business. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We had fantastic business and I could start attending various classes and getting my education because as you know, once Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they liquidated all <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">lyceums</span> , <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Only the <span class="BUILDING">grammar schools</span> were open because they told us that we are designated as labor force only.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Right, so all you need 1s a certain level of education.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER: <span class="INT_SPACE"> Group cell</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I was already in the <span class="INT_SPACE">Transport floor</span> so absorbed most of the smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Then you could see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from that <span class="DLF">window</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Yes, you could see the <span class="DLF">streets</span> also, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> on one hand and some individuals shooting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> from another end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The smoke was still on when they took us to a transport and we arrived to the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw freight station</span> and placed eighty prisoners in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Total of transport was 1,200 prisoners.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Cattle cars</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">One more thing that I should mention because it was significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Was adding to our tortures was the amount of bedbugs that was eating you alive during the night and you couldn’t escape because when you even slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> providing every leg of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> into a pail of water, they were crawling on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and then on the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and dropping on your body from the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It was completely impossible to fight them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  They give you some food within the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  Yes, you were getting very small amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Well now things were rolling very fast now because between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piajkov</span> the very next big <span class="BUILDING">station</span> going west from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> few guys who worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poviak</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , they somehow smuggled hand drill at their body so when I found myself with them in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , with small <span class="DLF">holes</span> they drill through a few planks, wooden planks, removed it from the top and you could slide down and upward between the channels, steel channels there were wooden planks.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  No, that was side, between the <span class="DLF">buffers</span> , between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , parallel with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And they removed few planks, enough for human body to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They just placed themselves nicely under the <span class="DLF">buffers</span> and one after another started escaping because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caboose</span> where the soldiers were never expected first somebody might escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They were playing cards or something, did not paying attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So the first few, seven only, were able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I was also in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to escape but the first shot was fired as noticed them running away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  This was daytime?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Daytime, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And their nice situation was that the machinist were appalled so he rode the engine for another maybe half a mile before he stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So they had enough <span class="REGION">area</span> to be separated from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so they didn’t bother to chase them. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">But all the madness they concentrated on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where we were in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  Right, somebody was going to suffer for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Right, so when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, the first SS jumped on the buffer, taking advantage of this open <span class="NPIP">spot</span> through which they escaped and he emptied entire magazine of the machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So he killed two guys and he wounded about five guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I heard only whistle above my head so for the first time I had a barrel of the gun facing against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That was the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Immediately they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they took us all out and it was some small how to say, it’s not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , it’s not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  So it was a full days journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Full day journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And the soldiers were still mad at us and they were wounding people with bayonets pushing us between the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , <span class="DLF">railroad platform</span> and the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was also quite an <span class="REGION">area</span> , maybe half a kilometer or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So during this small distance they still had a chance to wound few prisoners with their bayonet. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">When we arrived there nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We were in such a disarray and tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The very next morning they told us to undress.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Where did they hold you overnight?</span></p>

From now on don’t forget that you are not a man you are only a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I think that was quite characteristic. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I never forgot this because I realized that I was only a number from now on. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">After two weeks being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ..
QUESTION:  Were you pretty much idle at that time, they weren’t working you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Pretend I am sick, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So one guard and me walked from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and when I arrived I met immediately I saw my cousin but he told me pretend that we don’t know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He placed me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I was there for three days only and then remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but still since I did not have two weeks quarantine that was required for all newcomers we were called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzuganga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tsugang</span> is the new arrival.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Cold, cold, yeah, fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I was there not quite two weeks as on quarantine because I fainted in the next week or so standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for Appell and when I was first time, I met these two gentlemen from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Their names just to record them I have to mention Jan Musdorf and Oleg Guretsky and they saved my life because when I went to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the second time I really had pneumonia in full swing with pleurisy, water in my lungs, completely flooded, and if not for care of these two guys I wouldn’t live today. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Unfortunately I must tell you that one of them, Jan Musdorf, was executed as a member of the Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Somebody squealed when he was in camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he was executed together with other Polish patriots at the end of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  With pneumonia did you go back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  No, I was recuperating and my friends since my cousin was an old prisoner, since June of 1940, he had many, many friends, and therefore they respected old prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was kept in this <span class="DLF">block</span> where there were after illness you had to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Usually you were staying one week in <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> SS doctor was coming and sending you to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> immediately as an Arbeit Shoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Arbeit Shoy means afraid of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So you had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That’s why I was always hiding, always hiding, lucky to have friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  You stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Yeah, and now during my presence there, that was summer of ’43, another atrocity occurred that could indicate what kind of inhuman treatment you could expect from the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They executed first thirteen members of the surveying group that one of them escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Thirteen were executed at <span class="DLF">Black Wall</span> on Block number eleventh and twelve remaining after one month just as an example that no one should even think about escaping, they hung them in front of all of us, twelve members of the surveying group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  So one was shot and the rest were...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Thirteen were shot and twelve were hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">That was July 17 of 1943, the execution took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  So they made all the other prisoners come out and watch this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  And watch yeah, and they were hung in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They were hung there for at least three days before the bodies were taken away and gallows was removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And while I was on that -- I received a red point which meant in the distinction of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp meant</span> he’s not allowed to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp because</span> they called us Flukfergocht which means suspected of any escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I received this probably because the Gestapo had me from the first, my first escape from the <span class="DLF">Skarasheska Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And maybe all the guys who were with me in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was carrying us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  It was approximately one- inch diameter that was red on white piece of cloth and here were letters IL.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  So it looked something like a Japanese flag?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Like a Japanese flag, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So my cousin said to me, Michael, you will live about two weeks, that’s all, because that was the approximate time elapsing between.....they didn’t want to keep the Im Lager, the Red Points in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">You could be shot after six o’clock when you were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">After working hours when you were walking in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> SS soldiers were trying to experiment or exercise their aim at the points and they were shooting at you like to a rabbit. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So immediately after being discharged from quarantine I started working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I was so good at folding the SS shirts that they gave me the <span class="INT_SPACE">storeroom</span> to take care of, otherwise I had to keep every SS guys names inside my notebook and receiving the dirty clothes and giving them back already washed and cleaned and pressed and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So it was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">That happened until December | of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They decided to collect all the Red Point guys and put them to <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So I was taken to <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> which was known from the executions and that was the final stage of your -- like the <span class="DLF">death row</span> or the final <span class="DLF">alley</span> before they executed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So you imagine how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And that was the time when new commanding officer of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> arrived and this blood thirsty son-of-a-bitch was replaced by name of Liebehenstetshen (probably Arthur Liebehenschel) or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He, would you believe, he said that during his presence there would be no more executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So I was saved again but he concentrated all these guys who were on the black list and he sent us to another trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  How long were you held in <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  From December | to February 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we had fantastic weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">There was no more than about 35, 38 degrees, no lower, and we arrived to the elevation of 900 meters which 1s over 2700 feet above sea level and with six feet of snow on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , cold as <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and we were only dressed in thin German prisoner uniforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  They took you by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Oh yes, the same thing, and we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kemnitz</span> , I remember, <span class="BUILDING">station</span> all the way around <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They didn’t go through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , all the way around <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> is situated in <span class="REGION">Northern Bavaria</span> close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weiden</span> and that was -- we didn’t know why we are there but we started working on the Shtassenbau Commando, two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> which we were about to cut to certain level and fill the <span class="DLF">gap</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> to create a <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">A few guys died at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We had two Jewish friends, prisoners, with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They killed one by name of Blum. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He was famous in Jewish society in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Plus two additional guys that they told us they would be transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they have additional Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> we had no Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So I had, there were many stories I could tell you about my presence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg camp</span> but that was camp that I finally transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">Messerschmitt factory</span> that they had in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We were not afraid of any air raids or anything because it was in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Isn’t the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  No <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">granite mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I was there till the end, which means till April of 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  So most of your time there was spent working in the <span class="BUILDING">Messerschmitt factory</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="528">First you built the <span class="DLF">roads</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  First we built the <span class="DLF">roads</span> for the first two weeks and then they called all carpenters and good thing that I said that I am carpenter. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">He look at my hands and he slapped me and he says you son-of-a-bitch, you telling me that these are carpenter’s hands and I said well I was a student before I was arrested and I didn’t have hard work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> so I couldn’t have any calluses on my hands, however, I am acquainted with all the carpenter’s tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He says okay then we take you but if you show me any ignorance to handling the equipment I will kill you personally he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Is this a kapo or an SS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  That was an SS officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So I was directed to the Killer Fur Klidem for Messerschmitt which was a small aluminum box that my duty was -- it’s on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">conveyer</span> -- and I had to make approximately sixty holes in one minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  You had to drill them in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Drill them in, yeah, through the dzig. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So many guys were afraid to break the bits. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Once you broke the bit you got 25 lashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I became famous because I learned how to sharpen the bits and to work enough to be allowed to break them. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">You had to perform already a certain work with every bit before you could break it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So after that on May first 1944 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> they allowed us to play ball for the first time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  Were you liberated just one morning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Yes I was liberated on the third day of our evacuation march. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Was a beautiful, beautiful, never to forget situation, because we were concentrated on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and we have seen on the other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , we have seen first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> and together with us there were Soviet army members who jumped on the Ukrainian SS guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They shot them, killed them instantly and with the guns they were started moving toward the American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Since that was some kind of horseshoe area we were trying to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> and then come up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and making ourselves a short cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And when we were, we were there three of us, we found a group of SS soldiers armed to their teeth and we almost got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It’s unbelievable, right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You sense you had freedom in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and you could be killed at the last moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">That was my fourth time when I faced the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And good thing that my friend spoke German and then we said we are Germans from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So he said only as Germans don’t tell them that we are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">My luck was that when I arrived to the first group of the Yanks, the commanding officer I think of the first division of the Third Army and most of them were Poles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , <span class="REGION">New York area</span> and almost every second spoke Polish, broken Polish, but they knew Polish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So I told him in Polish who we met on our way here. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So he said okay you will see what’s going to happen and they shot immediately first warning like a rocket down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">After a few moments lower white flag arrived at the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , just like <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> or something like that and he said look what’s gonna happen now. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> maybe a dozen of them from all around the <span class="REGION">area</span> they started shooting everything they could reach.</span></p>
