<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  In what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  It’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Misucheva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It’s 80 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It’s near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I -- I found the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it was just -- just incredible to g -- relive to s -- wi-with the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And with her, wh-when they -- in -- was in 1945, he ha -- it was around March, we -- they were evacuating all the people from the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we sailed with her and we were told -- she told us -- this is the story that she said, that if -- we didn’t want to go with her, but if we didn’t that they would let out the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> , they’re letting the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> out and flooding the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> , which is a large <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And so we left and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And as soon as we went into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , we were torpedoed, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> torpedoed. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And we were -- I don’t know how long I was in the -- in the -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You know, it’s the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> there, Atlantic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> sank that we started out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  And the -- then, from there, they took us with a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , all the G-Germans -- this was, you know, now it’s <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but at that time it was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they took us to the - to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , they put us in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Was it the Germans who took you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Yeah, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But they didn’t know we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They were -- took us with Mrs. Unstrom, but they picked up all the people and they took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They put us in a big <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">and we could go out now, for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We could go out and - as long as we came back by dusk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Was this like a -- a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called -- the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Svininga</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And it was very interesting, there was a trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , because we - well, I don’t know, do you want me to talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Well, when we came to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , on May fifth, 1945, Ill never forget the day we were liberated, the war was over, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so I was only maybe five weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before liberation, we didn’t do anything, we were just -- could go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We could -- had to stay in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And we were all in this big auditortum and I remember one day we were walking, my sister and I and there was a woman working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we asked her, “Are there any Jews here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And she said, “When you Germans --” she thought we were Germans -- “When you Germans are going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the Jews will come back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the Christmas trees were still in the <span class="BUILDING">people’s homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So we knew it was around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We didn’t know exactly the dates and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day- my sister was so sick with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">By then, already, my mother was taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I was with her inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and that, you have that, I’m sure, on the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Because the mo- most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that’s why I was back a couple of times to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So we -- my sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, “I can’t go on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She was -- she had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Just right then, she had gotten typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I kept saying, “We will live, we will live.” </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> opened up and the bombs started to fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I had no energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I just fell into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">She was holding me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I don’t know who was holding who, we were all three. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we saw a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we walked across the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And the woman opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And that’s where they took all the people, to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they gave us some food and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we stayed there a couple of hours, til night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl and clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Why she did it -- you know, my sister always says, “You gave -- give that woman credit that she saved our lives.” </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I said, “Yeah, because if she hadn’t taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn’t told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives.” </span><span class="sentence" id="122">What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so, anyways, we went with this so -- Russian guy and he said, “I’m not taking you to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What I’m going to do 1s -- is I’m going to -- I’m going to take you to the nearest <span class="NPIP">point</span> where it’s frozen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It’s called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it’s the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and we were following him. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And he said to call on all our force. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If it’s wet, we will drown, because that means that the ice is broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we should do it at night so nobody detect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And all night long, we were crawling across. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Th-They just filmed it and the film of there, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And we got across on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and he told us to go to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should say we are not Jewish, we should say --
QUESTION:  What <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And what language were you speaking?</span></p>
