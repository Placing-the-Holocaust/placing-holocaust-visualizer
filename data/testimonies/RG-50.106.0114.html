QUESTION:  And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  In [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> on September 29", 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about your childhood and your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Who made up the members of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My father, Henry K. Peterson was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Mother, Laura May Peterson. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I had two — two others, my older sister Josephine, who was 11 years older than I, and my brother Robert, nine years older than I.
QUESTION:  And you spent your childhood in this one <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Exactly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What were your interests as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Thad, oh I think a variety of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">One thing I think Mother and Dad encouraged a lot of reading, we did a lot of reading at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The usual childhood sports, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I think beyond that also Mother and Dad encouraged collections of April 6, 1999 things. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Stamp collections, that sort of thing basically that was of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Music was always a part of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Mother sang beautifully and she played the piano, we had that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Interestingly too at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I think though, we had quite a bit — because on my father’s side, Danish background, as the name indicates. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">On my mother’s side the family went way back from New England Yankee people. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So on Dad’s side we would have my grandparents who lived just a block away, we'd be often times in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We learned little bit of Danish, used some Danish in the <span class="BUILDING">home place</span> , and my father had not spoken English until he was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">On Mother’s side we had a lot of Civil War background because she had three uncles who were in the Civil War. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of that sort of thing basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So there was a kind of a developing interest of history as well too, during that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  What kind of physical condition were you in? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Were you a healthy child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Oh I had the usual, I think, childhood diseases basically and the scrapes and bruises, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But no, nothing unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">It was — it was a good — good childhood, healthy-wise, you bet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  And were you small for your age or tall for your age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Right about average I would think, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think average.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And did you have any religious training? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">April 6, 1999
ANSWER:  We were Baptists. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The Baptist persuasion is that there is no baptism until you reach what 1s called the age of believer. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I was baptized when I was nine years old after some instruction, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And of course in the <span class="BUILDING">Baptist church</span> that’s by immersion. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Mother — D-Dad was very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Not only his profession but in community life and religious life as well too. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He’d been the past president of the Iowa Baptist Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Mother was even a stronger Baptist than he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She was what was called a deep water, loud shouting Baptist and she enjoyed the reli — so we had — we had a— a good — good — good religious background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Did you have many friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Were you a social child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Neighborhood friends, quite a few of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> quote gangs, end quote, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then farther along in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we lived just within a — oh, a block or so of [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I attended, and we had a lot of friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I — I think so, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Was your family a very emotional family? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Did they encourage you as a boy to show your emotions, or to keep them in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  There was never direct lect — any — any limitation of — of showing emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Dad was quite serious just by his demeanor basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Mother — Mother had more expression I think basically and she enjoyed things more. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She was a—a-—a delightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Dad, as I say, was more April 6, 1999 serious, but he was a very, very, very fine person. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And looking back, too, in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of encouragement of motivation to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Dad was very active community-wise and he urged all of us to — to be involved in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> activities, other activities as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we’re almost rather like two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My — 1n the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother nine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much younger, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So I— they were up and growing, my — my sister Josephine, brother Robert, they were kind of on a different level by the time I was — I came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> quite a bit myself, in those later years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  When did you start becoming aware of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young, because Mother’s two spinster sisters had both been to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My Aunt Agnes had — had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a number of times and studied there. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Aunt Belle had been with her also. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt — Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I’m speaking now April 6, 1999 of — of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">News-wise, later though, because it wasn’t of course until I was getting into later <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> that the world news became more and more important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Did your parents talk that over with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">How aware were you of the situation getting worse in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  We were aware because first of all we had the “Des Moines Register,” the state paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We had radio news basically as well, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So I think probably as — as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  What was your personal reaction when — in September ’39? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the — the war that — the word had come that — that of course as we remember, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had moved into the — in-into — into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , and then that the British gave the ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that they were given ultimatum, we have rece — [indecipherable] undertaking, so April 6, 1999 we’re therefore at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too, but I-I think — I think maybe — maybe Dad was more evident about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And you were in what grade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in — I’d bega — I began <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a five year old in 1930, so I— I would have been about the eighth or ninth grade at that time, or in that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Did you feel threatened at all by that news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Not really, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That came a bit later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Okay, so you continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  And your life did not change immediately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Correct, correct, but the real — the real change came in April of 1940, the next spring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war, nothing happening basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But it was in April, the next April, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> moved into first <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and then the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span> , and that was very — very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa’s, they’re still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This time they were in — 1n the 80’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The war did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I said in April 6, 1999 Danish, Bedstefar [Danish]. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Yeah, da — I'll put it sa — put it in Danish again. [</span><span class="sentence" id="98">Speaks Danish here] The Germans have <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then in English he says, poor little <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , she couldn’t do a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She couldn’t do a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he just —he’d been in the German army, you se — oh, I’m sorry, the — the Danish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And of course it was a great history in the 1860’s when Grandpa was in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> growing up, of the first — you know, th-the first war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then of course the World War II is — World War — war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And we — we sensed that, we could see that in — in — in their — in their make-up, what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the connection to your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Oh, I think — I think not too much at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> fell, and then of course <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> moved into — in to the low <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the Ardennes, to the great — the great shock and surprise of the French and British. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And then of course the — the escape of the British at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> to get across, we — that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  So this is a young — as a teenager, you followed in the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">April 6, 1999
ANSWER:  Quite a bit, because in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we would also — not by tha — by this time we’re getting into — into — into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I would have begun <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> — I began <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , 1t would have been in — it had begun in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I begun just that fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> the current affairs magazines, the teachers were visiting about it back and forth, even though the war was still in Europe, of course, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But we were quite aware of it, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Up to that point, did you have any Jewish friends, were there any Jewish families living in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Polish friends as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I was in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> with Marvin Richards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish — and some — and some girls, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So we — we — we had good friends that were, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We were just youngsters, of course, but then on into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we — we had number of Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Council Bluffs</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  And did you read anything in the newspaper about what was happening to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 30’s and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  To my recollection, nothing that I recall, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Although I do recall Dad brought ho — brought hom — brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a story once from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , very facetious, a fun story. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He had some Jewish clients and th — interestingly enough, h — Dad represented one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the other attorney in his o — the other people, and they were April 6, 1999 visiting back and forth, the Jewish gentlemen ga — came quite involved back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad’s client remained, leaned over and says, can you blame Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Can you blame Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But that — that was a kind of a — of a joke sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But there had been word obviously at the time that things were happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as far as anti-Semitic things basically, but no greater awareness at the time, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  And no evidence —
ANSWER:  As far as I would —
QUESTION:  — of anti — and no evidence of anti-Semitism in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  No, I think not. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We had at that time a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> 1s still there, the congregation no long — but the — 1-it was a fairly active <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I don’t ever, ever recall at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any — any suggestion of anti-Semitism at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The wa — ma — dad — Mother and Dad were both very, very liberal in attitude, and very, very tolerant. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Matter of fact we had Jewish neighbors lived right next door to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And there — there was never, to my recollection, any reflection about them as individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Okay, so I assume then as things go on, you’re a student at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you’re following world affairs and then when — what happened when Pearl Harbor occurred? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">April 6, 1999
ANSWER:  We got the word, of course, that Sunday afternoon at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They’re saying, we interrupt this news [indecipherable] and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">A great — a great shocking thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The next morning in the “Des Moines Register” there appeared a — a — the name was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and here was this — this drawing. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a sailor with a knife in his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger, shaking his fist at the departing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Powerful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I remem-mem- member very well, and that’s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in tears, at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And that was now Monday morning at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">At <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Abraham Lincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a — a very fine educator and he ran a tight <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He called the entire school body together, we were in the — the big, large auditortum. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He perceived in his wisdom how he’Il be affecting us, and he had brought — he brought in a large floor model radio which was up on the stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I can see him yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , large but couldn’t take all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President Roosevelt’s war message. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And how interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I thought about it over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Over — over the — the — the stage, on the proscenium of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> , in large gothic April 6, 1999 letters in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">How rather prophetic looking back, huh, at those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That was Monday and then of course during the week, difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a tense week because I remember th-the — the — the [indecipherable] this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as we recall, as the special en — envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of them in the paper, them smiling and very — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then came the word about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But I remember when, during the end of the week as we’re reaching — it would have been in probably December fourth or fifth — third, fourth or fifth, that the word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought — I remember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky — a war with <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> would be terrible, wouldn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then of course, came the events of Sunday and then Monday, of course, war was declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  And so you went on with life as usual at — in — in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed happening, and they already had, to this extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The National Guard had been already brought into federal service by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I thi — I think that our local unit, which was the 168" infantry of the na — 34" division had been mustered in in January the year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we were aware of it because a number of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I April 6, 1999 remember then, it was in the — May of that year, which would have been 1941, before the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in — I was in the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the orchestra, we would play — our — our school march was “The Pilgrim’s Chorus” from Tannhauser. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And — and Mr. Kern liked it, 1t was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Much better than “Pomp and Circumstance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But I remember being th — we were practicing and in came the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster, moved, because here were four, five or six of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students now on active duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So that was — SO We were very much aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And to drop back to your other question, how did it change? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We were much aware, the — the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> paper, “The Echoes” began having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were now in the service, in the military, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">As well, at our <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we had ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band — band people had a military band and the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So there was more emphasis all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I mean that things are going to happen, young people and you’ve got training that’s going on here, it’s going to be helpful to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So the — the high school paper as I said, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where they were training and so forth, so we’re very much aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And, may I add, April 6, 1999 the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities began to be directed. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Junior Red Cross, for example, was having more projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">As — as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So we — were doing, things were happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Did you ever picture yourself in the army when you were young?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Was it a frightening prospect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I—I think at that time there was so much — so much patriotism. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">You know, remember Pearl Harbor and so forth, and of course <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war right away too on this, as you recall — as one recalls. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So, I don’t think — I don’t think wa — it was a fearful project. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Our feeling was everybody’s in it, we will be too, and it’s a part of party responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It’s a gr — a gr — a great sense of patriotism at that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  We were getting closer to graduation obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I think, looking back, the courses that we had, there was a real awareness of maybe boning up on your mathematics and so forth, that kind of thing basically because you might have military. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ROTC units</span> , as I recall having a lot — a lot of training. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">If nothing else, we learned at least close order drill and the manual of arms, if nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And also, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we were getting recruiting requests from the navy, the army and so forth to get signed up to take tests basically, see if you — if you could qualify maybe for some kind of a — of a — of a military education program, which there was a number of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">The navy had them, the army had April 6, 1999 them and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So we took tests now during that year to see 1f you could qualify for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So we were heading 1n that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  And did you qualify for any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Yes, the way it worked, graduated in June of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We’d heard nothing back from the tests at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some of our class, for example had already done — signed up for submarine officer training and so forth, some for the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Drake University</span> in June, just after graduation for about — it was about a month, six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Drake, because it had been Dad’s school, it was a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Des Moines</span> , and Dad’s thought was, get as much education as you can before the military, which was exactly right. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And then, after about six weeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program, ASTRP. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age 18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And then, after finishing one’s first term, and when you reached your 18" birthday or past it, then that term would stop in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you would be s — be — you would become a part of the army itself, be sworn in, have your basic training, then the program would come back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified for, we were — I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Des Moines</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Drake University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Down, I remember going downtown at the direction, and I had all the papers and so forth, I — in — April 6, 1999 went into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And then terminated my work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drake</span> , went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and oh then two or three weeks afterwards reported to then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Crook</span> for induction into the actual — the actual service itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Our group went to <span class="BUILDING">Kansas University</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , Kansas. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And we began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had — we had uniforms, ROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the first term of just basic engineering beginning supposedly, until we’d accomplished our 18" birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Mine was September 29", you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So I finished the first term, and then those of us that had reached age 18 then went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a brief furlough, we reported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dodge</span> in <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , then sworn into the army itself, huh, and then began our real army experience, because after the initial beginning in the army you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing, [indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">basic training camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And that would have been then — that was just about the middle of November of 1943.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  It was cold and damp, I recall that quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But it was something else because now we were in uniform full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We began our actual basic training which at that time was a 17 year — a 17 week course. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">You begin the whole thing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Now, we’d already had, to a degree we’d had some military training at — in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we had some, w-we had — we’d had some at <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> , <span class="BUILDING">KU</span> , at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So we had the basic, we had alr — been through close order drill, we had the manual of arms degree, but then you go through the whole thing and now for the thirst — the first time you’re in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Non-coms were okay, we were learn — our training company was in the <span class="REGION">area</span> called the <span class="REGION">Harmony Church area</span> , which was the training area that we had for the AST people. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We April 6, 1999 were there and week by week the training went on basically, and we got underway in pretty good shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  And then when you completed basic training?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a fairly high fever, but I made it by about four days okay, back in, but because of technicality I had — I was told I would have to go back into an earlier cycle. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Here I was, I’d been with these — most of them my friends from <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> and all fellows I’d known basically now — in basic, literally, for over the last 10 weeks or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And it was very — a really tough growing up process because these are the folks I’d come to know and so forth, that I was taken aback. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But anyway, transferred back into another — another group basically, and we completed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But then, the next thing that happened was this, we were just barely finishing it up, word came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that the AST prog — P program was being eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They needed people carrying guns, not books and the result was that not only the ASP — TP was being washed out, but also a number of Air Force cadets that had only gotten to a certain level, were also into the infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Result was then that we were much — a lot of turmoil what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Mother learned about it, she was terribly upset, she wrote the congressman and so forth, as if anything could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But that’s the way it was April 6, 1999 and so we got packed up, we had finished pretty much of our training and we were then shipped to the 86" Blackhawk division, then training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Livingston</span> , <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So the trip then was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Livingston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There we were met and greeted basically and then — and then began our training with the 86" division.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  And you were trained to do what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We were assigned to A company 342" infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We were a — wh- which 1s — which, as I should add, a rifle company. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">To explain a bit further, in a division, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in April 6, 1999 the form of three regiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We were in 342". </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The Blackhawk had regiments 341", second and third. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And every regiment then would have three battalions. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">A battalion would be composed of a headquarters company of the colonel, lieutenant colonel ba — of the lieutenant colonel basically, of the — of the battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The headquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some other service. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Then, in each — in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle companies and a weapons company. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I — and I give this because it gives a better background for the future I think, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">A rifle company had approximately, in what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by, normally, a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the platoon leader, for each of the four platoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The — the three rifle platoons and the weapons platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And sometimes there would be another — another officer who 1s — be assistant — the assistant company commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">In our company it was Captain Mitchell, and then we had the — th-the — the four lieutenants. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Basically — trying to recall base — the names we had ba — there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant Budman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And those were basically the officers that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men each. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant person. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is April 6, 1999 the three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad — squad leader, who’d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be 12 [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Be two scouts, two patro — two [indecipherable] of two squad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basically and other riflemen down the <span class="DLF">line</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So therefore each — each rifle platoon had those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">In the weapons platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">separate, those — those were the light machine guns, and there were two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars, which is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi — that would be a rifle company. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There was also each ra — in each battalion, a heavy weapons company, which would be the — would be the — the — the water cooled heavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And so that was basically the structure of — of a regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And then we were A company of that, and I was in the first squad, third platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I was a scout, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  And so then you were trained to be a scout and then you continued on to where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Exactly, we finished training, provisional training in February, March. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Picture changed because all of us recognized there were more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Air Force people coming in that had been washed out of — ne — not wa — that’s the wrong te — but they — they’ve been transferred out of the infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So we began getting a lot more April 6, 1999 people in and really the company was pretty much complete, the way it stayed pretty much through, by probably May, June. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">We were then <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp</span> [indecipherable] until — through July, went on maneuvers for the month of August and then the word came down that we were going to be transferred probably out to <span class="REGION">California</span> , the whole division for amphibious training, and that’s what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  And?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  To <span class="REGION">California</span> in September, we had about — been probably a span of two months of amphibious training, which was getting us ready for the south — the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There’s the small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing craft</span> you see in the pictures of basically, you know, like fre — quite a bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So we had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camp</span> , complete amphibious training. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We finished that training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span> by mid-November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  1944, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Waited and then back after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span> , we’ve been in <span class="REGION">southern California</span> , basically in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> , December 17" began the Battle of the Bulge, which changed the picture tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Word came down we were going to probably be going to the <span class="REGION">east coast</span> , going to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The requirement was they needed more troops in Europe because of the impact of the bulge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  You are now 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">April 6, 1999

<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  We were in the <span class="BUILDING">Ford factory</span> , I’m guessing probably about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That’s when we first began to realize we were there because the Germans were our — on the opposite side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Now we — we’re now on the left or th-the — the — the <span class="DLF">west bank</span> , all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Germans on the <span class="REGION">east side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> at that point, very sizeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I’d say the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> was probably maybe a half a mile wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It was wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And we could look over and see there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And we would go up in the — in the — 1n the — in the structure of the <span class="BUILDING">Ford factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It was just as if the workers had walked away, there were big — there were rather big <span class="DLF">assembly lines</span> , there were engines on the <span class="DLF">assembly lines</span> being put together, but they were all gone, but — and walked in, there was a great big [indecipherable] <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , thanks to the second armored division, they’d already bi — somebody painted it up there [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We were there, I’d say, about that length of time, but from time to time we were getting artillery coming in, just nuisance that the Germans had put across. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Our fir — introduction to the 88, which April 6, 1999 was the 88 millimeter ca — a remarkable weapon the Germans had. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">First of all, it was — it was began, it was ta — it was tested in the Spanish Civil War by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was anti-aircraft, could reach way up [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It could also be a Howitzer, which is a — and a flat trajectory. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I remember that’s the first experience, I remember we would — the flat traje — that was really spooky because the Germans would fire in and this sharp crack and that’s the first you knew it’s — it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And it was — it was — it was frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">That was our first [indecipherable] mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  And then, to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We were there for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Then we were told we’re gonna be pulled out and indeed we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We were replaced by the 82" airborne division, now that had had experience already during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And as we — I remember as we were walking out, marching out past the — past the cut — en-entry kiosk they have there, in were coming men of the 824, we were on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I remember walking past, looking up and there was this great big, tall, tall soldier, two big stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was General Gavin — Gavin. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Then we were pulled out into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and dropped, taken back into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> some distance back. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Now there we did see civilians for the first ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We were moved into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we’re moved on April 6, 1999 farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But there was the conversation, what little German I had with — with one of the ladies there, because she — she was very upset, very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">This 1s [indecipherable] this is your war, this is nicht unsere. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">This is not our war, this is zine(ph) war, this 1s your war, she was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But she wa — she was very, very upset about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">We didn’t accept it of course, but that’s the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We were there a limited time only and then we were take — put — back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> again, six by sixes, and this was the long trip we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">This was really, now will take us into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We left that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> o-of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we’d had in our company. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We had some injuries because as the Germans were dropping these shells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th — into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen area</span> and injured, didn’t — not badly, some of the cooks, shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And — an-and you had to watch it because you could sometimes hear the shells coming in and you’d duck. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And that was pretty unnerving for — this was our first [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But then we had learned and got the whole story, it was a — it was a bad situation, unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Somebody, an officer had determined it was necessary to have an reconnaissance patrol across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Why, I’m not sure, but there — maybe to make a record or something, but they saw a set up and A company supplied — I was not in— A company supplied a number of the men, and went off at nighttime, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , rubber April 6, 1999 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Lieutenant Henry, who — fine, he was a good man, of the first platoon, was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">The patrol was probably about — I’m guessing probably, I understand about 15 or 20, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They got across and as reconstructed later they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Tell — the story came back and we were told that they got over to the other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Apparently there was — there had been a lot of firing and there was smoke drifting back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And — and what happened was — was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The two scouts moved out ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They were probably, as we get, maybe 10 or 15 yards ahead of the patrol itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">End of Tape One, Side B April 6, 1999 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">This is tape number two, side A.
ANSWER:  The scouts had gotten out ahead, maybe 10 or 15 yards or so, and as we get the story, the main patrol was behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">The main patrol saw then, two figures coming at them in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">They gave the password. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">The challenged party is supposed to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">The parties did not answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Somebody in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> opened fire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They tried, apparently then, to carry Corny’s body back. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They couldn't get it all the way back and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But that was our first — one of — one of those terrible thi — I mean, you know, the matter of the so-called friendly fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the missile leaves the barrel, it’s no longer friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But it was a bad thing, so we — on that — on that note then, we learned about that basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And then — then after that, the next day or so came our continuing trip on into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">To go and pick that up, we left during the day, six by sixes again, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , parallel down through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> itself and then on south to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And we’re going through April 6, 1999 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> , later of course, the capitol of the west — <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , a ba — interesting old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I remember from Aunt Agnes’ [indecipherable] that was the birthplace of Beethoven, here are these things coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We wound up someth — south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> and then onto a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> then at a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We could see to the south what were called the Drachenfels, that’s part of that — tha — of the other Wagnerian business. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And there were — there were — there were barrage balloons farther south. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We learned later that’s the point where the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> had been captured across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span> , it’s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Then — now by this time we were really now on the east side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and moving deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We crossed several remarkably interesting <span class="DLF">roads</span> , because they were autobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in — and the Germans in the 1930’s as — as big work projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We crossed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So we got the ti — we got the word <span class="DLF">autobahn</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But farther into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we began seeing more signs of combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">There were destroyed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> and [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or so east, a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siegen</span> , s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into what was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days before, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east April 6, 1999 parallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">German Ruhr</span> , which was the great <span class="REGION">industrial area</span> , and 1s, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="626"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duren</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to come together in out at <span class="REGION">area</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paderborn</span> , p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e. They joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Then the plan apparently was that they would — Americans, we would bring in reinforcing divisions along where those two big pincers — p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The divisions would then, on the <span class="REGION">south side</span> turn to the north, on the north side turn to the south and gradually converge to come together to eliminate the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We were one of those divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Other divisions were the 78", the men of the eighth division, I’Il come back that, that we had re-reinforced — replaced, they come into the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The 97" division was there, on the <span class="REGION">south side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We were taken to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zimmersbach(ph</span> ) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h — z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h. Small, tiny, tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We were billeted in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a great, huge manure pile out in front, typically of — of a — of a— of a <span class="REGION">German peasant area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">A comfortable <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we — we — it was good because we — the guys could find eggs and we fried eggs and so we were there a matter of two or three days getting final togetherness and getting things ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we attended <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and one of the medics we had was a — a very accomplished April 6, 1999 organist who played the German organ there. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I remember seeing in the <span class="DLF">front cemetery</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there was some — some — some <span class="DLF">graves</span> which had been obviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they were buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Then — then we left that <span class="REGION">area</span> , April eighth of 1945, we were taken by our six by sixes 1n the final — the final stretch — or we’re — we’re hiking, we’re — we are on foot, into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> , because we’re getting ready to take off, as we say, if we jump off in the attack the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So we’re rowt — right up — right practically at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And spent the night there in <span class="BUILDING">bivouac</span> , not <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , we just s- slept <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And then early the next morning we — we jumped off in the attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">That would have been April ninth now, of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">To the north — nor- northwest actually, into the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Then, next several days, our first major incursion into the <span class="REGION">area</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sauerland</span> , s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d. Sauerland, one word, I-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was — was — of all strange things to know — but it was very rugged <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , wooded. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I-I-In the infantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We moved through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Not much was happening, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The Germans were pulling back, there was some occasional firefights there, not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I remember several times there, we — we did experience German mortars coming in as they were defending, but not — not a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">It was a fast push, because we would be on April 6, 1999 the way most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We — at nighttime we’d grab a few hours sleep if we could, maybe in a — 1n a—1n a—I remember sleeping one night on the — on the — on the — on the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Another night we were — and that was lucky, we were in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and they had some straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But pretty much we were pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And that would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And then it was on Wednesday, which was April 11 when we began — I si— remember seeing a sign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And that was when we began really approaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Attendorn</span> and that’s — that was our first major combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  And you —
ANSWER:  We were on the reverse, or south side of a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , in strength, meaning we were — we were — we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">We — A company at that time was the — was in the lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">To explain, I am the lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Normally in a battalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side by side, the third in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And the same with two bi — there might be two ba — battalions there, and the third in reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">At that time A company then, we — we were leading in the attack into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Attendorn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And the result was, up the <span class="DLF">hillside</span> , I remember then around the c — as we made the curve on a <span class="DLF">roadway</span> and began working through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , we looked across and there was a treeburst April 6, 1999 on the distant <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Let me explain treeburst. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Artillery shells are so constructed, either number one, they’re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Explosive shells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the minute that even touches any object, even a twig, it would explode. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Very sen — and in a fa — in an artillery barrage, if the barrage is going into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> , as it would hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , it’d break and that’s called a treeburst. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Very, very dangerous because of the — the shell — shrapnel just spins right down. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">That was at a distance though, but — I’m speaking to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Then we came around the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and then ahead of us, red tile roof and so on, was this very sizable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was Attendorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We came up through — I si — the company, I mean basically, I remember we’re coming past some of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and — the cannon company is a large, self propelled, it’s a one-oh-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) of our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but he also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons platoon, he was helping on that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Weapons platoon then began setting up machine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our platoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep <span class="DLF">hill</span> on the run, on the double, rifles up well, ther-there ha — we call porter, to attack the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And then we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">We learned afterwards that April 6, 1999 the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruhr</span> was so much attacked by allied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that they had a tremendous amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">88s and 20-20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">When there were no longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level those and use against the aca — ca— oncoming Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So we had a lot of — a lot of 88s coming in, artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , 3" platoon began taking casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We had a sergeant who was killed, our lieutenant was injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Several others were injured down the late — way, too, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And it’s a strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You’re there, it’s happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of the discipline you’ve had, you — you’re scared, right down in the pit of your stomach, but — but y-y-you do it, you go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Then into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right nearby — I sa —I say, then, a number of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And then Dave Sargent(ph) — Sergeant Dave, a sergeant, I remember, was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , he said okay, because then the next thing we had to do out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , Dave directed us down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , we went on down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> , waist high. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Cold, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Up the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> basically and I— I—I’d had — I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete, you’re the first one across. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So I crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , up onto the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , cold, rifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Then across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , we got across okay, but you get — for the first April 6, 1999 time you’re getting some vicious snapping — you know, th-the — or sniping, around. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We learned however, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in with a white flag and their at — their — see if they surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The company man who thought they might. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The name was Bob Oelke, o-e-I-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, tossed him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">With presence of mind he went into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">But that we learned later. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then we began moving through. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We, meaning the third platoon, we were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Now, at that time, as we moved along, by this time it’s probably three, four in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Cobblestone <span class="DLF">streets</span> , rifles on the ready, covering each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">This is called a mopping up operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But the Germans seemed to have pulled out — I mean, I don’t remember anything more at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone <span class="DLF">street</span> [indecipherable] that we approached a <span class="REGION">factory area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Obviously there was some — and then behind this <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> were these people, unkempt, dirty, emaciated and Mac — I’m sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him, went up and opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Now, at this point I must explain that for some reason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , but I April 6, 1999 have talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He — he had detail — details I'd forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Strange about memory, some things you — but Mac is very explicit that he’d opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">The people were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They realized apparently we’re Americans, uniforms ra — they began crowding out and — and — and — and — and trying to embrace us, and — and — and kiss us apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I don’t recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by — by sar — Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant — then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy stench and odor. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Again, I — this I didn’t recall and I’m surprised because I’m normally pretty aware of olfactory things. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But 1t was there, amb — obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">What I do recall though now, very clearly, myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We had gone into a nearby <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , because Mac’s determination was we gotta — gotta watch out for whate — there might be krauts around. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Kraut being the derogative name for German. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">There might be krauts here, they gotta check it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I remember stepping into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> now, and I think it — it was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , maybe 50 by 50 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I do remember there were — there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac started to walk over across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Now, 1n his detail, Sergeant MacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it — he — he’s from <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">It was horse’s skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And walked over. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">This I remember too, beca April 6, 1999 — he walked over and there was an old — to me appeared to be an old woman, crouched down, holding something. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And — and Mac was over there, paused for a moment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I’m being explicit. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Those goddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">The lady is scraping out that horse’s skull for food and eating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Gee, well. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">He also said, forget about the goddamn horse, they’ve scraped all the meat off that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">There was a heavy — I remember it now, this at — there was a heavy odor and — and we walked past and — and there was a body. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I’m not sure dead or alive, but — but — but Mac pointed out the face and he — he — look at that poor son of a bitch’s legs, they were — they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been putrid-putri-putrefaction, I’m guessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Back out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> , fresh air thank God, because all the other — and on back out and I remember we got back out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing up, one of our guys be — just — just the impact of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And Mac said, and I did remember this, that a lot of — they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know [indecipherable] people were out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they just kind of wandered out, the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">A — an officer came along and advised that we had to get them back <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because they needed attention, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And they could not be wandering the <span class="DLF">street</span> by themselves, so somehow, and I don’t recall, they must April 6, 1999 have been herded back in, because after that then we — we moved ahead and we were on our way after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit more about that experience before we move ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  Did you try to talk to any of these prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  Not — not that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Now, in my — in — in my notes — and I mention notes because — I-I must go ahead, I’ll fast — fast forward a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">When we had gotten back from Europe, we had a 30 day — a 30 day furlough. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We were the first division back from Europe, big welcome, but we have 30 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And during that time I sat down and typed out my — a log. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Now in — in that log that I have — I-I got it — well, of course, it was so fresh then. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I c — I could do it day by day and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the names of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and guys names. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I showed basically in that — and if I may refer for a moment to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">This — this isn’t my original log. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And turning now on it to April 11", and here we are at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Attendorn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I am showing here things that I’ve touched upon quite a bit before, some other details that don’t relate to this, but as to this particular matter, through the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , as we’re going up the <span class="DLF">street</span> , into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752"><span class="BUILDING">Pillbox warehouses</span> , first platoon to our right flank, went through <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , capture of a German ak-ak crew in the <span class="BUILDING">photo shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">West and south along the [indecipherable] past the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to the left, with an 88 covering, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Through April 6, 1999 the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> into — I [indecipherable] a <span class="DLF">Russian prisoner enclosure</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Now, whether we were told they were Russians, I have no recollection o-of the — I wouldn’t know Russian probably, well if I— you know, I could guess, but — when I’d heard it basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And I don’t recall any conversation with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  Did any of them try to touch you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  I don’t —I don’t recall that, but Mac in his recitation says that they were trying to grab us and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We probably pushed them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Again, this heavy, terrible odor, and — and — and Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) who was there at the time, and I hadn’t realized this, he said it was caused probably, mostly from lot of — the latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">The latrines were only ditches dug there, said captain, about 30 - 40 feet long, full of excrement and — an-and — and other elimination that caused this terribly heavy odor that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">But as far as — I don’t recall the touching, but Mac says that they were trying to grab us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Were they wearing civilian clothes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Th-These were not — these were not prison type uniforms at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They just seemed to be, as I remember, just civilian clothes, but rags — ragged, torn and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  These were men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Were there any young people, or mostly —
ANSWER:  I do not recall — April 6, 1999
QUESTION:  — age-wise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  — seeing any young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Now Mac mentions that there was an episode, a part of that we left there, said he that there was a woman who apparently it was a — had been a prisoner, who — who apparently was — was getting at and be-beating up a German woman who may have been a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Now, as near as — apparently there were both men and women there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Whether they were housed together, I-I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">ANSWER:  Not long. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">My own recollection was that — that our — our going into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the — the horse’s skeleton was, probably three, maybe five minutes at the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , because it was, as I said, Mac got right over, saw what it was, and we just left pretty quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">There were no German soldiers at all to run — there — there — there — the Germans had pulled out apparently — apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So we were out of there within oh, I’d say probably five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">A little longer, then probably get out of the compound, back out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Did you try to feed any of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Give them any food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  Not too my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Not to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">The situation has been really defined by Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph) quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">When, as we look at it in the context of that whole day, we had had a drastic experience coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I April 6, 1999 mean, the — we — th-the fighting and so forth, and the weaponry. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And — and — and this was just one other part of it, and — and it did not really assume any great importance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was happening elsewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the scenes we’ve seen of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Now, there were — I’m told — historians — a good friend who’s an historian says that there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slave labor camps</span> only, which — which apparently the Germans had established the industry to set little satellite areas where prisoners would be required that th — th-the labors to build parts or something of that type, which would then be taken in and used by the German industry in the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diisseldorf</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But that was a part of — of the whole program. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But, backing into their appearance, there was emaciation basically and — and — and — and — but the — but the — that the clothes, they were wearing rags, tags, but they were not uniforms, as I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Just not uniform types.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Was it a frightening experience for you to see people in this kind of condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Different. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I don’t know that it was any more frightening than what we’d already had, I mean in the combat side of it, you know, from the firing and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I-I think — I think it was just, we accepted it, but without really paying a great deal of attention to it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I mean, it was there, we saw, it was there basically it was bad, it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">April 6, 1999
QUESTION:  Did it make a difference to you that these were civilians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  It was different in the sense that the — the — these were not combatants, not combatants, and how they could be used that way, later on upon reflection, you realize, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">At the time, that’s the way it was, but then you begin to think about it afterwards and yeah, there’s a part of the — the incongruity of it, I mean, the fact that they were simply civilians, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  You said when you walked out, one of your fellow soldiers got nauseous. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Did you all talk about what you had just seen? </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Did anybody say anything to the other person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">ANSWER:  Oh, the usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The usual oaths and so forth and expressions of you know, to put it bluntly, Jesus Christ, what the hell are we seeing, what was — well, all — all — all — all — without going — becoming too explicit, but you get the idea, I mean, gee, I mean, my God, it — 1t was — it was an incredible thing, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I suppose the — the passage of years puts a — puts a different complexion on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I know that — that as far as other parts of combat, guys were killed, we recognized it, accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I realized, it wasn’t until maybe after getting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the 30 day span of time, it really began to come back of what we had been through and seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I wonder if probably in that situation you — you — you develop a sort of an inurement to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I-I know that was our discipline, held us together despite the fear, the terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And — and — April 6, 1999 and — and — and to be, for example in a — 1n a -- an artillery barrage is a — 1s — 1s — is — 1s a gut grinding — you know, experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">But we were there, and — and — and it was a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Some guys — we had a few that — that chickened out, that couldn't handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">My sergeant — not — not — well, not — not Mac, he was fine, but my own squad sergeant, we got through Attendorn, if this is a part of what you want, we were talking about, we got through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Attendorn</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , came back on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> again, dropped down to take a few minutes break basically, and then Sergeant Markson(ph) from <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , good chap, and my own sergeant, George Evans just flopped down. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">George was ashen. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He said, I can’t take this shit, he says, I— I can’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Bud came down pretty — he said, George, God damnit, you got the stripes, this is our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And maybe that did it, but — but — but — but he — geor — he was out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Now, I think he got put back together himself a lit — later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">But — but at the time, he couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It happened, and you couldn’t — from unexpected persons, it ha-happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">You would have expected some others, who you think might be washouts, did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">It — it — 1t — th-there’s no rule of thumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But that was a particular experience at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You speak about the matter of what we had seen and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I-I don’t know, there wasn’t a lot of discussion afterwards, we went through it, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Other things were taking April 6, 1999 priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I mean, you know, your own safety and your own welfare and what was going to happen next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  And then what did happen next? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">You left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Attendorn</span> and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  We stayed there that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">We finished through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> probably by six, seven o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We were assigned there and the next thing that they — that the — Captain Mitchell did was to establish a <span class="DLF">guard perimeter</span> around the <span class="DLF">hills</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So the nor — the <span class="DLF">north hilltop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And Sergeant Evans and myself and Frank Horn went up to one <span class="DLF">hilltop</span> and were there that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And that-that was the night later on that we got machine gun fire in the black of the night and — and in the topography of it, on the <span class="DLF">hilltop</span> , George above me and to the north, Frank Horn above me a bit and to the south, and I was down. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Machine gun fire, George was — was killed almost immediately and Frank so badly shot up in the back, he — tha-that — that — back to battalion aid and died several days later, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">All I got, a — incredibly fortunate, just a flesh wound in my — in the — my — in my left leg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  You are 19 years old, how did you feel — how old did you feel after that day and that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  I didn’t realize what had happened about getting a — th-th-the [indecipherable] my leg, until the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We came off the <span class="DLF">hilltop</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Our — our — our April 6, 1999 medic Hank Billskey(ph) was right there, I see him now, he was right there, amazing, after this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">My captain, Captain Greenburg(ph), who is here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with me, we’ve had [indecipherable] we talked about that this morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">He was describing some of the things that happened to him, so — these close calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Friend he had been in OCS with was killed with a treeburst about three or four feet away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And as I told him, I said, Captain, I can — I can sit here and right now, I ca — I can hear — I can hear George gurgling as he was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I can hear — I can hear Frank — when Billskey(ph) got there he said, I need a sa—I need a syrette. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">That — that was a morphine syrette. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">An-And Hank says my God, he said, good for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">In — in it — he — he co — he could name it [indecipherable] right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So, it could come right back, I don’t know that there was any particular sign of aging at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I-It doesn’t — it doesn’t come that peremptorily. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">You realize after you’ve gone all through these things that — that — you know, you had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Bur as far as an immediate recognition, it’s just a part of the whole damn thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B April 6, 1999
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">This is tape number two, side B. And you were talking about your reaction to the — that day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  A-As commented, I think — I think that at the time there is a — there — there 1s an insulation, I suppose, that is given you by your — your discipline that you have, to a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Other things become so drastic that you — something I suppose, maybe mentally helps block them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">To get through them you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Maybe, as I suggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the — our har — our months furlough. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And I remember it happened when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , after we’d gotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we went back several times, I ca — I kind of — and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">George, Frank’s did, some others we had then too, the — just the — the — the — the immensity of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">After those experiences, you’re do — you do have dreams and nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I had — it’s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out of the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had that then. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Then we also had some more drastic experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">We were the second company, the second American company in the whole army to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> farther south. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">A company from the 103" division to the southwest, crossed in the morning of the 26", and we crossed the night of the 26", so by — by an English April 6, 1999 [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of — quite a few wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Some wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But it’s after then as I discovered, getting back over there, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I’d wake. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">They’ve diminished. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that — either — I’m either going to be going into the army again, or I’m in the army again. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And terribly glad to wake up to realize that it is not happening again. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">That 1 — that has come sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie “Saving Private Ryan.” </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Now, I’ve talked to my company — Captain Greenburg(ph), he’s seen it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Every — every combat veteran I’ve talked to has had a similar experience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five minutes is in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , but then — then you begin — then one begins seeing the beginning of D-Day with the small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">craft</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing craft</span> coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Now, we were not D-Day of course, but we did have the training in amphibious. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And it was a remarkable thing because as I watched that in the darkened <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> — my sa — Pat wa — wife Pat did not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">As I watched that and — and — and — and the camera, for those who will see it recall that you saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> from the side and then that moved over and panned right into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> itself, and you’re looking at the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Hanks, the captain and the ca — played the part of the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I was there again. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">It April 6, 1999 was like it was our platoon going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The — the roar of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motors</span> , the spray of the spray coming over the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Guys being — throwing up around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">The gear all just the same, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the picture, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">craft</span> hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> went down, typical training, and then the German artillery, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mortars</span> opened up, machine gunning the whole — I found myself audibly crying, I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I— ve —I—I-—I have a free sample, Captain Greenburg(ph) who you

ANSWER:  We have spoken about my friend Jim McRandall’s(ph) analogy of the — of — of — of the broken mirror and the shards of memory, and — and says Jim, just as you cannot effectively reconstruct that mirror with the broken shards, some pieces are missing, some pieces are quite sharp, to carry on the — the — the metaphor of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">But to all of us, to all of us, we can go back, and in our experience, in this — in the world in which we live, the — the — 1-in my terms, the crucible of contra — of combat, you can see and remember the expression a certain fellow had, one of your — one of your G.I. buddies on the <span class="DLF">street corner</span> at a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">You can — you can see or visualize a <span class="DLF">hillside</span> , or a certain <span class="NPIP">setting</span> where you were and what was happening at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">You can still recall the thunk of a mortar in the distance or the rattle of machine gun fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And they bring back — they — they can bring back these things, 1n some bizarre, strange way, but can never be fully — never fully reconstructed, just as — as a broken mirror can not be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And what you’re seeing in the broken mirror also many times is — and results of being distorted in some ways, you know, th-th-the — the different angles you’re seeing of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And — and — and that’s why you get with different veterans different views of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">The April 6, 1999 — the famous story of — of the — of the four blind men blindfolded with the elephant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">One, the one leg and the trunk and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And you — then that’s very much the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And — and in — in a combat situation, the first thing you realize is there’s begin — it-it’s confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I have here our division history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And as I read it through there are many <span class="REGION">areas</span> — history is hard — is hard to recover accurately and I find many things that I — I ca — I describe as being garbled in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">It depends who one talks to, it depends how it’s reconstructed, and it — wh-while there’s a lot of good work, at the same time there are things that do come off wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">But so be it, I mean, tha-that’s a part of the problem of reconstructing history.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">ANSWER:  I think — I think better to be young because we were young, impressionable, but we learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">We did not have intense, deep preconceptions of things and we would accept discipline better as younger people, I think, basically and could be trained better, seems to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And — and — and — and war is not a thing for anybody, but less I think older persons than younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I think you maybe adjusted better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">There was so many descriptions of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">One of the best, of course, is course the old original, the wa — the time honored one of — of Sherman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Another one too that — that to — to be April 6, 1999 in combat is looking like — you are looking like in a <span class="DLF">window</span> into <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">A variety of things, the base — I think maybe as young people we can hopefully, maybe accept them more easily than we can a-as older — I’m not — I’ve not followed that too, too much, but certainly it — it — 1t’s for young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">If — if — if you have to be there, a younger person.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">QUESTION:  The Danish experience, as opposed to the German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">ANSWER:  Well, it’s quite inters — it’s quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Number one, there had been a great — a great tradition, history of tolerance in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> [indecipherable] also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">But early enlightenment, which began in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in the 1820’s - 30’s, they had — they had left the monarchy, I mean the — the actual absolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">A smaller <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I’m not sure, except that there was — it was indeed a safe haven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Now, as to how the wonderful escape took place in October, several things I — I read — as we read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Number one, there had been the great feeling of the Danish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">The-The-These are not Danish Jews, April 6, 1999 it’s Jewish Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">A subtle distinction, but it’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Secondly the war situation was turning against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Allies were in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> had been completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">The general feeling was — was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The proximity — the proximity of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> now, made it possible, which might, in a landlocked <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> not have happened, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And the willingness of the Swedes to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">There’s a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to take the Danish Jews, time was short. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">It was a matter of days, but they had to somehow — they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the resistance get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">But they had to have the agreement of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">They could not deal with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and say — because that would tip it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">So what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish leadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">The arrangement was made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that — a leader of the Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">It was arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">The story goes on to say that in — 1n Bohr’s words he said — he said, I’m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why — well, they said you have th- the standing, the name, the King will — all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">It was arranged remarkably April 6, 1999 [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently then, either — either by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> — they’re not — they’re — they’re — they’re still — they’re c-careful, or possibly by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British aircraft</span> , the Mosquito coming, take him over, Bohr was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , to probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drottningholm</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> , the story is told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">He said, in I went, to this massive <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Re-Realized what was on my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I was shown into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and th-th-th-the king’s attendant was there, basically very fine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Then he said the moment came, he said [indecipherable] here — here — here I am just becoming more tense by the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">The <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">He said, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the king, King Gustav. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And he said, I-I have some Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of our people, what was going to happen and — and that we desperately pled for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">He said, the king, very courteous, stood up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">He said, of course I stood up too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">The king walked to the <span class="DLF">window</span> , looked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">He said that — I can [indecipherable] it was probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your people will be welcome in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And that was it, laid the foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">So, a combination of things put together, you see, and of course the — it was not all — I April 6, 1999 mean there were — there were some problems to getting them — getting the Danes across or getting the — the — the Jews across, the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Some — some boat people did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, remarkable thing, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">Incredible.</span></p>
