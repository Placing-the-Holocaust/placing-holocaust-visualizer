<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on May 13, 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about the generations of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">How far back does your family go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Not very far at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My sister, my older sister was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and my parents lived and grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , what was then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Now I don’t know how you pronounce it, Bratslav, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So that’s where both their families came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Tell me your parents names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  My father was Ernst Friedenthal. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my mother was originally Margarita Goldschmidt. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And was always called Marga so we knew her . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I mean we knew her as Marga.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Do you know what years they were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Ido. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I don’t know whether I can remember it right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Yeah, my mother was born in 1900, September 30". </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And my father was born in 1987, November seventh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Not 1987. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">1887. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Exactly, thank you .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  And what kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  He had a law degree and he was a bank director and on the board of a number of <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And one of the interesting aspects that I will talk more about later is that when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the circumstances were very bad financially as far as my parents were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And he, in 1948, went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he wanted to help build up the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And so he went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> asked him to come back and he worked there until he retired and was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother was not as happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So and that’s a very unusual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My sister and I swore we would never go back there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  We can talk about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And tell me about your other siblings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  I, my older sister, Renata, Julia Renata Friedenthal was, is four years older than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So was born in 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I had another sister called Ruth who was two years younger than my older sister and two years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">She died at a very young age when she was four in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Of I think septicemia which there was no drugs for that or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So I never, I don’t remember her very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Really what I know about her is more from what my sister has told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And my sister lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> and has children and grandchildren there so she comes and visits me occasionally and I go and visit her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Did you live right in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No, we lived, well we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schmangendorf</span> [ph] which is I think, it’s not east, but it’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But one of the things I want to do is go and visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My husband never wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I haven’t been back since and for a long time I didn’t particularly want to go either. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But now I feel that it’s time to just go back and check out where I was born and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">https://collections.ushmm.org It was let’s see, I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> being that we would go there on a Sunday afternoon or something to walk in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So that’s the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> it was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I really don’t know anything more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about the religious life of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">How would you explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well this is very strange because both my families, both my parents’ families were Jewish and in both cases they knew each other for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was quite a sizeable Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> when they were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they were quite close to their cousins and so they’re not related directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But their parents who were both lawyers, their fathers who were both lawyers, decided that they, they themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">No, that’s wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">That they would bring up their children as Christians, because they wanted them to have the opportunities that everybody else had. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And they themselves had, they felt really suffered because they were very bright smart people. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They could never rise in the legal profession beyond a certain level. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They could never be judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And they felt that that really hampered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, so both my parents grew up as Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And in both cases no cousins did but they did and in fact —
QUESTION:  When you say no cousins, what do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well none of the other related families that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> became Christian, that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And so we were raised as Christians also. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I had one aunt who became very attached to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and in fact was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and worked with Niemdller and did some wonderful things in getting people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She herself didn’t get out til I think it was 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  This is Pastor Niemoller.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yes, Pastor Niemoller. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And my father I think more than my mother also became really quite an active Protestant, Lutheran when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I’m not sure that they went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that very much at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But they did you know they brought us up that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They heard our prayers and then when we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Or my mother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Were you christened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was christened. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were all christened. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I think I have the paper that says that I was christened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And both my sister and I continued actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I mean she first, she became very active in the student Christian movement when she was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I did also when I was at <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And you know we felt because we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then and it was not a big deal because it was the <span class="BUILDING">state church</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Church of England</span> and a lot of things went along with that —
QUESTION:  Let’s go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We haven’t spent much time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  You were born in 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So what are your first memories of that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I think my earliest memories are of playing in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and of a nanny we had who looked after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We didn’t see a lot of our parents actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Mother, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They were both were from well to do families basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My father made enough money that she didn’t have to work and she you know she ran the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and we had a nanny and I think we had a cook and a maid also. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Was it a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , Christians and Jews or was it mostly Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  You know I can’t tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I’m assuming it was a mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My parents used to have parties, give parties and were careful to mix Christian and Jews together. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And you know we sort of peaked at what was going on at the parties sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had some close relatives who played a large part in the future of our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The name was Pariser, P-A-R-I-S-E-R. My cousin and Hannah Pariser were, sorry, my father and Hannah Pariser were first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They https://collections.ushmm.org were from the Milsch family, M-I-L-S-C-H. Sort of funny that I married Milkman. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And so they kept in touch with them a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They lived in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And Franz Pariser was a, I think he was the president of the textile organization, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they had a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So Ill talk about him later also. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Other things that I remember, I remember we had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I remember that I was very active, much more so than my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And liked to do gymnastics and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And there was a swing you know in a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , hung 1n a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> which I used a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And at one point I do remember this. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I fell off it and split open my chin. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I still have the scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">After all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But sort of one of the memories that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And then my memory of you know my first day at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When I was six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well you know big excitement is that when on your first day at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you get this great big it’s sort of a cornucopia of candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You probably know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so that’s the most exciting thing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Public school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Boys and girls? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Both religions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">You have to realize that I didn’t know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Nor did my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But you were Lutheran.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  So I just thought I was like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You know I had friends and made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I remember going roller skating on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">With them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  So those are really among your earliest memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yeah right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Hitler came into power in 33. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">When were you first aware of him or had heard of him or —
ANSWER:  Well I think I heard his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I heard talk about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You know in retrospect, there were you know discussions that went on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with other people that we weren’t supposed to hear anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I didn’t really know what they meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I think my sister knew much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Realized much more but she did not know that she was a Jew either. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And it wasn’t until and I’m not sure the exact time but it must have been early 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">When the, there was an edict that Jewish children could no longer go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and we had to go to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Just for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And that was the point at which our parents told us that we were -- no they didn’t even tell us we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">That came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">No they just told us we had to move <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  But how did the authorities know. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I just know if you ever asked your parents later why they then considered you Jewish in the sense that they didn’t bring you up that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You were christened. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Why did they follow that edict if you were Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  They had no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Do you know how they, I know this is they’re telling you the story but how did they say that they knew that they didn’t have a choice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well I think you know my father in his job was well known as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">With a name like Friedenthal you couldn’t be anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And so no I mean it was known that they were Jewish by many people and — https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Openly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yeah, I don’t think it was talked about but and my father had this, this view which I only learned only later but because he was, he had fought in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He had gotten the what, Iron Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And he had a high position in a well-known <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that nothing would happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And of course initially nothing did. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And that was probably because I don’t know who the Interior Minister was at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But my, again this is something I had learned later was that, that he told Hitler that if he rounded up all the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at once, the economy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And so he’d better do it slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I think that gave my father a false sense of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Before we get to when you had to leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you have a lot of religious training up to that time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Do you remember having Jewish friends and not knowing that you were Jewish, or —
ANSWER:  No, I had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  If your friends were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Right and my sister tells, just told me a story that when she was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that, that one day it must have been shortly before we switched <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">One day one of the girls in her class said to her, your father is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And she said no, he’s a banker. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She had no idea what, I mean that shows you, you know how totally isolated we were from that whole idea and then I guess the other thing came when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in January 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And my mother showed us, you know we didn’t have passports or anything, we just had I forget what it was called.</span></p>

QUESTION:  How aware were you of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Oh very aware because one of the things that you know every evening at 6:00 everybody would gather around the radio and then just the way it’s shown often in movies and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And we were told not to interrupt or anything cause everybody wanted to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And you know we heard Churchill’s speeches and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And the news wasn’t very good obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  Did they broadcast Hitler’s speeches at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  Not that I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">No and I don’t know whether, I’m sure they did somewhere, but we didn’t get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And I mean it was very, we were lucky to have a decent radio, ability to at least hear what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And I think the thing was with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that it was full of other kids who were not anywhere near their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or their origins.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Not much, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I have a feeling that they were told not to question me. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Again, in retrospect because that was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But anyhow, then in and again I’m having trouble with the exact dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But I think in the late 1940s when <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was very scared about invasion, in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Yeah, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Late 1940.</span></p>

And the question then was, where do we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And my sister at that point was going to be sponsored by somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , by the Jewish something. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Group. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So that’s where she was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">My mother felt that she wanted to be somewhere where when my father was released he could come to and there would be maybe some opportunities there for working or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And so this, the Pariser family who had by that time moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Albans</span> which was a small, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">market town</span> but a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a very old third century <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And which the Romans occupied at one point and there were <span class="INT_SPACE">Roman baths</span> still and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So it was a nice small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And the Pariser family said you know that we could have the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So that was what my mother and father decided we should do and my father was still in there for at least another six months before he got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And so that was a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go but, but it, I found it a lot better because I went to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That was also interesting because it was, I mean I was still only eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But, but the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> no, I must be older, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">But you know it was one that was -- you had school uniforms, blazers, hats and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And of course this was all an issue because we didn’t have any money to buy these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So I got stuff second hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">They arranged that. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I liked the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> overall and I made friends there. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And learned to play netball, to play basketball, only somewhat different. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> even though it was an old sit up and beg <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I could go bicycle riding with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I did well in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They thought I didn’t know the language probably so they put me in a lower class initially but then I got moved up to where I should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I had a good friend who lived just up the <span class="DLF">road</span> and whose mother was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And sort of would find things that she said her daughter wasn’t going to use any more and so on and give them to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So that was actually a, overall a quite pleasant time. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Though of course the war was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And — https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Again, how aware were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  Oh then I was very aware because first of all the cousins there, they were second cousins actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The Parisers. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and so they would come back on weekends but you know they were there during the Blitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And we were, I mean we would hear things go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We were maybe twenty miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And then later the V-1’s and V-2’s, yeah rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And you know the V-2’s if you didn’t hear them anymore, you knew they were dropping. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">But that was, and after my, when my father was released his cousin, this textile guy was starting just a small business where he used I don’t know what they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">A <span class="INT_SPACE">cutting floor</span> remnants and I don’t know whether he or somebody else, they designed slippers and tam-o-shanters and gloves and all kinds of things to be made from these wool remnants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  The waste
ANSWER:  Yeah the waste, yeah right exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And so he kind of partly employed my father to do the, you know keep the books somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And help out, but my father was very, very depressed at that time because he realized what a terrible mistake he had made. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He clearly that wasn’t really anything he was qualified to do in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Because he knew German law, not British law. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And so he had a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And my mother for the first time in her life had to cook and she enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">She learned to cook from the cousin, who was a good cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And then also she learned to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">We used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> on Saturdays and there was usually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there, a flat, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which had on it old things and that’s where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> came from for very little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And one day we saw it and there was an ancient <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Singer sewing machine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">You know the kind, the treadle kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And so she said, hey that’s what I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And so somehow or other, she arranged to get them to deliver it. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And she taught herself to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Again Hannah Pariser helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">She knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And from then on she sewed all my clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">She sewed my, when she could, my uniforms for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And I did very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">The friend up the <span class="DLF">road</span> and I we sort of competed, not very hard but as to who would be first in the class and who would be second. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And she was smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And https://collections.ushmm.org we really didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">But and the one thing there though that made me very unhappy was that most of the you know you were always, I was always a hanger on to a group that I really wanted to be a part of. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And they would tolerate me but I wasn’t part of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And they were all Girl Guides, Girl Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And that’s what I wanted to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You know I wanted to be a Girl Guide too. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And then maybe I could become really part of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">But that was one thing my parents said absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">You are not going to be in any outfit with uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">We’ve seen enough of what goes on with those. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And of course they didn’t know anything about the Girl Guide movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I got a Girl Guide book and showed it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And said you know it’s all right and these are all good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">They said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">You can’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So that was very hard I found not to be able to, of course they’d go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  Yeah they spoke English but with an accent and so you know you’re always embarrassed about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And well, as everybody says, you can never really belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And that was true throughout my, the whole stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I have to say that I got a wonderful education in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And all of it essentially free, because after, well there was a, you’|l be interested to hear this. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">They had a Christmas pageant at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And because I could play the recorder they, I became annually the shepherd that led everybody else and I played “Silent Night” at the appropriate times. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And I liked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">But again not what you would expect a Jewish refugee to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I did have one bad experience with that whole thing because we would be given, well our costume as a shepherd, you dyed something in tea leaves and you know sewed it together and wore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But I think a friend of mine was a bishop, somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And she had a miter that she was taking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don’t know why she was taking it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And so she had it and she said do you want to wear this and I said sure you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">So I put it on and was walking down past the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we were heading <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And one of the teachers saw me with it on and so she pulled me in, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and she said how dare you do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">It’s sacrilege and you don’t’ know any better and no you probably don’t and she was so awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And here we are letting you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for free you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">We’re giving you this and that and oh it was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And I never told my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But that among other things made me decide that I didn’t https://collections.ushmm.org want to finish my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And they decided that too for other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Because there wasn’t enough advanced stuff being taught.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">QUESTION:  How did they know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  Well you know there was still communication between, well early on you know my two aunts were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and you could still get letters, cards through and I think everybody developed some, a code which made it clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And later on, yeah my mother’s brother and his family went to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and they got news there quite often and would pass it on to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">So that was good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">QUESTION:  But you said that they did lose some relatives?</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you graduated in 46 you say or got your certificate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  I got my school certificate but then I went on to, at that point you can specialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">You can decide what <span class="REGION">area</span> you want to do in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and my sister had specialized in romance languages and I was good at those too but I decided that I didn’t want to do the same thing she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And I had gotten, I enjoyed being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looking at the flowers and insects and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So I decided I’d go into the sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And so that was 45, 46. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">46. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I switched <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , my sister had been in the <span class="BUILDING">Per school</span> which was a very good <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I spent you could spend two years or three years there but I was very young so I actually spent three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">But also so that I hoped I would be able to get a state scholarship which would pay for everything when I went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">If I stayed the extra year and got a distinction in the area that I wanted to go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And that worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And I didn’t apply, I applied to the two <span class="BUILDING">women’s colleges</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Cambridge university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And then I applied to <span class="BUILDING">Bedford College</span> in <span

id="1112">And I got on the waiting list for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and I mean fairly quickly got told that I had gotten in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">Cambridge University</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">Girton College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">That was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And particularly because virtually everything was paid for by the state and got a state scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Oh yes, but the problem then came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">In 1940, let’s see where are we. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">In 1948 my father went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">My mother stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Albans</span> cause she had gotten herself a job in working on interchange with <span

class="sentence" id="1133">And but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And so I needed my board and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , tuition and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And I got a state scholarship which actually paid for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And I got a letter from the <span class="REGION">Cambridge
