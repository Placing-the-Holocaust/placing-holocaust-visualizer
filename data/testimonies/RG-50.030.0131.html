<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, we...you see <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided...half <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and half <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were... mean half <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , half <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We...[ was born on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> ; but we wound up on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And we had it very bad, because we were a big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We had no food, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So we tried to get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which what belonged to the <span class="REGION">German side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">At that time, the Russians took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There was a lot of people like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They took us all; and they packed us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you know--not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger trains</span> --and they took us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Thousands of people, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Tell me about the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Describe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, we...we were particularly living at that time, waiting until we get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> ... A lot of families--about 20 families--living in one little <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> waiting for a passport to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But one evening--night rather, middle of night, the Russian Army came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And they just start to wake everybody; and said, "Get up! </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Get up! </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Get up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they just took us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And they took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we were closed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And that's it, until in the morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> started to roll. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So we rolled for stx weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And we passed into each step of the <span class="REGION">Russian country</span> , which was... It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And all of a sudden, we wound up in Siberia-- where there was no... I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">This is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Because in the meantime, we were so many people; and the sanitary things were so unsanitary. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we had three children got sick... My niece--my sister's daughter--at that time she was about 3 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She got also sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">She was among the three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And by the time we stopped at the end, two children died in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my sister's daughter, my niece, they took her off to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because we were waiting for the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So we were left near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomsk</span> , which was <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we worked there; and we got the rations, bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And...
QUESTION:  What kind of work did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I worked...I was cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In order... Anybody that didn't work, didn't get a ration of 400 gram of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, of course, every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in order to get my ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">How do you say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Ration, ration of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So I went to work in the taiga--you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And we were cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , you know, by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , putting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And that's how we earned our bread and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  How did you live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well, we lived... You see, they had those wooden <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that their prisoners lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So they took them someplace else, and they gave those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And, of course, we used to cut our own wood for heating the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> --which was one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...was one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and like two families would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So we would build, like against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> ; you know, from <span class="DLF">wall to wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we slept one next to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">First of all, 1t kept warm; and it saved <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And there we would go...like we would melt the snow for cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Cooking consisted of... I mean, if you got a pound of uh corn kernels, so we used to grind it and it became flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And you boiled the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So...in order it should be a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I mean, it was like 20 people; and everybody should get a spoonful. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So it got thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And you know, you would just look at; and it should get thicker and thicker, you hoped. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">If you didn't add water, so it got thicker. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And everybody would, you know, just get a spoonful and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And that's what kept us going...kept us going, with the hope that some day, you know, that the war will finish and we'll go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Hoping! </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But when we got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , forget it! </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We didn't even go even to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We didn't go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Let's hold <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and stay in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We have time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Well, <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">A lot of people...we didn't have any meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So a lot of...when the sun went down, the light disappeared, they got blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I mean, from lack of vitamins, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">If you don't eat meat, you don't have some kind of vitamin and you get blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So as soon the sun would set, they would get like...and they would walk around like mummies. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they would say, you know, "Please take me here..." And young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But they didn't have the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They didn't have all those vitamins that one needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And my brother was like this, you know; so we had to take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But during the day, he was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">The minute it got a little darker, forget it! </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They went blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I don't know what it was...what would you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And, of course, what, uh... You know, it was very cold there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And in the summer and the spring, like we would go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , there was a lot of... We had to wear veils over our faces, because there were big mosquitos. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And if you got bitten by those mosquitos, a lot of people went crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Crazy, simply crazy; because I don't know what they had in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So they gave us masks, and that's how we used to go to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  How were you treated by the population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Well, uh we were not harassed, because... Well, first of all, we were like in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was only people that were taken, like myself, from...you know, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they put there. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And we didn't see too many people that lived there, because all we saw is the one that . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">How do you say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">My husband tells me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="114">Laughter).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  The prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Prisoners, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So we would see the prisoners when they came from a different <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And my father used to cook the water for them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The cook had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So he used to cook the hot water, and he used to put them with a cup; and he used to give each one a cupful of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I mean, that was the disgusting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Just that, water--to share water. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And you would get a piece of bread, and you would soak it; and they would eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So these are the people actually we saw during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And at night, we used to be among ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Family would always sit and dream and hope and pray that some day this will end, and some day we'll go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> someplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Were you all together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were all together; and with barbed wires, of course, you could not say, "Oh, I don't like it here and I am going to go to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Of course, you couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We didn't run off. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">As a matter of fact, my brother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My brother was very strong, young. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he did try to go away to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They did catch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They did bring him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I mean, they didn't do anything to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They just committed him to a crazy <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They told him that he is crazy, because he decided to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  What happened to him tn the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Well, they kept him and they gave him some medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And he did play along. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He said, "Listen, if they think I am crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">First of all, it keeps me out, you know, from the taiga, from the cutting the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So let me be crazy." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And then if... Later on, he went back to the... I mean, they let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I mean, they didn't harm him or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They didn't physically abuse him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But it was not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In a...1n a way, it was good for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We didn't know at that time; but, you know, fate works in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Did you have much contact with Russian guards? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">How were you guarded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Well, uh there were not too many guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There were just only by the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Because behind you were the taiga, were <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You couldn't run there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Where you gonna go? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You gonna die there with the wolves. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So the only thing, you had the front; and the front was the Russian guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And you had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So you just had to stick to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> with everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  We were there for about a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And then when the war started between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and...and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that's when they liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Army--to fight against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Which my two brothers did. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> , which is a warm climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="179"><span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</span> is near <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  How did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Well, we... At that time, we had some...they did... The Red Cross said...being we were Polish citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So, of course, we didn't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My mother sold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You know, just to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Food was... You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; once you get out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you don't want to be, you could always pick up something...did something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So we got there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> , and we worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Which we didn't need any clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We didn't need any shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We didn't need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And we waited there for the war to be over and to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You didn't just...
ANSWER:  Well, there was also a big community. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so many shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Because my brother once worked in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> ; so he used to work at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So we had only one pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So...but I used to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We used to cut saxaul (ph) all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Grows a certain branch over there, it's called saxhaul (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And this is like corn, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he would send a package to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It was already after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So we should survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  You could save money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Well, we could...just for the train ride; because they wouldn't give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  What were living conditions like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Where did you live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Well, we had a...those <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ... We built our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You know, we would dig earth with straw and--yah, cow manure. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I mean, manure from a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And you step on it...you know, with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then you make forms, and you make brick from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And this would lay like maybe 4 weeks in the sun...in the sun... Being as tropical...you know, tropical climate, it dries. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And this was...we made bricks, and we would build a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And then we would make a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">That's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then we would make a <span class="DLF">roof</span> from the straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So if it got cooler, we would sleep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ; but during the summer, we would sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on mats, straw mats. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Because natives even there, that's how they live. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The Uzbeks, that's how they live. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They eat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So we tried to imitate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Speaking of the Uzbecks, what were your relationships like with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">The Russians? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">What was the relationship with the Uzbeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Well, we didn't see too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Not in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Well, the Uzbeks are... Well, first of all, we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And they are very family-oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So they were together, and they were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And they grow over there melons, all kind of melons. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And we lived on the melons. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We did get a little piece of <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and we used to grow melons. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And uh that's how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They showed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They were very nice to us, the Uzbeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And they showed us how to grow, because we didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And here again, we waited to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="253">laughter) It was one <span class="DLF">line</span> , but then they started... A lot of Russians came when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They started to occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They had a lot of Russia people coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> , [from] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They used to bring the women, the children; and the men used to go to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So that's when we saw a lot of Russian people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But everybody was hungry there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Even they were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Because there was not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">There was... Everybody had to stay with that 400 gram of bread, even the people that were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And that's sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So that's what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But, of course, what my husband went through... It's... You cannot... But we had, because every time like... You know, every time my sister, she would have a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And then she would see--because she was the oldest--she would see that us kids that we were hungry or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So she would take off that dress and go on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And sell it, and get--sell it for bread, not money. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a little bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So then, after a year and a half, there was nothing to sell no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And she got... (Laughing) You know, she was left with her petticoat, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But, Thank God, we all survived. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="272">my sisters and brothers live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and we are happy to be in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">What can I tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Tell me about the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Your parents were with you this whole time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes, we were all the time together. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">All the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  How did they fare with all this travelling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Well, of course, it was my parents were not old. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They were older; but those years... You know, European people, they were not as old in years, but they looked older. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It was...1t was very hard, because they had to constantly take care of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But we tried to uh help them out as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Because uh, you know, they couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So we did work. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We...my sisters ...my...whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Even to go out to dig a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> or pick cotton. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We used to pick cotton. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Or do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Just to earn some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And like the mother: you do have respect for your mother and father, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Even though my father, when we lived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a lot of Jewish people, he would teach them Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He would teach them Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He spoke very good Russian, very good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So he would [teach] the younger people... You see, we always somehow wanted to learn, no matter how. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Not myself just. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I think all the Jewish people are like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">No matter where they are, and what kind of thing, they always... something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But among other things, you have to learn something, too--about the world, about books, about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So my father had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">A little job. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Let's say, if I had a child and I wanted him to learn Jewish--because there was no facility otherwise--so I would give him a piece of bread, a pot of pickles, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And he would teach the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So he got himself... He loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And he was very proud of it; because when he used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he said, "You know, this child, he is so smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He will someday be a good Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="308">You know, he predicted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And uh that's how we survived, and again hoping to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="310">Laughing)
QUESTION:  One more question. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Was there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> ... You're a small group of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Did you form a sort of a mini-Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">There weren't too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Must have been around maybe 30 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">You know, but each family had 3 or 4 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean, my father and my mother was a family; and they had 5 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Or, like my brothers weren't with us because they were in the Army, you know--with the Russians in the Polish Army, fighting with the Russians against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But, of course, we formed . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I was only 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We formed...we were singing, we were dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I used to... I mean, I would have a pair of slippers made. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Over there, you don't go in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Somebody made a pair of slippers. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Which 1s... I mean, like ballet slippers--no bottom or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But this is gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I mean, this was something to have! </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I was young, and I used to love to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So during the day, I would walk around barefooted. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I would not use my slippers. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But that's the slippers I would save for my...at night, to go dancing with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We would sing Jewish, Polish-because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And uh we would try to stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">You know, you just wait and maybe... You know, and people would have some news what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Of course, basically, you would talk about the war, what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And then, later on, you got to know and to learn that people are being killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  How did you hear it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  How did you hear it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well, uh I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">People used to come, like the Russians with their... Now I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The people that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , [from] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> --the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Because they were evacuated to us, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They brought them over. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So they would tell us what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">A lot of the Jews was among them, and they would tell us what was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">What...no paper or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The only thing is we knew that uh if you read... I mean, there was no radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There was a radio like the main radio on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ; and if you walked, you listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I didn't know anybody that had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">No way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Tell me about the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">What happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Well, the end of the war... As I said, my brother was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And at that time, when the end of the war, he just hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroc_aw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Just <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a piece of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> took. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And he send us tickets to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Uh we should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And, of course, we did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I mean, you know, it took us a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Months and months, by the time we get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But being my brother was in the army, so they kind of had a little of respect for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And when we got there, my brother was... Uh, we wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where we were born; but along the way, you found out there is nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">My brother wrote us a letter that there is nobody there. "</span><span class="sentence" id="369">Don't even go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You will just get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Don't go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he [was] stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So he got us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he... That's where we came, to his...to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">From <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But along the way... I mean, we stopped coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> because we had...because this was <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Then we went...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> [NB: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And uh we waited on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you know; because you had to have clearance to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So you have to get some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ... I mean, it was not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ... It was a very uncomfortable <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So if I would go down for water, to get from the pump some water... First my father would go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And my father wore a beard--Jewish--so he encountered some unpleasant, you know, talk about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they decided, being I looked more like a Christian, not a Jewish... So I was sent out, and I would hear... They would say, "Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is giving us Jews and we are giving them coal." </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You know <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> took out all the coals from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and they send in the Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So we decided this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We are going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And my mother had a brother...a sister here. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And we started to find out where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And finally, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And with God's help, we came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I love every minute of 1t. God bless <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> !</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  Tell me about how you met your husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Oh, when I got here in July... Of course, he had to go to work right away to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I went to work, and then... I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Must have been fate or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I decided to go to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where he lived near the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">On <span class="DLF">90th Street</span> [and] <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , and I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> ; but I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="DLF">90th Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don't know what made me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And, of course, he was in a different class and I was in a different class. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We were young, and we got to know one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And that's how love started. (</span><span class="sentence" id="405">Laughter) Something, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  You're quite welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Nice meeting you. </span>
