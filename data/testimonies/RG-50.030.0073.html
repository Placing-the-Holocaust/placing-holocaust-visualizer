<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Hello, Mr. Fried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Could you please give me your name, your date of birth and your place of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name is Viliam Fried. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I had been born in 1919, October 25th, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lozin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">It's in the <span class="REGION">East Slovakia</span> , County Michalovee. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and around this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was living most people of my family until we can say '39, until the <span class="REGION">Slovak state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">After this time many moved from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and according to all the sisters and brothers of my mother, my mother was leaving, after my father died, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cragovsky Hermits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It's a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">South Slovakia</span> , but mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And she was there up to '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Myself, I was living there by my grandfather up to '33 and in 1933 when I finished something like <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> here in the States, I went to work to the <span class="BUILDING">Battah Company</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And this was the first short part of my ride and the main things, but maybe it's necessary to say, that the community around was Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around there have been two, three, four, maybe five Jewish families, mostly working like farmers, except maybe they had their little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> or they, something else, a <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> , selling cigarettes and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Only in.the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovce</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> , the Jewish community was stronger, more families and, of course, all what it means to be Jewish, was concentrated in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My father died when I was five-and-a-half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother stayed with three children and she was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungrad</span> , like a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">After she, I don't know how she came to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , looking for a nurse who can deliver babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So my mother went to work for these two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arcan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And my brother and my sister and my mother, they had to, they lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> up to 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Myself, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> once or two times a year on vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Otherwise I was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zlene</span> , it's the heart of the Battah concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Maybe you heard about the Battahs, or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I'm sure that yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And working, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and living like all the other young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">All the other members of the family, I mean, my uncles and their children, my aunts and their children, were living all around me, (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was always so in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> that they married to somebody from the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because the communication wasn't so easy at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about your job in the <span class="BUILDING">Battah factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Your job at the <span class="BUILDING">Battah factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Can you tell me a little about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">Battah factory</span> I started to teach and to work in the Department of Chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Tire and Rubber .. Department, and it was so that every day at six o'clock we went to make a little sport 15 minutes, then take a breakfast, went to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , working until two o'clock, take ahlunch, and at five o'clock it was finished with the work, and at six o'clock we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , every day up till ten o'clock at evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And on Saturdays, the whole day, it was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  What kind of work did you do in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ? .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  I was learning how to build tires, how to build, it's a kind of, you have it in the engine, belts, rubber boots, and I was learning these professions and except of this in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I wanted to achieve, graduate, in chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was, I was very ambitious, I can say, when I was young and I have done everything to be a good scholar, a good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I was saving money from my wages to help my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And except of this, if you are wanted by the company, after you have been half ready to move forwards, you must have money because you must show the bosses in these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> that you are able to make money and to spend money in a good way. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I was working there up to '38.. In 1938 I have to go to the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I was 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And so I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my mother, because I have to go to the Army November 1, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But, if you remember, 1938 was a heavy year in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was partly occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Part of the <span class="REGION">South Slovakia</span> was occupied by the Hungarians and so it came through that in 1939 I think it was in February or so, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was divided in two parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">One <span class="NPIP">part</span> .. was fully occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It was like a Gubernia. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> should be a self, a sovereign state. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But it was built under the parasol from Mr. Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And it was very bad for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Because, as I told you before, my mother was living with the two younger brother and sister in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Each was occupied by the Hungarians in 1938, on the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And because my brother and my sister, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Slovak schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My mother had very near to some, the bureaucrats was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , it was mostly Slovak and Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So when the Hungarian come in, they gave us about 48 hours time. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We could take 40 kilo luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They took us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with horses to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cragovsky Hermits</span> , concentrated with other groups of Slovaks and Czechs, and carried us by track, near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ushahrot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Usharot</span> was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on the, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Putkarpaskaros</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but mostly the community was half Ruttish and half <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then we came at night to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and they told us, "You have to go in this direction." </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We had been more hundred people, we have to go in this direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And so we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It takes about maybe three hours or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was a terrible night for us because it was the first step to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I will explain you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">For example, my brother, he's younger than I am, now he is living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was a professor of chemistry here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my sister, she is living here, mother of my nephew. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My brother became sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And so my mother put him on her. . [ </span><span class="sentence" id="70">shoulders and she was carrying him. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He was about maybe 100 | pounds or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The whole night, through a <span class="REGION">land</span> which was frozen and falling down and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My sister, she went by mother and [ taking her skirt, and I was getting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">| came on the other side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We didn't know if we are in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , but we saw lights, we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishna Yametskayorso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And there we find people who were in the same situation as we. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Many, many, many, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And so we get some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And the next day we move by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Michalovce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And why to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovce</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Because it was the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we have some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And of course we wanted to come to somebody who was able for a short time to give us help. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So it happened that our family, from all the families belonging to our big family, as 1t was so, wanted to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But we had divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Mother went to one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My brother went to another uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My sister went to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Because nobody was able to take the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I, in a short time, about in, I was living by my friend, Mr. Klein, he was the last years in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and from this time in about 10 weeks or so, I went into the Slovak Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I became a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">After two weeks I went to <span class="BUILDING">officer's school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I was in the Army like a normal soldier maybe up to September. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But it's not exactly, nearly so. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Then it came, in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the Nuremburg rules, made by Mr. Gerbers and his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The Slovakian government take it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And tpey .. started to write in the newspapers, "We will make better rules than Hitler made. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">No Jew can stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He cannot longer stay here because the <span class="REGION">land</span> belongs to our Christian people." </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And the effect of this was, for example, that all the Jewish 6 soldiers, they take away from the Army and put in a, um, in working groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I But it's very interesting that, for example, me, I was S in the so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but I stay in the same <span class="BUILDING">office</span> as I | was before in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was handling the same (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="103">papers as | before, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Because I don't know why, but it was so. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it was until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I went from the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It came a new rule | that all the young men have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civil labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And so I [ went to work on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">railway building camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It was a <span class="DLF">railway</span> | between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stratski</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preshov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I stayed there a longer time. [ </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had luck, because some of the engineers, they had been my | friends, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, for the first years, since I was 12, 13, | 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And so I worked there, I get money, I could make a normal living. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was until 1941 or so and between, as I was a soldier, 11 so the Germans had partly occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> before they started F the war against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovce</span> , where I was | a soldier, it was a place where it was an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> for the Army F only, a <span class="BUILDING">field airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And you know how it is, if you are young | you sometimes get in troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we get once in troubles with such soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And so I get a big help from my commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I | told him early in the morning what happened, and he was helping .. me, but it's not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">| And from this time, as I went from the Army, it doesn't take too many times, you could hear that something will be done with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Nobody, one said that we have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to 71, build a new life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Somebody thought we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , but in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And on the beginning of 1942 one of my friends in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I don't remember exactly, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lustotsi</span> or so, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They told me, "Viliam, you have to be prepared that they will take all the young boys and girls to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I ask him from where you have the news, so he told me, "I have connections, I know it." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I was contacting my mother and told her that maybe I will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and maybe even to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> to try to go to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> because many of young people went this time from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palestina</span> , and to, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , on the front, between <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Libya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was a place where they have concentrated soldiers, officers, people who would run away from the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My mother started to cry, "What shall I do here with the kids?" </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They were not kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My brother was about 19 and my sister 16, yeah, 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I told my mother, "I don't know exactly, but it will be very bad." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I will take my sister, Rose, with me, and she will stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Maybe she could make a normal life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Asven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And, really, it came very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They took the young people who was not married to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Popravitz</span> in the high Tatras. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">From this <span class="NPIP">place</span> they make, they organize transports .. and send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Midonic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denbrin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Midonic</span> , according to what I, as I heard, they killed there about 250,000 young people during the half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They was not really killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They must work, and they didn't get | | nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They couldn't sleep even in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span> , only. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And you know how it is, it comes typhus, and then you lose every | night a hundred souls. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">| When I heard that it happened, I have a girlfriend, I W went to her parents and I told them I am moving to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and if you want I can take Edith and the same day I went to my mother, I told her I take Rose with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So it happened this, my friend, | made me a meeting with the police and they told me between 10 and 11 o'clock you can pass the fronchar from here up to here, kilometer, this and this, because nobody will be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So we passed the fronchar, we went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="REGION">Hungarian territory</span> before it was <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It was a family, we came in, they knew about such transportations because they used the people, the young people used this channel very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The girls stayed by this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I came to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sejose</span> , and told her that Rose is in Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the next night I moved again to Hungarian and take her to do something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And you know what the first question from my mother was? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was Saturday, and, "How do you came here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I told her, "By a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And she told me, "Today is Sabbath." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was very, very heavy for me, but it was, as I told you, the next night, with the help of my friends, I passed again the fronchar, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalani</span> , we had some Hungarian money, and the next day we went with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shatarajawihe</span> , and by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> , it was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="REGION">East Slovakia</span> , about 60,000 inhabitants, and to stay there and to decide what to do further. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It's, maybe it is a question of why I went so around and not straight with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the girls have been, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through <span class="REGION">Hungarian territory</span> that used to be before <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And custom officers went together. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So it was a danger that we would be detained, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We stayed there about three or four days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The girls have been by the grandmother of my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And me and the old friend of mine, an older gentlemen, Mr. Greenstein, he helped me to get some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and during one hour we had money for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Because for the same reasons, we have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Usharot</span> where we had a very large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My mother, cousins and adult children and we wanted that one of them should go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we used to live before we must go to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">To get some papers that we were living in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> from 1927 until 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But he couldn't arrange it, Mr. Greenstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He died here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We arranged the next route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We were very good in Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We could speak Hungarian like all other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But sometimes it, the police made controls in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We came from the front, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from the fronchar. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we heard the people talk about the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , what they are doing with Jewish 10 people, and that many are running to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungaria</span> , so we have been afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But we came through, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> I have a halfsister. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We had the same father but not the same mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The

<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  What year, what time is this now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  It is exactly the 4th May, 1942, as we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovece</span> , this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And it takes about two days, as we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> where they concentrated some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The Jewish people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indirhed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And then about 1,000 people from our transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It was exactly 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">25 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> per 40 persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we fell in German hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The S.S., dogs, schnell, schnell, schnell, and before you could see what's happened somebody kicked you in your leg or in your ass and we saw that it's not a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And so we went in such a group to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Some old people were sitting in. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I saw the first time fully digressed people sick, full with this, I don't know how you call it, but you have in your head, if you are not clean enough.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And not only in their head, but even inside the skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was sick when I saw this. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So I was sure that it will not be a joke to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then we moved on different <span class="NPIP">places</span> to different codes, in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And as I saw what kind of 14 VILI~ FRIED accommodation we get, I was sure it was only for summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">That we have not make any questions how it will be in winter, because I was sure that in winter nobody will exist from these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The next day came the president of the Udenterat. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It was also the Jewish, uh...
QUESTION:  Council.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He spoke very good Czech because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> like a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He had a big <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minziret</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He was a nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And they take everybody who was able to work, men. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We had been about 310 girls and we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rogosnetchka</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visokov</span> where it was only one big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And near to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was beginning the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we started to work in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> making wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I don't know for whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And the part of us were working to building a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> for this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was in the middle of May, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Nearly to the end of July we get information that the families left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> was taken away to, away. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Meanwhile, we could go to Milingihed to take what was left from ours, and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know why it's crazy to tell it, but the only way to come through the first month in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was to sell everything what you have on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">First the jacket, then a shirt, then the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Because the people, I mean, the Polish people was all so poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And if you want to have a little milk or you want to have maybe five kilo potatoes, you have to give up a pair of socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">No money. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">15 So we take some things and went to, back, and then sometimes we can go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It was not permitted, but not on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> , through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> you can achieve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we went, we had some connections to a family, they had a small <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for landscape matins. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We met, his name was about Yaborchek or Yaborsky or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And they explained to us what is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Because two brothers who went with the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> as our families in July, they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We wouldn't believe that all is true what they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We asked if it is so that they have there so many S.S., so many Ukraine policemen, so many Lithuanian killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">How could you escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And so the younger told me it was very easy, but others, Jewish members help us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We are working in a group which was loading shoes, clothes and other things what the people bring to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And in the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , it was evening, we stay in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , but they didn't close the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And so when we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinki</span> we could open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to jump from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But in a few days I heard that somebody was telling that they escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinki</span> and the German S.S., they take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we have been sure, and so we have very good contact to the Polish people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, for example, in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was a man, his name was Hijuc, he was very sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He has a big sympathy to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he allowed us to make a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and my cousin and two other men and one boy from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I 16 don't remember exactly, but the name of this boy was Edek. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He was about, say, 17, 18 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He helped us to make the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , to buy some food, I mean, potatoes and such things. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we are expecting when they came to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I came not very often but once, two times a week, but in connection with a German and Polish administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So if I would go away, so maybe it wouldn't be so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But these three boys, they went away and they stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And the next day, I don't remember, it was maybe a week or ten days or so, really one day afternoon came <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , Latvanian and German S.S. men, and they started to shut and take us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They took us on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and they brought us, on each track, to soldiers with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> and we stayed on the square sitting on the stones and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I have seen there very many awful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I saw how they killed small children one year or so only, take by the foots and broken their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I knew that it is the beginning of the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">At evening we went to a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and put, we spoke about that we destroy the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was only from wood, and we try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But then somebody from the Germans and we saw that machine guns had been around, five, six machine guns, we .. could do it, but the percentage of success, maybe five, maybe ten percent, not more. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The next day we went on the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We came then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">.In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukof</span> they connected more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went slowly, slowly, 17 slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We saw that we are passing <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherletz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And we knew that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherletz</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , the next <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> on the right side, not the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> ; but the <span class="DLF">railway road</span> , is to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markeniza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markeniza</span> was the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And we knew what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> means. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So everybody started, we was thinking how to, what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> they have been not covered already, but only wires with nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So we tried to lock them. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Maybe we could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherletz</span> we passed a main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">As we came out you feel it because when you are going through this <span class="DLF">crossingways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> made a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And somebody opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and a German soldier came in and asking, "Schnell, schnell, schnell." </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And somebody gave him 500 Latien. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So it was not enough for him, so he was always urging, "More, more money, more (?)." </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And between we heard that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> 1s moving, "Whoo," that it wants to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I don't know what happened, but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I was there, very near. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Somebody took a wire on his neck, we called it a Satirian tie, and the German was ready, he couldn't make a noise or something, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So it was the way for us to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And so the people, the boys and the older people, started to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And of course I have done the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I was lying a short time until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> passed away, and then I stand up and near to me a second man that came to me, "Where we go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I told him, "I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I don't know where I 18 am." </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But I told him, or he told me, first, far, we have to go from the <span class="DLF">railway

She doesn't tell me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> "</span><span class="sentence" id="433">In this direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And many of the people jump from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="435">From <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , but mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , they brought the Jews not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> like us, but in regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> for, like for civil people, for civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And so it was easy for them to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And she told me, "And the gendarmarie is in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they are shooting a lot of people."

QUESTION:  Would you continue your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  And, as I mentioned before, I was not sure if Mr. Borlinsky, or what was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He will come back with the money or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So I decided to go away without money but with my, on my legs and healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And the next way, my way was to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where Mr. Hichug was the boss and where we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , to my friends, and to arrive there and to try to jump on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , not on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , but on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to try to come backeto, not to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was sure that if I will come back I could stay alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> because I had some good friends and I could have Christian papers and it would be not a problem for me to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But as I came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> to Mr. Hichug, and to this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , to my cousin and two other boys, they told me they tried, it's impossible because on some <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is breaking and going slower that you can jump on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , it's impossible to go in, because the Germans are very, they are, they have special guards on these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . .. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So I talked to this Mr. Hichug and he told me that maybe it would be good for you and for Edek, it was these Polish people, to make some contacts here in this part, in direction <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodava</span> in this big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I heard that there are some Soviet 23 soldiers and they are living in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and maybe you could go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So why only me and this Edek? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Because the other people, they're too, I would say, too Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And so I decided with Edek that we will go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  What do you mean by "too Jewish"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  You have to know that the Polish people, and even some Ukraine people, they don't like Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They have been, I would not say the whole nation, but many of them have been very big anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And by the word Jew, sometimes they wouldn't help you, and not only help you, but even they, it has been many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I could speak about the actual cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That a family, take a Jewish family, and in the first 100 meters of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> they kill them and took away what they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It happens, such things. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So I went with Edek and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerotine</span> , and to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And the next night we met two Russian soldiers, not partisan this time, and we spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Ah, so and so, but have you weapon, have you this? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">No, we haven't. "</span><span class="sentence" id="487">Have you been a soldier?" </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I told yes, I was a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I was in an <span class="BUILDING">officer's school</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="490">So come with me, come with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And so they took us to their group. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It wasn't a real group of organized partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I say it was a group of people who want to live, and the only one .. way how to come through was to have a gun and to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And because my situation was the same I didn't went to them for a reason that I will fight again Germans, becauss it, what can do I alone against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But I wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And to stay in 24 2 this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> in the wintertime, it was not very good because first of all the snow on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> wasn't so constant-like around. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">The second, if you are going here and there you will leave, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So I saw that even Mr. Hichug wasn't happy that we are on his <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I mean, this Mr. Hichug, he was the boss about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So I decided to stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I told them that I am from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and so, but only the truth, because I knew that they have been so afraid, as I was, because their life was not guaranteed. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So we went together. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">They have certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where they have their <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and what they have done, they have built some good connections with certain families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Did these soldiers know you were Jewish at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  I didn't tell them, they didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I, maybe that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But according what I spoke to them it was about 20 people or so, I know that in name only, not in the family name, but only on Peorta, Avon, Volodya, Rishar, and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">One man, I mean, Peorta Dugi. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He was a very tall.man. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He was working like a commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">But he was not in a shot that he was a lieutenant or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He was the strongest and he was maybe clever enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He knew something about how to move irregular. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And he was quite good in preparing, preparing material for destructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And this was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And then, as I told, as I mentioned, they had to many families very 25 good connections to Polish people and Togram people. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And these connections was made on the fact that if they had something from the Germans so they divided it with the people around, because they had been very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And except of this, they need weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The Poles, I know why, but this time I couldn't understand, because it was a big danger for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And so, if this group decided to do something it was not because they get some orders from higher commandant oW so. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Only to get everything what they need for their, for our living and then to show the Germans that somebody is there, is here, who can do something against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I personally had very good, also very good connections to some Polish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I, from the day as we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I learned Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I read newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I read books to learn the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Because I know that the language can help me very much if I have to live between them, because such a possibility was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But this winter was really a very, very strong winter, '42, '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Outside it was sometimes 25, 30 degree celsius. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I don't know how much, but it's more, it's hundred, I don't know .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Below zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Below zero, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And we have been unable .. to live so. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So some of this group went to Polish families and they have been hidden and so I told them that even I have the possibility to move and promised that in the Spring we will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I come back to this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , to Mr. Hichug, but my 26 friends haven't been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They have been in another <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">In such a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where in the summertime the horses have been, the horses which were working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And so, as I came there, we decided to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It was not a decision, but I thought, "I am going back." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And we send, Mr. Hichug arranged us, that somebody went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minziret</span> and was going around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to look if there is alive, or who is there, and so, and he came back and told us yes, he saw people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were not closed, so that the Jewish people who stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> can move free. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So I decided to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but it was the end of February, middle of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And I met some people who I knew, even from our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">It was a boy from the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , Freddie. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I don't remember his other name. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And then the second one, Joseph. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And later came my cousin, and to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Victor. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It was good, because we hadn't been <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but we haven't a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live because all these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> have been full with people sick, and typhus was very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And my cousin died on typhus on this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">After the Spring, it was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So, and we were working in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where before have been <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> , and some bring all what it was in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The commandant of this works was a German gendarme. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He was, I wouldn't say that he was good, but he was very correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">A very simple man, very correct and I wouldn't say that he was very lucky, what happened to part of people like 27 we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And he was also every evening collecting from us all the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Some money, what we found, or some rubles in gold, or some Polish money or some jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Because we have to go through all the pieces of cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And, of course, we were working something, even of our own invoice, but not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And in the middle of, it could be spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was spring, it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Maybe April or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">One of our Czechoslovak, from our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , was in, he was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And, you know, "Kraviats, kraviats." </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It means a tailor in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He was working by the farmers and if we had in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> not 200, only 185 people, nobody knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So he was working and getting food and so bringing for us, and he send a lady, she was a widow, a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I think her name was Stefaniska. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">She has a son, he was nearly the same age as I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I was sometimes, as we worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , maybe two or three times in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">She came in near to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and she asked for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They called me Panvilek, Vilek. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So somebody told me, "Here is a Polish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">She wants to talk to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="575">A

class="sentence" id="578">That he wants that I come to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So I told her, "I don't know, I talk to my friends, if yes or not." </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But later, in a few days, I decided to go. .. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Mrs. Stefaniska came. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I told her that I will go, but I will move

"</span><span class="sentence" id="593">What kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I explained what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , it was. "</span><span class="sentence" id="595">Where did you live the last weeks?" </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I told them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and former I was here, and I was in connection, and I worked together with your friends on this part. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They told me, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We went in, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and after three, four or five hours, I don't know how exactly, we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there have been <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and I was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And the next day I spoke to a man, according to his, I don't know how to explain, he was, I saw that he was an intelligent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He knows something about <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and about different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I know because he was asking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And he told me, "Okay." .. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And so I didn't get any weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I started to work first near the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And then I don't know, I cannot remember exactly how it happened, he came to me.and he told me, "You speak German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I told him, "Yes."

<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  What were the other people like in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">What was the environment in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Was it...
ANSWER:  In that part of the Vitrosher, and I think so it was even so in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , the Germans didn't make any difference between a friend of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and an enemy of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">For them it was only a Ukraine or a white Russian, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They don't like them, they hate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And they don't, they don't act with the people like with human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">The horse had a bigger value for them like a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And so it happened that the whole <span class="REGION">territory</span> was a <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They have been, they have occupied the whole <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But they have been the bosses on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> only until the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">When the night came, no German could move alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Even if he could, he was afraid to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Because everybody was his enemy, every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , every ten years old boy was his enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Not because they hate the Germans, because they are Germans, but they hate them, what they have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">For example, if we made an attack on a German group. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which was near to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the people was killed and they burned up the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Because their mind was that if somebody has done here, has made here an attack against us he must have connection with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They have been right. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But 30 the connection was only with few people, not with the whole people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And so it happened that families with children came in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because they haven't got other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">They couldn't live alone <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And, of course, who was able to fight, he was a partisan who not the boys, 10, 12 years, they have been very good spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You could send them here and there to have a look what's happened here, how many soltdiers are on this <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , how it looks there. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And this, my commandant, later, I don't know if it was at the same time as I came, he should be in his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Many of the intelligence things, what have been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">If in the first time the program of the partisans was, it's only my combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I have no documents to, if in the first time was to fight the Germans, at this time, when the Germans came, they have been bitten by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and by, I don't know, and different other <span class="NPIP">places</span> to (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So the Soviet army was more active. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So the main, uh, the main, I can say it in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The main thing that the partisans have to do to protect the people which was living around, and to enable for the enemy, I mean, for the Germans, to send troops to the East, to enable them to send ammunition, food and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It means to spoil the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , to spoil the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , to spoil the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And by this .. Mr. Gulevich, our group was about 12, 13 in this 100, 120 group, was to, if they catch the German or two Germans or more, to press them to get information from which battalion they are, what they are doing here, if they are expecting reserves. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Everything what, 31 | | if you have been a soldier you know what it is to assemble information about your enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And to translate it, if we get a | map. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">If we get some other documents to make translations, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">g If we, we had a <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> and they always try, they was try | to catch something in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And then from this small 0 information, to translate it, and to do something with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So it was very good for me that I didn't, I never asked nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I get... . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  Let me take you back just a little bit to your group. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">What nationality, do you know the nationalities of the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It was, the normal soldiers had been partly from Russian prisoners who run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">From young men and some girls from the <span class="REGION">counties</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But the top organizatorsf they came by parachute, paradesance. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It was mostly the commandant and the professional soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">They came, the professional officers, they came from, with parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But the commissar, you know what the commissar means? </span><span class="sentence" id="662">The political leading came mostly from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we have been working because they knew everybody and I think that the organization of the communistic party was nearly the same as it was in the pre .. .. war time, but not with the same people. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Somebody was the president of the communist party in a <span class="REGION">county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">When the Germans came in, when the invasion was, when the war was, so he was still the boss, and his word was the last word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  Most of the civilians were Poles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Not most. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was mostly white Russian and Ukraine people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  Let me, can you pinpoint the <span class="REGION">geographic area</span> now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  The <span class="REGION">geographic area</span> was if you take the map you see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Breslitoks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It's on the <span class="DLF">river bank</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And it's main traffic point where the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and the <span class="DLF">railway roads</span> are dividing in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">If you are looking directly to the east there are the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and other communications through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pinsk</span> , on the southern border of white <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">In the northwest direction the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and rails to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitepsk</span> , to the middle of white <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and more to the left to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pinsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It was the capital of white <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pinsk</span> and this <span class="DLF">road</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitepsk</span> , this was the place where we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">kIl the groups, even, it means our group has more <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It 1s to explain so, that you have to build a part of our soldiers, of our members, they were mostly working on a replace basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">It means that if you want to move from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> you must know where, and you must have a <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> with food, with ammunition, because you, sometimes you haven't time, if you are running away from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to take everything with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So we .. had maybe sometimes 50, 60 kilometers, it's about 30, 40 miles, an <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we had three, four <span class="NPIP">reserve places</span> where we could move only with our, with a gun, and with the necessary personal things. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">All other was on these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So that the part was building these <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> under there and taking there ammunition reserves, what we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">This was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So that if we want to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kopanitse</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We knew that we have to move to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And the exact <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it was, we knew from the, not we knew, but the information, we get the information from the people living around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> or in isolated <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And then we have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I'm in an action to operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was impossible to do something, the same thing on the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> two times, or three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So if we, at evening we went out and prepared action to catch one or three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> which went alone on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So we went to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We have a certain style how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Mostly it was made so that in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , here was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on this side and on this side, and you take a very strong wire, you take it on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and when it was late evening, late afternoon, and you saw something, so somebody run on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and take the <span class="DLF">wire</span> on the other, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was maybe 50, 60 or more kilometers he came to this <span class="DLF">wire</span> and, you know, it was like a knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And then the 20 people from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , 20 from other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but not everybody, if somebody was officer it was a very good fish for us, or if somebody has this, well, he .. has the maps, it was also very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So mostly we take these people and we don't need nothing from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Maybe some food or some weapons or some 34 ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And you have to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Not to the nearest <span class="NPIP">base</span> , but somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about the leader of your group and some of the other missions that you participated in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  So my leader, he was an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They called him Coroner. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">If he was a real coroner or not, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He was about 35 years old, a nice man, educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And he knows very well about radio and this connections what you use in a rod if you have to give through information. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And he was the owner of the code.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Gurevich. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">If it was his real name or not, everyone called him Tovaish Comrade Gurevich. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I had a friend, he was, I think so, he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He didn't tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He was a Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">His name was Schlezinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We had been together, he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And we had been together, but after a certain time they take him away to another group. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And we met after nearly eight months, again, in the Czechoslovak army. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And meanwhile it was so that the Germans have moved too many men and ammunition and weapons to the east, and from the information we saw that they prepare something in these parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And I don't know exactly when it was, the date, but it was a very, very hard fight in which the Russians take about 50, 60,000 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">If you know more about the second World War, it was the group which Stalin decided that, it was 11 generals, third marshals, high officers, a lot of them, and soldiers, and it was the group which usually has been the nearest to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And Stalin in his big speech, he told, "You are the generals and the marshalls who want to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So I will enable you to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And they took them and they was 24 hours marching through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> like prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You know how it was for such gentlemen like these Marshalls were, have been, not were. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And the, you know what they had already done, when they went through so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> which are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> washing the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I don't know how you, they are spraying water to clean the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , went after them because nothing can stay in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Must be cleaned when the Germans went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So after this big fight more of the groups, we have neighbors on the right side and on the left side, but I will tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I didn't, I mentioned it, I didn't want to ask very much, because it was not good, especially for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And, because I wasn't Soviet and it was, I wanted, I don't know what I wanted, I wanted to came over the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So we passed through the rest of the German groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They have been totally destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">The morale and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We came to, it was near, I think so, it was near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orsha</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in white <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And we passed through the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span> , all, mostly all, I mean, our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And then we went to the next commandatura. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It was the institution which was collecting, not soldiers, and prepare them 36 to take them into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And the partisans was not really real soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And there I said that I'm from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They asked me if I wanted to be a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I told them yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I couldn't say no, because otherwise they would take me to forced labor, I don't know where.</span></p>
