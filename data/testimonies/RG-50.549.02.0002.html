<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  That was very strange experience because we had to leave Europe during 1942, at the time when the transatlantic travel was very rare and we were extremely fortunate to get a little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> on one of the rare <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that went from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But by no means directly because they, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> tried to avoid the <span class="DLF">mine</span> , the <span class="DLF">mines</span> of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and we went first to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> then to the Bermudas and finally, we ended up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Virginia Beach</span> but we didn’t know we were, where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We just ended up and the immigration officers came on board and processed us on board and then when finally we were allowed to leave the when they agreed, they were afraid that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> contained spies and or, any other people they didn’t wish to come on, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And that was their main concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And so not everybody got off. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So those that were allowed to get off finally were...
QUESTION:  Blindfolded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Blindfolded and we were guided to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were, was also blindfolded and we couldn’t look <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we didn’t know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We didn’t know we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Virginia Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then something very nice happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We received something to eat and...
QUESTION:  Were you blindfolded at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Then of course they took it off in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> they took it off because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was black. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You couldn’t see anything anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And they gave us sandwiches and I, I don’t think I’ll ever forget my astonishment at the white bread that was given to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">During the war and I thought this was a special welcome gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  You later found out this was...
ANSWER:  Your daily bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then we were, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left, we weren’t told where we were going and we landed, not landed, we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Penn Station</span> , <span class="DLF">34" Street</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We were told you’re on your own and here we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  So there you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">What were your impressions of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, we didn’t quite know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Here we were, we weren’t prepared for, for that and we had very little money and so we had to decide what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So we actually decided to split up because, and everybody, we all had friends and family here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but they had no clue that we had arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And so we didn’t want to overwhelm any, any one in particular so we said it’s best we go each to one person and then maybe they can put us up and that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And they did put us up very kindly, each one of us separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  And what did you think of, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Yeah, I walked the first day, already, on my arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I walked from <span class="DLF">34” Street</span> to, I think <span class="DLF">86" Street</span> on the <span class="REGION">west side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was overwhelmed and I must say the, the word freedom became something of meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It, you were free to go without showing a paper, without identifying yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That was my, my really, the first impact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Did you talk about that at all with people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Just a feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I think this the first time that I mentioned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  And you were 17, 18 at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  And you’d never really experienced this kind of freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Because, not anyway, in the, as a child I had experienced that freedom, but not as a teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Did it take some getting used to? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Was it strange?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  No, I, I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It and I, and that for me is the essence of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I, I, now even more shocked than a person who hasn’t experienced that at the necessity of writing the social security on everything you, you hand in now. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Before when I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you needed nothing, absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You gave your name, everybody believed you and if, if, if you, if they asked you do you have an identification and you took out an envelope from a letter that you got yesterday, that was sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And that was, that, I thought was marvelous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  And this was after having been asked for your papers at every <span class="DLF">checkpoint</span> 
ANSWER:  Exactly, exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  You were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">What, how did the teachers and, and your fellow students respond to you as, as a, aS an immigrant, as someone who’d come from such a horrible experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Actually, nobody asked me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The only person who realized that was a teacher who, whose job actually it was to deal with children whose mother tongue 1s not English. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And she was, she knew it, I think, about my background and she was very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">She collected clothes that I needed but she didn’t let me know that she gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She just, it appeared where I was sitting or she just gave, she never wanted to be thanked for it but I knew she must have been, she had collected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And, and mostly marvelous clothes that I had never even had before, such beautiful clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the, the co-student, my students, colleagues never asked me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the fact that my English was very poor of course, was very noticeable and in fact, it was non-existent in, in the first few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I learned fast but it, the first few weeks it was non-existent and so you tended to go, we had to eat at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so you tended to go and sit with children that you could talk with. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French table</span> was sort of brought together with little refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we got to know each other because of the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Did you know any other Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  I, these children were Jewish mostly, my little friends, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  And did you discuss the, where you had come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Did you discuss the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Oh, we, we told each other our stories, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  You did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I remember my Belgian friend came from a diamond family and my, and I, and my French friend came from a doctor’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Eventually when you learned how to speak English better, did you then talk about
ANSWER:  No, because it, I wasn’t asked no. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The only thing, where I talked about actually is when I left Europe I was given certain letters and documents by a variety of people to bring to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which I kept on me with great care. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact the Quaker in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that was very important because the Quakers had given their support to the Luchombon (ph) Project and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph) was entirely dependent on their financial help. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And so that was one of the first things I did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and they asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my experience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their support, to hear about it from firsthand. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And there’s a little story, aside, 1s a lady came up to me and she said, would I agree to stay with her during the summer and be a companion to her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And that was in springtime and so that seemed very far away and I agreed of course, yes I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then when I did spend time with that family in the summertime, what she really wanted me to do is to teach her child German. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And to me, that was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I didn’t want to speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That was the language of the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But I didn’t want to disappoint her either. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So I did teach the child German but it was, it was a great insight to my person, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And I, I mention this because nobody would think of that, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You, you don’t think you, this little girl speak, this not little, this young girl speaks German so why shouldn’t she speak German with, I, I can understand her now very well but at that time, 1t made me very unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Did you talk to anyone else aside from the Quakers about, about your experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">When did you begin to talk to, more, more openly and were people willing to listen to your story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  I, it’s hard to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I cannot give you a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There was no particular time when I started to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was very occupied with doing my schoolwork and I, without being asked, I would not have started anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And you weren’t asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  And, and nobody, nobody asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Why do you think that is?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Well, to come back what I had said, I felt that as a such a young child, she could not deal with this information, she would hate the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> she is in, she would hate every individual for doing what they did to their parents, that’s the way I imagined she would react because that’s certainly the way I would react if I had heard this from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And it would not be a happy life for her to have to deal with this problem, with this psychological problem so we postponed to tell her when she was old enough to deal with it and we told her and it was a great shock to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And, but she, she was very loyal and she, she felt very much with us and she, that’s the way it is today.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  How do you think that experience sort of shapes who you are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  It entirely shaped who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I, I’m not a psychiatrist but isn’t any experience shaping the person entirely, and even the unconscious? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, I mean that is always what defines you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Well my, the, the greatest influence of my war experience certainly is to apply for the job at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I, I had up till then worked to, with the <span class="DLF">medical library field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My last job was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where I built up the <span class="BUILDING">medical library</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there and a colleague of mine drew my attention to the advertisement in, in one of the Washington papers for that, they advertised for the job of the librarian of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I thought I was well qualified for what they asked and I applied and obviously they agreed with my desire to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And the experience I had gathered contributed of course immensely to this job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  How many years did you work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I got the position in ’89. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And I resigned in ’95.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Working there contribute — every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Every minute of my work I learned something new and it was fascinating for me to work with the material I worked with. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And to build this <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , I, I, when I came we had just a few hundred books on, on a few shelves and, and some <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on “<span class="DLF">L” Street</span> and when I left, we had a full- fledged <span class="BUILDING">library</span> which was my joy to build up. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Also from an architectural point of view since I had had that experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , working directly with the architects, I, I had also this opportunity here and I worked very closely with Freat (ph) who is the architect of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and who is also a refugee child. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And so we had a lot in, in common and it was a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We could, to build up this <span class="BUILDING">library</span> from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Why did you want to work at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Because of my past experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You asked were there anything in my decision, in my career decisions was related to my past experience and that is the reason I applied. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I felt now finally I can do something to, to bring this part of my life out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Is there, is there any one, I asked you this about your work at the New York Public Library, is there any one instance or moment or document or anything that, that stands out during your time at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial</span> that you came across that had a profound impact on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There is a book published by Klassfelds (ph) which describes the transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and is very comprehensive and one day we, when it came out, of course we acquired it as soon as possible and as, when it arrived, I opened it to the name Earnest Koenig and here described when and under what circumstances Earnest was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> to, I mean it didn’t, not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and it didn’t describe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It only mentioned his name but it described the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  And you didn’t know this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  [had never seen it before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  And what impact did that have on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  It, it’s a shaking up experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I, I, now in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , the majority of questions of people who come in now are trying to trace what happened to their ancestors and I was obliged to show them and have them, have the same experience that I had and it was very difficult for me to do that but I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I , working when you work with people in the reference and I knew exactly how they would feel when they saw the names of their loved ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Had Earnest talked to you much about that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  No, he and I, and, and perhaps that was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I took that for his not wanting to talk about it and I do not know whether I was correct in this assumption. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I, I just assumed that if he wished to talk it, he would start the conversation on, on the subject and I was not going to initiate or push or, I was always there to listen if he wished to open up. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And it was very slow in coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  And has he since?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  In the past

<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Do you feel as though you and Earnest have sort of a bond or a connection because of, your experiences are different during the war but you, you did have, were persecuted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Yes of course, certainly, one does have such a unique bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Do you consider yourself a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Iam a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But so are other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I mean if you are, if you survive a fire, you’re a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So, I mean this, the, the, the term survivor today has broadened enormously. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And on the one hand, on the other hand, it sort of particularized by a certain group. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So I, it’s hard to answer, do you, I think I know what you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  I was actually getting at whether you and Earnest agree on, on that term, whether you both agree whether you’re a survivor because in the classic sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  Oh, you, I tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I have found out that the people who come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> think that that term is sort of reserved for Auschwitz survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I’ve met a lot since then and they do not consider me a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So on people or maybe also in perhaps other of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , think the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">When I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> it might include the other four, five death, extermination, I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Do you and Earnest disagree about that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  No, I, I, I think his experience was vastly more wrenching than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I, I mean I didn’t have to watch people hang at 12 o’clock in the morning and stay there and then maybe be called as to be shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Do you, do you ever have dreams or nightmares about the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Actually, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  That’s good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Do, do most people that you speak, I have never asked this question, or have been asked this question so I don’t know what other people answer.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  There’s, as a matter of fact, some not in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> but in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and some in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and, but we get together and we talk on the telephone all the time and we know of each other and we support each other and when, and there were reunions. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We went to a reunion, I think it was °88, I’m not mistaken, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshombon</span> (ph) and there’s going to be one this year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshombon</span> (ph) for the sad reason to bury Maktotottmay (ph) and so we see each other very frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  And that time seems like it left a profound and lasting impression and impact on your life, that time 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshombon</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Why do you think that is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  Because it’s, it’s a most unusual story. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The, that a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , in fact I think it’s the only time an entire <span class="REGION">region</span> , an entire <span class="REGION">region</span> decided not to cooperate with the power in, of the government, to oppose the government in, in such a threatening situation to them, their own lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  You had said...
ANSWER:  Not such a single person. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That happened very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Not just a single family or two or three devoted citizens but an entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  You told me at lunch that you consider yourself a pacifist. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">What, what do you think that’s, what do you think that’s an outgrowth of? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Where did that, I mean, was that from your family or from the Quakers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  It, it must be a combination but I just hate to see people be committed to a situation which they cannot control, it’s beyond their control. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And in war, you give up the control of your destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  You had also said that your pacifism sometimes comes into conflict with, with wars that might be just.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yes, I’m, I have learned that I have to admit that there are times when you have to give up your individual freedom for the, for the good of a principle which is the freedom of somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  I don’t know whether I have any other questions for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Is there anything else you’d wanted to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Guess one of the things that I had asked you, in the questions Id given you earlier was about the, whether you thought the experiences that you and Earnest had been through ever caused any difficulties in your relationship at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="634">It’s a tough question to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Could you be more precise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Well, that, that you had both been through such harrowing times that, whether you thought 1t meant that it was hard to get through to him or it affected your communication or that one of you didn’t want to talk about something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  No I would related it to the past experience if we, like all people who live together for 50 years have differences of opinion, then it is more due to the change of the culture in which you live in that has occurred over those 50 years and I’m particularly referring to the change of women’s rights for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I am for complete legality, always was, even before it was fashionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  The legality of women and men, meant something to me ever since I can remember but at that time, it was sort of unusual and, and it wasn’t an issue in, 1n our relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">However, I, now that women not only demand equal treatment but also demand, not only equal treatment before the law, but ask for equal treatment in any situation, this might constitute sometimes a point of difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  I guess my earlier question was, was sort of based on the, the phenomenon where men who’ve gone through experiences of war are, don’t like to talk about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They sort of keep it very hidden and reserved and I just wondered whether that Earnest had had that with his experience and that, it result...
ANSWER:  What kind of, are you thinking of something in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  Oh his, well his experience at, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and, and not wanting to talk about that and whether that made you feel somehow like you didn’t understand a part of him, or didn’t know a part of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I just wondered whether there had been any of that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Yes, I mentioned it before, that he was reluctant to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I was reluctant to ask and I never knew whether he wanted me to ask first. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And that was the difficulty, we, we really didn’t talk about that until he, he, he seemed to become a little more comfortable with the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  And why did it change? </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Why did he become more comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  I think time, time, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And then his wish to talk about it became stronger and then my, also my family encouraged him to talk about it when we visited them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="652">end of side one, tape 2]
QUESTION:  Did that bring you closer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  We were very close to begin with so I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I don’t think you, you could say that because we were very close at the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Was it a positive experience that, that he began to talk and...
ANSWER:  Oh yes, I was very glad that he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Very glad. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Yes, it gave me a great deal of insight and well like, you might find out, you might find that asking people the things that you ask gives you an insight that you didn’t have before and adds to your knowledge of this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It surely does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  And did you discover whether it was the reason he didn’t say anything, was it because he was waiting for you to ask or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  No, I don’t, no, I think now he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  I don’t have any other questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">If there’s more that you want to say, that...
ANSWER:  I would have to think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  Do you want to look over your notes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  If not, that’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Well, we were talking about, that you talk, you speak about the Holocaust a lot these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Can you, can you tell me what, what it is that you do and, and how often you, you talk about your experiences? </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And you, we, we talked about before we started recording that, for a long time you didn’t talk, you didn’t discuss it much, you didn’t talk to other people and talk publicly and now, and now you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Why, why is there that change? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Why 1s that change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Well we have, ever since I’m working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a lot of material and also my husband has started to write his memoirs and that 1s probably the, the main reason, because after writing his memoirs he asks me to read them and to give my opinion and that’s how we start about. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">His memoirs by the way, are not just on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his very happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But of course, in the middle of these happy stories, is his experience of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he is extremely interested anything that relates to the Holocaust and its origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And so we, we come very interested in the entire question of why the question of anti-Semitism and the history of anti-Semitism and in particularly the history of anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And that’s a very vast subject if you really want to get knowledgeable about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The, it also refers you to things that have not disappeared and are, are, are reappearing in our days now. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We have a very strong nationalistic party in every one of these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , especially in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , which is frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Do, do you feel as though it’s sort of a duty of yours, to, to speak more openly about the Holocaust and help other people understand it? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I mean is there, do you feel as though now you have more of a, kind of a mission, or that there’s more of a need?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Yes, because we are dying out. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The people who can testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There are very few left and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not come up before, which might be helpful in writing this history. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">As an example, I just learned two days ago about a happening that might be interesting to mention in this connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">In, there was the, the big question in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was why the was the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshombon</span> (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don’t think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and put into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in order that he be transported into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or we didn’t know where of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he was all of a sudden released. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And of course he jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and disappeared but the, we all had theories on why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12 years at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn’t at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was because the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had written to Pitton (ph) saying that the children, the Jewish children of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshombon</span> (ph) have, are under the protection of the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Sicroa (ph) Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And therefore cannot be touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">He had never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">This note, this letter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I expect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former Soviet Union, the archives from all over the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> where the German Gestapo was the government, are coming up now. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And they had been hidden before.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Oh, I wouldn’t know exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  What did you tell her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  Everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But, I don’t recall exactly when it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">She knew from her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , that’s a different story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  We, you had said earlier that people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> thought of themselves as survivors and that anyone else who didn’t, were not survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  Not at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Extermination camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"> Extermination camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">How does that make you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Do you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I mean obviously you understand that sentiment but...

ANSWER:  I don’t know that I care what other people think about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">It doesn’t change me, what they think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Do you think there’s a danger in seeing, viewing, that some people do view survivors as just survivors? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Not necessarily you but, that...
ANSWER:  A lot of people do, I’m used to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Well, I think ’ve exhausted my questions again. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Thank you very much.</span></p>
