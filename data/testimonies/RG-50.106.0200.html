<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  He was totally secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">However, his mother was quite religious and his father, I remember him saying or at least my grandmother who lived with us that he studied Torah in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> and I guess they had some kind of <span class="BUILDING">store</span> And my mother’s family was also secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">That was the Sudetenland where she grew up and her father was as she said a notar, which was notary which is very unusual for a Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And they were secular too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What kind of education did they have? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">https://collections.ushmm.org August 22, 2012
ANSWER:  Well <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I’m not quite sure if there was something after. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She probably went to some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and after. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And my father probably went, I’m saying probably, <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I think he wanted to be a lawyer, but that all changed when his father died of the swine flu. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I think it was 1918 Is that right, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  He had to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and you know support his mother and himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  How did your parents meet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I think they met at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karly Vary</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsbad</span> in German and it was a place where people went to summer and as a matter of fact I found the actual <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> where they met and first danced with each other and as my mother said. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean he was quite short and quite fat but my mother said he could dance a mean tango. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So and he was very kind of Prussian. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was not known for his charm, although he could be very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And my mother was very beautiful and very charming and after they met they were both invited to a dinner party where the subject of Hitler came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the Czechs in the Sudetenland were saying oh it’s nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Don’t worry and my father who got, he had a big, bad temper. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He got outraged and he called them all chicken headed. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And but no one believed him and so he stormed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But the next day he was at my mother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">She was probably working in some kind of <span class="BUILDING">dress shop boutique</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , with a dozen long stemmed roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I think you know she later said that why she married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She had many suitors was because she felt like he was rock solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That she could rely on him and indeed his paranoia saved her and her own parents wouldn’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Her father said since he didn’t speak English, what would I do, sell sausages in a <span class="REGION">foreign land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So his, and her brother, my uncle Paul Brennan, is the story stayed behind to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And that’s how they met. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">https://collections.ushmm.org August 22, 2012

<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  My father. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And pretty soon after they met, I think he took my mother and his mother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they made their getaway the minute the Germans crossed over into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , maybe a little before that.</span></p>
