<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  So you actually have a lot memories of <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Oh, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I had my own monkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I had my own parrot, white with a little tuft. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And that parrot was talking, and the monkey was always hugging me, loving me to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I miss that, because here you’re not allowed to have a monkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But it is companionship, and you feel kind of- you know, you have something that belongs, and that you protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Cause the natives, of course, they protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They only had interest in themselves, to stay safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We played tennis, and we -- we swam a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember you -- you went in your pajamas to the movies, that that’s the custom, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Nobody’s looking around like she’s crazy, it is just the way that -- that you lived, that way.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  In the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Oh yeah, but see that was not changed that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was the last time in 84, and everything was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And that’s why after that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no inclinations to go back, because it is so changed, I don’t re-remember that is my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It’s all <span class="DLF">highway</span> , modern <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are ap -- you know here the -- the <span class="DLF">Beltway</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> 1s it much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Because you have not been prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="85"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is as -- as small as <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everything has to be one way, because the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are so narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In those days -- the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were built in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-more built. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So if you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , the <span class="DLF">streets</span> you can only walk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> would not even move, because it is so shuclocked, you couldn’t make a turn, it was blocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Y-You don’t even need a traffic sign, because it’s not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So where do people leave their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, you have <span class="INT_SPACE">parking space</span> , if you can find one, but it could be two blocks away -- as long as you have your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> parked. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And that is why we didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was always on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , cause that’s the easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And you -- you kept your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because they were stealing like heck. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Now we had the Germans, for instance, we -- we were, for instance, on one end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , blocked by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , two or three, full of soldiers, and on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> the same way, so you could not get out, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And then they were doing rusias. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">A rusia means that this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house search, for either a radio, a fur coat, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , anything that they could use. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And if you would listen to the BBC for news, then you would get down on your knees in front of your <span class="DLF">front door</span> , ping, out.</span></p>

So you -- y-you were accumulating really, evidence that something was going wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all over, already, in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB organization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you are in the military, and you take the oath of defending your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you just don’t take that, you fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We sabotaged plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So when it was the time for the Germans to go in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , they pretended that it was necessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And we just broke the <span class="DLF">dikes</span> , so the water was -- was all over the bolus. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You know, the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> is much lower on the sea level than this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s, So we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that you cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But the point was that the German heavy equipment could not go through, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So the Germans were forced to go over in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It was wall to wall <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">In -- in German is -- it’s falsesharem. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Parachutes, parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So, 1t was a nice target to -- to -- from the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I always felt sorry, because those people were their own age, like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And why would you kill an -- a young boy that is forced to do something he doesn’t want to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Because, I talked with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We -- we had the -- you know, that we were on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had lots of hair, all black hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don’t dare. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I sneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And then he would go, “Oh, what are you doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="295">In German, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I said, “Don’t worry, I’m just -- you know, I’m having a bet, and I won.” </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Now you can see what a crazy kid I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don’t fear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don’t do it, what we are supposed to do, we get killed in our -- our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So I found out a lot from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Besides, I had a girlfriend -- that was after the war, who had a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and she said, “When I was on my own <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , because there was something fa -- fishy 1n that <span class="REGION">area</span> .”” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Where the smell came from? </span><span class="sentence" id="302"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So they had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> all over, and the German population was not supposed to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I cannot say that, because in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have Democrats, also divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It’s incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So it is in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But you had to be careful, because how did you know?</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="321">See? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So -- and we had no intentions. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a coward if I would have tried to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the gays, like -- what do you call those people?

<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Well, he is two years younger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  And you didn’t ask a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You eventually saw him, but -- but that’s just how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Because he had, of course, only the news what he -- we gave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But since my father was listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just -- you just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I mean, I was a student nurse, in a way, but in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> were plenty people also in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Now, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They need fresh air, so they were in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So that <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, “Hide me, hide me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="417">A Dutch person. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I says, “Go on, go on in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , don’t move.” </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Then the German comes right behind him. “</span><span class="sentence" id="420">Did you see anyone?” </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Again, I stood like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I said, “Do you want to get TBC? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I didn’t see anyone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Go eyeball to eyeball. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">In German. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So he understood what he had to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So he -- he looked with respect all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">But I had no intention to let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My intention was put my foot out, and then he would stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">That was my intention. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So we were pretare -- prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So then he -- he ran to the other end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , because he couldn’t get any -- and this guy said, “Is it okay?” </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I said, “Keep mouth shut, I will tell you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and we put him in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , if he could be trusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But I thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with other people, then th-the -- the principal should be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  I was not in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I was a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I was a tomboy girl, and people say, “Oh boy, you have to be careful with her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Because I could climb on -- on the -- on the rainpipe to reach the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I beat the -- the boys of my age to pulp. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They had to respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I was a real nasty, because you get that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">If a boy is telling you you cannot do this, you cannot do that, I proved to them I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That was the funny thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And still, my next door neighbors are what you call skinheads. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Th-the -- the boys in the 20’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Now”
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, they live right behind -- beside me. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So they were using my <span class="DLF">yard</span> like so what, you know, it’s j-just an old woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So they play baseball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the balls and didn’t return it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And then they would yell bloody murder, like saying words I better not repeat -- repeat in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And one day I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all -- all kinds of things in my life, all kinds of courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip, very tight, couldn’t shake me off, and mur -- you see my nails? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">That is really like a cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So five nails on this side of his back, five nails on this side of his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He had no shirt on. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The blood was coming out. “</span><span class="sentence" id="461">Ow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You should have heard him. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He could not sleep for five days on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And that was the time they didn’t play ball either. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They still are not looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They are not looking at me, they are scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Now they are now 25, in the meantime, and whatever age, but no, y-you got to show respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">In -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , also, I was followed by a guy in the <span class="DLF">dunes</span> once, and I knew there was something in his eyes that I did not like. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So, I went around that <span class="DLF">shelter</span> , and I ran, ran, ran, and I outran him. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I have third -- third class medal in racing with eight other <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I have that someplace, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I -- I was good 1n -- in -- in track and <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I was team leader in my hockey team, and they were also all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But see, you don’t talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">In those days, you played hockey. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And if a guy would ask you for a date, I would not accept, just to be on the safe side. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I did date, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I mean, I was not that -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But it was amazing that the guys I liked were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They -- they went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenee</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and they never reached <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I found that out, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But, you know, that -- that is the way things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I mean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev- several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance, that is a kind of a small type of missile, two <span class="DLF">streets</span> from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Now, you can imagine that you have that here. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Some failed, went back where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">One shell landed in the roof of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , right through my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and I was hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , because I was told the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> will put -- be your protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So I crawl out, and there it is, big shell, right through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So we could not repair that at the time, because there was nobody to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The rain was just pouring through. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Oh, and then the day that -- that we had the invasion, I was on vacation, and five o’clock in the morning - I never forget that either -- a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> goes really diving in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , not even the tops of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , but half of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , over the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and -- and -- and -- and bombing the -- the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that were on the end of that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Now, they had horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">We all came out in pajamas and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I saw horses heads, legs, tail. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Soldiers without a head were still walking, in a daze, of course, and then they dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I-It was so terrible to look at it, I can never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So that was five o’clock in the morning, and that was a holiday, like we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">In -- in -- in -- in Europe, you called it Poppy day. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We all walk

<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  That was the -- the actually visual experience, because in that time, I had my vacation for maybe four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And you are not that stupid to go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and go back again, because the Germans took -- took care of that immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">There was no chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But you listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">You listened to neighbors, you listened to -- to the people that you are -- excuse me -- that you are playing hockey with. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We had to stop that for awhile, because we were too sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I mean, you are just not in the mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I-It -- it is too -- it’s too -- too -- too emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And of course, we had that -- what do you call that here? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It’s funny, sometimes I -- I forget the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I know exactly it is -- it is like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">A funinis. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">What is that in English? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Isn’t that stupid? </span><span class="sentence" id="528">A <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , where you -- you -- you keep prisoners in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  A <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  A <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So that was close by also. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And you [indecipherable] 1s at that, because that was still in good hands, so called. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But --
QUESTION:  Well, when -- after the bombing, di -- we -- did Germans appear on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Sort of taking charge on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Not -- not -- no, not yet, but it was the NSB, that was the -- the party that was what you call collaborating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So they send signals, or they called, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">This happened, that happened, and the Germans were very pleased, you know, that everything went the way that they hoped it would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But the NSB was not, of course, believing that there was another party to watch them, and so they lost -- they lost casually, their people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And that was because we were very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We didn’t get no for an answer.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Okay, and --
ANSWER:  And then, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Everything was on halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So you used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And that’s why I could not have the Germans to take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I told him that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">That’s -- that’s my -- and of course, you think, well, can’t she just go for two hours without hindrance? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Of course I was hindered, but in those days, a nurse was respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You needed a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I had an old aunt, and she was in -- in ho-house for old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We went to visit her, to bring food. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That is just the way you do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You don’t let your friends die. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You work the hell out of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I worked day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  What was your mom doing at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  My mom was not strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Physically, when she came from <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , she was what you call -- she di -- didn’t have a particular illness, but I think that she was close to diabetes. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She died at 83, and my father died when he was 94, but I have my father’s system. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And so I don’t fear -- I mean, I don’t fear if I die, period, because that is a normal way, to accept the way things go, but I always wanted to be sure I don’t die in an accident, or that I don’t die because someone else wants my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I j-just fight, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I’m -- I’m just that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So maybe that is -- that 1s a kind of a vitamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  S-So did meeting some of these boys change your mind at all about the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Make them in a way more human?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I told them from the beginning, if they ask me for a date -- now, you have to understand, you have that uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">If I get caught in that uniform, I know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So please, don’t pretend I’m stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They say, “You are right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But if I was forced, they would not have had me alive, because I am not being forced to do what I don’t want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">See, that boy that we had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was forced. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We had to.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  We had, in 1945, I was assigned to a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> with 50 babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Those babies were underfed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">You don’t ask how, you know it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">So, if they had no tattoo, it could be a Dutch baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">If they had a tattoo, you was aware that was a baby that was taken from a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> , or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">In those days, everything was chaos, unpredictable, you didn’t know if the stories what went around was rumor or truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">But you had to do what the nurse is supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffins</span> any more, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Coffins were out of the question, because there was no wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or paper, and -- and then it was -- if you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Yeah, in my <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> were many, many who -- who died, and was very emotional, but what can you do, you know, you’re not God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  But when you say yo-yo-you don’t ask, but you know, I mean there’s a good chance that a lot of those babies that were being undernourished, were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  That was not the rule, cause everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">If you was fat, I was supposed to be fat, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">That has to do with the type of food, you only had soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Anything what you ate was soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And if you know medical structure of a person’s body, it -- it sets in your- in your skin, it sets in your nerves, it sets in your -- in your fat -- you call it edemish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">You put a- a thumb on someone’s skin, and it would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">So that means that is an impression of a person that has too much fluid in the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And that was the only food you had anyway, so what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I had pea soup, I had this soup, I had that soup, I -- but at least you had soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">You -- you- you went out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and get the leaves from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , cook them, that was soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">People don’t understand that here, because you have so -- everything, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">You have so much choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">When I went in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> after the -- the -- that we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I couldn’t believe my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I said to my husband, “God, we should have had all that stuff during the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Because the shelves were with all of those different brands of -- of food, and cans, and oh, what a choice you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">It was all vitamins, perhaps.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1730">ANSWER:  We had a map with pins, and listening to the BBC, we changed the pins where they lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">So we knew, looking at the pins, that they lost this part, they lost that part, they lost <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they -- they lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">The Russians were killing them in the east of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> were certain battles lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">The battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> , you see the -- you saw maybe in the movies about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">So we -- we didn’t have to notice it, you just looked, or listened, and that is how you got the nerve to do some certain things that you didn’t dare to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">And that is why we knew that wi -- they were, you know, sent to th-the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> , that is [indecipherable], and that was the -- the <span class="REGION">area</span> where the underground had the -- settled, and there they had to leave all their fur coats that they were snatching, and -- and radios, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">All -- all the luxury stuff that was stolen, they had to leave it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And they are -- they were -- I think, but I -- I cannot be sure about it, stripped from all their whatever, paraphernalia, on their arms, because of ranks, and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">So they walked for two or three hours, to their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , as a private. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">You didn’t notice if a colonel, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">We just got them s -- so far down that they were not looking us in the face any more.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1743">ANSWER:  And that is why we also snapped those girls that we knew had dated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">And we put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and that’s all facts, it’s not that I invent that -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , with a razor here, and razed off, fell on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">Other young people of my age threw tomatoes in their faces, rotten eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">We saved it all up for that purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">And then, of course, they were also -- I don’t know, I was not there to -- to witness that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">Cause what happened after that, I don’t know, if they were molested, or -- or raped, or -- I -- I just don’t know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1749">QUESTION:  Oh, you weren’t there when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1750">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">Because, as I told you, I was still a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">I was still in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and what I know 1s either from newspaper news, or in -- in -- 1n the radio at the time, then you had the nerve to listen to your own radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">But see, the radio was still German minded, so it was not the way that you could believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">But when the radio became Dutch again, that was where you listened to, and that was honest.</span></p>

[</span><span class="sentence" id="1768">indecipherable] is that -- is that the Dutch way to do things, with the -- officially it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">Dutch people are not angels, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">They are nasty.</span></p>
