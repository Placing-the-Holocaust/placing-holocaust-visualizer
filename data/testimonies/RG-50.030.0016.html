<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The other thing I was going to mention to you, is that you don’t need to pay attention to the camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">You can just talk to me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Tell me a little bit about life before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">What was your family life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What was—?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  I was one of seven children. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We lived in one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , opposite from <span class="BUILDING">Army barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My father was a tailor, concentrated on making suits, uniforms for the officers and higher ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We lived quite comfortably. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was approximately 1933, '34, until my father got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And my mother also ran a little <span class="BUILDING">candy store</span> up in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My father got sick and eventually he died at age 48. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I don't remember exactly the year, '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I'm sorry, '35 or '36, and life became very, very, very unbearable, very hard for my mother and seven children to take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We had to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because we could not afford to pay the rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So a gentleman by the name of — I think of Grenholc who had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and an a and a wood plant, where they cut wood and sold in round packages for heating, and also a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of making cement blocks for <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And he offered to my mother a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where she would sell coal and wood by the kilo, and we could have our <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I remember we were sleeping in that <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> with the leaking roof, we had to put <span class="INT_SPACE">basins</span> to catch the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was very unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">At that time my mother learned somehow that there is in existence an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> on <span class="DLF">Krochmalna Street</span> , run by Dr. Janusz Korczak'. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And when I speak of Janusz Korcezak, I ' Janusz Korcezak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">In 1912 he was appointed director the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> at <span class="DLF">Krochmalna Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Israel Gutman, ed., </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (New Y ork: Macmillan Publishing, 1990), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="35">Korezak, Janusz.” </span><span class="sentence" id="36">would gladly give half of my life for him, that kind of a man he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Mother tried to get somebody to — made an application, because she never learned how to read and write, none of us could to fill out any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Finally, application was made, and very intensive investigation took place, and I was accepted to this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">However, my mother said I'm the youngest child and she would like to keep me around her as long as she can. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So my brother Icek, which he calls himself Joseph now, if possible he would go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So he was accepted to go in full-term, and I went to visit him, and I never wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I was always crying when I had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So they give me permission to be — they call it “half internat,” internat” was <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , that mean that I could spend the whole day, have my meals, go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Again, every night I cried when I had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And life was so wonderful; they served five meals a day, and Dr. Korezak and all the supervisors and all the counselors made sure that every child eats properly this. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They actually stood over your head and made sure you had your meal, that you feel good, and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for — you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And we were so respected at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , anybody that was from Korczak’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Every month we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> , which actually my brother was entitled to go for two months, but he gave one month to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He went one month, and I went one month. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Children had to be seven years old in the first grade, and they were kept until they were fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When they reach fourteen they received two suits, two pair of shoes, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Out, somebody else took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">When my brother finished his terms, I was accepted and I went in for the last two years, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And my life was just, just, just wonderful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then in 1938, '39 or '40, unfortunately the war broke out and everything became like turmoil, with the bombardments of small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and some children started to come into our <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And Dr. Korczak just could not refuse anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Before there were only 107 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There were 51 boys and 66 girls”.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  I'm going to stop the you there a minute, because I want to ask you some questions about the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  But let's just go back a little bit before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">You had mentioned that there were children beating you up when you were a young boy”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Was this because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Only because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Especially when religious classes took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Jewish children * <span class="BUILDING">Boarding school</span> (Polish). * </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Later in the interviewee states that there were 56 girls in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The latter number would appear to be correct, since 66 and 51 do not add up to 107. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">had to step out into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> for that hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And when the religion class was over, all the boys just walked up and say “You killed Jesus,” and start to beat up on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So since my mother had a <span class="BUILDING">candy store</span> , I used to manage, for that day, to have some candies in pocket and bribe them, or a few pennies. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But that was not the case always, so I always found an excuse to my mother when there was a religious class, I said I don't feel good, or there was a day off when the teacher 1s sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I just didn't want to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I couldn't bear being beaten up all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Now this was way before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Way before the war; way before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Till I got into Dr. Korczak’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Now, also were — I mean you lived in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where there were a lot of gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Did you have any good friends or nice neighbors who were not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  We had neighbors, but I could not have any Polish friends, they were just — I think 1t was the finger is always pointed the at me, “Zyd. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Don't play him with him he 1s a zyd.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And did this change or get worse once the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yes, it got worse when the war began. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">When the war began, for instance when the German walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> they came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and handed out loaves of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So right away a <span class="DLF">line</span> ; and wherever it was a <span class="DLF">line</span> , I stood in the <span class="DLF">line</span> no matter what the reason was, because I knew I was going to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And if the Polish kids they pointed to me and said in German, “This man is a zyd.” </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I had to run before I got beaten up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day the war broke out? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Do you remember what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  The war broke out when we came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I remember one of our neighbors came running to my mother and there was headline in the newspaper.

<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  And what next signs did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  The reaction was exciting because we didn't know about war. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And matter of fact, the feeling of war existed prior to start of the war, like being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ”; we had a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we played in sand, building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , building different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That summer we told everybody not to play, we are going to play war, like we made Polish Army and German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Me and other boy, we had a Polish army, and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was called Froim in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , I was also called Maly° Icek. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Icek is my brother, I'm the small Icek. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So there was the army of Moses and the Army of Ariel and Froim — Ariel was the second general. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we prepared <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And for bullets we would save chestnuts, and when the war broke out, we start throwing chestnuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">When we got hit three times, had to be carried out, so that was the feeling that naturally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> lost, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> won. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So then after the war — when the war started, naturally our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was one of the first to get burned down because they had announced that Solna number eight, where we have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , 1s a point of refreshments for soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">A little bit later a bomb came down; an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> was just cruising about, and they couldn't stop the fire or anything, and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> went down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  We were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we ran out when the fire started. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We ran out and just > children’s summer camp sponsored by <span class="BUILDING">Korezak’s orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">° Small (Polish). </span><span class="sentence" id="122">crying, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We didn't have time to take any bedding or anything because it was full already. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And then we marched off to one of my sister, which was married by then, she lived near the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We walked over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then couple days later, the they marched in the soldiers marched in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking, or were you terrified?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Not terrified; kind of excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Because the notion was that Jewish people and the German were getting along because, basically more or less understood the language, could communicate more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So we believed it wouldn't be too bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  So you didn't have much information in terms of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Not at all, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Not interested, only to satisfy them, our hunger, because when the war broke out, right away everything was — all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There was no food available. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And even in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , you know, it became rations like, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Food was available; Dr. Korczak saw to it that we get food, but — it appeared on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blackboard</span> : Two slices of bread, or three slices of bread; as much as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I will never forget, Dr. Korczak used to stand over us in good times. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I remember good times and I remember bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">In the good times he used to go behind the children and make sure they eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And as a joke, if somebody was holding a piece of bread, he used to pull it out, grab it and put it in his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Now I also remember when it appeared two slices each, also for Dr. Korczak two slices, but he never ate his two slices, he gave to another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Every day he gave his bread to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we stupid children, we took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We never realize that the man grows thinner and thinner and thinner; that kind of man he was.</span></p>
