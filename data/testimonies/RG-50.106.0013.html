<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And--oh, so--what did I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Signed up--this was all done by mail because then in <span class="REGION">Arkansas</span> , now, it's all going through--I really don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I--I did sign up and received a commission through the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The funniest thing was I didn't know I had a commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This is all just very strange to me, and I thought I'd got it when I--I thought I would get it when I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> for basic training, but actually I had it the minute that I received the assignment, and it was strange ‘cause I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --we all had to stand up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were so full and there was a chaplain and a--and an enlisted man and I sharing one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The chaplain got it when he got on. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He was very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he said we'll all--it was about eight hours from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He said, "We'll share this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> " so we -- we actually —have to stand until it's our turn to sit in that one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and --so as we were talking, they told me --this chaplain and this enlisted man had been in for awhile said, "You're already a second lieutenant." </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I thought that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Anyhow --and they thought I was pretty naive so went on down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> and took basic training there, and I can't remember how much later but not long after that had orders for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Swift</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , with the 121st Semi-Mobile Evacuation Hospital was --I can't remember the word for that— activating. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Was activating. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So the doctors and nurses and corpsmen from --and administrative people from around the <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> and--I think it's probably primarily up here in the --in the East were gathering at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> to activate this <span class="BUILDING">tent hospital</span> , and from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">After we were activated as a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , all of us were there, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Everything's by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in those days, and stayed there a few days, and then at night --well, no, there had to be as much secrecy as possible then because we were going by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and they still had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-boats</span> , the Germans had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-boats</span> in the Atlantic, so went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we had no idea where we were going, but I remember going onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the blackout, complete blackout, and you --suddenly you were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It's almost as if you didn't really know you were boarding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ; but there we were, and I think we left, maybe sailed the next morning and took us five days to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and -- and that --I believe we were waiting for the --when was D-Day? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Do you remember what day that was? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I think we were waiting for --no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We were waiting for some real heavy activity to loosen up a little so that we could cross the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Stayed there a few days and then we started -- and then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> I know one time another nurse and I and a doctor and a couple of corpsmen were sent to somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">At that time everything was "somewhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">No <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> could be listed or anything so this was somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which from --and that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg</span> is a very, very short distance, and we went in one little old --one little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army ambulance</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Of course it had been a blackout, and that was quite a trip because the --1n a complete blackout, and they had --I guess--I don't know how they ran that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> but must have been very dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not much 'cause anyway they came to a --a huge crater, bomb crater in the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and the driver had to stop just short of that because he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but he knew there was something there, and he got out--and he flashed --you had to flash your flashlights down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Never up or out but down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and I remember him flashing that around to see how big the crater was so he could go around it; and down in a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> by the <span class="DLF">road</span> we heard these flashes of lights and heard some kind of firing, some kind of skirmishing down there, and we finally reached our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Then the next morning we were really balled out for having come because it was so dangerous, but our commanding officer hadn't known that. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Somehow the communications hadn't been so good so we got to this --where we were detached to this very small outfit, and they needed --they just needed help so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That's why we were detached there, and they had a lot of German wounded too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Now, was this your first nursing activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">No, we helped in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Should back up to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> we --we worked 1n a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there for a little while, and I can't remember how long, and those-those were --we had American casualties from a big, big battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That may have been --I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Anyhow it was very heavy fighting, big battle, very important fighting at that time, and we had many American casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That's why we had to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> awhile to take care of them and wait for things to calm down a little bit in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so that--that was it until we rejoined our own <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> from this little--whatever that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was not an <span class="BUILDING">evac hospital</span> , smaller than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  So in this little, little hospital--
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  --there were a lot of German wounded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  And a lot of American wounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  A lot of American.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And--
QUESTION:  How was this for you as a very young, inexperienced nurse to see all these war casualties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  I think we lived from day-to-day. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I -- I -- I know at that time I had no thought of the war ever ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Perhaps some people did, I don't know, but I think for the most part all of us were living just by the day because we didn't know if we'd be moving out the next day or what would happen because we didn't --we kept our patients --we were not supposed to keep them over 24 hours and then they were sent back to the rear, so I think we lived essentially --everything was so fast, and perhaps we were moving so fast, everything happened so fast that we didn't really think about tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Now, I'm sure that people who were moving our little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for us had to plan all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know, the logistics had to be tremendous, but the rest --the nurses and doctors and corpsmen just lived for that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So then you were moved to--
ANSWER:  We would follow where the fighting was, and that would be --well, we were advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was no retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">This was toward the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">19--early part of 1944 so you see it was --no. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The end of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So it was --the war was winding down-it was still very heavy fighting, but we were advancing constantly, and we were --so we had to move frequently, very frequently, and it was --I don't know how many times we moved, but it was --we'd always set up our <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> in a <span class="DLF">field</span> unless there might be a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> handy that --that we could set up in which would be a --a real help for a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because I remember, you know, a dog could wander through the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , and that's just the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Set up in muddy ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">No flooring, of course, for the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Just mud or dry --just dirt, whatever it happened to be at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  And were you an <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> nurse or--
ANSWER:  No, no, I was just --no, I had just gotten out of --out of <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">No, I was a-- general duty they called it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Just --and as that you're put anywhere where you're needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">No specialty. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So from there--at some point we were near--there --well, we were attached--by this time we were attached to the Third Army, to Patton's Third Army, and we were somewhere near where Patton was, and I don't really know where that was, and it couldn't have been very far from the--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Now, you were attached to --
ANSWER:  Patton's Third Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  --Patton's Third Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And your unit was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">121st Evacuation Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">A very small <span class="BUILDING">tent hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  So we were in --in --near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and Patton had been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And Patton was a very tough old soldier, and he wanted everyone to visit in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , within that <span class="REGION">area</span> to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> to see what was there so they'd be --it would--become so furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The war's still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Become so furious that--that it would make certainly better fighting men, determined, and I know our commanding officer thought it would not be the place for the women to --I think there were 30 or 33 of us women, very few of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He did not want us to go there, but Patton said everyone would go, no exceptions, and so all of us had to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  So that meant you didn't do your nursing medical care during the time that you were going to--
ANSWER:  It was just one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  No, we didn't but that would have meant that other --we --I don't remember all that-- we would have had to have gone in shifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Right, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  And I think I must have been on the first shift because I know we were told that--that the --the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been liberated three days before we got there, so not very much --all they had --had been able to do was hand out food to --to the --to those who were surviving, and there were quite a few who were surviving, and they handed out food. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Nothing had been done as far as I can think because the bodies were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227"><span class="INT_SPACE">Gas chamber</span> , everything was as it had been and —and I'm having flashbacks so --we went there on one --kind of a dismal day. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Had to have been in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Had no idea really --I mean you --you know, you've heard that this is going on, but --but you haven't known anyone who's seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You haven't seen the pictures because it's just been liberated, just now getting people in and getting the pictures, and so when we arrived there, I can't remember that we even spoke to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">There were very few of us, so we had to have gone in shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Very few of us, and I can't remember even speaking to anybody because it was such a shock; but nobody broke down and wept or had hysterics, and I don't know if part of that was the training you've had as a medical group or not, but I just remember silence, and the shock is incredible and you --perhaps walk through in a bit of a daze because who can --who can assimilate to all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we were shown through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I don't remember by whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Probably -- probably some of the soldiers who had liberated them, I'm not sure, but we were shown through the camp around the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , and the inmates who were there were still dressed in their striped uniforms and so happy, so filled with joy and trying so hard to do anything they could for us, and I think --I could be wrong here but I think it was both American and British who liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , but I'm not certain, but all I saw were American soldiers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we went through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and you want me to describe the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  They were wooden <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , not very large at all, and they had --these were just for sleeping, and they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , as I remember it, four high with just a few inches between each two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> so that you --you just knew --there was just no way a --a person could turn over in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">For them to change their position to turn over, I'm sure they had to slide out and start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Just a --just probably the head cleared. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I think that was about all to get four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> high. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And that just seemed terrible to us, you know, with no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or things like that, none of the comforts. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And there was one --we went through one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and there were two men there still in their striped uniforms, and they were --you've heard the expression "skin and bones." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Well, in this case for these inmates, that was literal. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Absolutely literal. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And they had been given some black bread by the Americans I'm sure, and they wanted to share it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Now, had we been older, more mature, we would have accepted as their guests because who had they been able to share with or had anything to share with? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Or even talked with freely, but we thought how can we take their bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That's all they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And we refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Later I thought had I been older, more mature, I would have handled it differently, but we did refuse that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Then we were shown the --at some point the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> --crematoria --I guess--is 1t <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> or <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Either one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  With the bodies and, you know, ready to be cremated. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We were shown the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and the stacks of bodies, naked bodies so high and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> filled with them in addition to the stacks on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Then we were taken to one of the Nazi administrator's offices, probably a commanding office, I'm not sure, and they pointed out this lamp shade made out of human skin, and it was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I'm about to cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Do you want to stop for a minute? [</span><span class="sentence" id="260">Interview interrupted; tape recorder turned off] End of File One Beginning of File Two
QUESTION:  Tape 1, Side 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So you said that you saw other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We --the war was over in the --maybe May 8th, I think, something like but we didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> right then, and we --we went --but our --we had no more American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Of course the fighting was over so being the kind of <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we were, we didn't keep patients, therefore, we were just waiting until we got orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">In fact, we had orders to go to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We never went because the war was over there too, was winding down, was over there shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So we went to --can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I think somewhere -- we were the first <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , so I think--or somewhere along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , and we one day went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , a smaller one, and I don't know the name of this one or where it was, but I do remember it was a cold and rainy day, and we went to the --for some reason we went to the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">At the time we went there, I believe there were three of us nurses and the chief nurse, she went there for some reason, we went along with her, and we happened to be at the time that they were -- that the Americans had this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they were issuing clothing to the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There again they had their striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I suppose because they were issuing--we were issuing -- the Americans were issuing clothing, there came the men sort of in a column coming in to get their clothing, and they were stark naked, not a stitch on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They came in where we --three or four women were, and they smiled, and they acted as if they were clothed, + clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we had to look at them as if they were clothed, smile at them and, of course, we didn't speak German, they didn't speak English but, you know, the --probably some handling which--you know, all that -- as if nothing had happened, and we were told that these were political prisoners; that some of the best minds in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were probably there, but they were not politically correct, and yet what grabbed my attention was that these men didn't seem to be aware --of course they were aware they didn't have clothes on, but they didn't seem somehow to acknowledge that. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Some of the big brains in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We only spent a short time there, but that never left me, that impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Were you there to do nursing or--
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  --somebody thought that you should see it or...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Yes, I really can't remember that but a lot of this thing-- this kind of thing, I think you probably try to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I know we were --there were about three of us nurses there with --probably all lieutenants or something, younger nurses there with our chief nurse, and she was just a captain 'cause we had such a small outfit, and she was probably on some administrative mission, I don't know, but we didn't --we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We were just there with her, and --but that's what impressed me to think that these minds had regressed to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  So something had really been done to them to almost dehumanize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And there again skin and bones was the literal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I mean they were -- the --the skin was just absolutely against their bones, and their eyes were--I would say expressionless, and yet they --they --they were glad to be alive because they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That probably doesn't make a lot of sense, but you --you knew they were glad to be alive and they were free and that--that they'd been through horrors that--that they couldn't even describe I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That was the second camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And the third one was probably the worst, and that was somewhere near --it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> near --oh, gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I could look it up, but it's probably not important.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  All right. [</span><span class="sentence" id="293">Tape recorder turned off]
QUESTION:  You were looking up --you were looking up the name of the third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or where the third camp was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I don't know the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was a --1t was in an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Luftwaffe camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">In fact, some of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were still on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  You said it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Yeah, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And that-- in that one, the women did not--did not do any work, didn't --because they were afraid the women would be attacked by the inmates, but our men --the men from our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> went in and cleaned up this <span class="NPIP">place</span> because it had just been liberated too, so we were stationed there for some time while --while the men in our unit cleaned it up, took care of --set up the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , took care of the sick, and the women were--we were separated, I think, just by a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , just by a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , 'cause I remember a tall <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Of course the <span class="DLF">fence</span> had been built by the Germans to keep the inmates in but also kept us separated from them, and we were there a few weeks probably, and there were so many children and so many of these were French. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Probably most of them were French, but there were children of all ages there, and I remember we would--maybe a couple of us nurses would go for a little walk around the compound and, of course, we couldn't go far but just go around the compound, and these children would line up around the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They weren't allowed out, and they too were absolutely skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">No --no flesh, no muscle that you could see, just --just skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They'd line up at the <span class="DLF">fence</span> looking at us, and we might have a bit of chocolate or something with us, and you'd want to give it to them, or fruit, whatever, so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Anything you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But we were told --we were threatened, I suppose, can't give them anything because it would have killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They were just on liquids for several days, then they would graduate to a soft diet, then regular food. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And one night when we were there, it was very --very striking, very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Some of our big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo planes</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American cargo planes</span> came--now the war is over -- came in to take these --the French people back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and they were so thrilled, so excited about going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that they took everything that was made of wood from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , put it in a huge, huge pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I don't know how many feet high. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Just as high as they could stack it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Set it afire after dark and sang "The Marseille." </span><span class="sentence" id="314">That was impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Very, very wonderful time for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And after that there --there was --we just waited to get orders to come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There were no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but we stayed in that one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until we left to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  And now what was your assignment in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  We had no assignment because we weren't allowed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  Until--
QUESTION:  Until they finished?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Until they finished and got the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> cleaned up and got the patients into some sort of shape that they could leave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The patients I say, the inmates, and then we came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  How was it for you to come back from that to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  You know, then at that time you weren't expected to have any emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -the people --the hospital personnel was not expected to have any emotion because you had to do all you could to help those who --who had --who were traumatized, and I don't think any of us were ever considered to be traumatized. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I guess you weren't allowed to be, and there was --and I can't even remember discussing this with any of--any of the other nurses or doctors or corpsmen who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was just --you saw it and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  And after you came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you didn't talk about it either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Hum-um. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Nobody talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You might --you might say a little bit now and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I know to my --you know, after I had my children, they got older, I did tell them, and once in awhile now I'll tell somebody a little bit about it, but it was something that wasn't discussed, and now I think it's entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They encourage discussion and --and it is therapeutic, but then no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  So you told your children a little bit about it, but you never--
ANSWER:  I probably told them a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I probably told them a lot when they got older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Because you thought it was important for them to know that--
ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  --you--
ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I wanted them to know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Why did you want them to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Because my generation is the last generation that had the --the firsthand contact, firsthand knowledge, and I know that there are people who believe it never happened, and I think there will be more who will refuse to believe it ever happened, and I think it's wonderful what the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> --the records they are keeping of this because I think it must be, must be kept for history, for the future generations, and I think it's great you're getting the interviews now because it--my --well, I say my generation 1s the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Of course the children of the inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> will have some memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That's the next generation, but probably there are not too many of them and so I think it's very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  So what was it like for you after you came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Did you stay in the Army for awhile, or were you discharged?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  I stayed in the Army for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Not very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Well, maybe a couple of years, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And then I got married and got out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  So you got out because you got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Um-hum. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  How was it being in the Army those two years when you came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  It was --well, I was --actually we had mostly men from--not men and women, but men from the-- from the--Europe, from the war --well, from the --from the Pacific too. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">These were the patients we had so it's still family and--because you were sort of family with the patients of those who had been through the same thing that you had and had seen what you had seen, so it wasn't --I don't know, it was just a continuation somehow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  And in that circumstance, people didn't talk much about what they'd been through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The men who had been --those who may have been --may have been through <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , terribly wounded, severely +
QUESTION:  Do you remember whether you thought about --about it, what you had been through and the condition that some of them were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We just didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And I don't know why, but the --the men --saw a lot of those patients, saw a lot of them, and now they're --now we're in a stationary general hospital where you keep your patients so you get to know these patients and you're with them for weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  And you go through a lot with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Go through a lot with them 'cause they were terribly wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where I was, one of them was in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It was plastic surgery, and these were mostly burned patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Terribly burned with much rehabilitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">In fact, we were in --we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasadena</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">McCornack General Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasadena</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , which --and at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasadena</span> was populated by mostly retired, very wealthy people, and they did not want our patients in their <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , on their <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They didn't want them out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because they were --they didn't want to see them because they were too --too badly wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Too disfigured, terribly disfigured. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So much --so many had burned faces, and --and they were re-making their faces, reconstructing, and they didn't want them in their <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now, on one hand, it would be hard to go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and sit --sit next to these patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">On the other hand, these people had defended them, and we were very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The nurses and doctors were very angry about it, and we'd go out with them because the --the men were too embarrassed to go out with anyone but hospital personnel, so the nurses would go out with them and --and maybe to-to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> where they had dancing after and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And at that time I could not understand how anybody could treat them so cruelly but now I see, maybe they did have a little bit of a point because it would be very hard for them to face, for the civilians to face if they hadn't been exposed to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  But it was tough for you at the time to see that happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Hurt very, very much 'cause these --these men were our --our --1n addition to being our patients, they were good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Very good friends, and yes, it hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  So you were at the <span class="BUILDING">Army hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasadena</span> , and where else did you serve?</span></p>

ANSWER:  In x-ray.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Oh, so he was assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  He was in x-ray. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Then got out of the Army, and I didn't --didn't do any more nursing. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I guess I just did another year when the Korean War broke out in 1950, and we were in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a year treating Korean War casualties.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">For about two years I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Yes, I think that was two years it was, and the Korean War broke out, and we went to <span class="BUILDING">Percy Jones Hospital</span> in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , and they were desperate for civilian nurses, any kind of --you know, Army nurses, civilian nurses, whatever they could get, and they got all the civilian nurses they could get in addition to the Army nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  So did your husband also work in the <span class="BUILDING">Army hospital--</span> 
ANSWER:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  --when you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Um-hum. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He was a master sergeant in --maybe not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He was a master sergeant in x-ray, and he was in charge of the --I guess the master serge --the enlisted men in charge of x-radiology. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I'm missing that somehow, but anyhow he was --he was always in radiology.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  That's how we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> areA: Been here for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Was he <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He didn't go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  So he didn't have the war experience that you had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  No, he didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk with him about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Very --no, I didn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I guess maybe not at all perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Do you keep in touch with any of the people that you were overseas with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  Yes, I did --not now. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I did, oh, for years, I did with two. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Two special people. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Actually three. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Three. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And then, you know, our --our paths have diverged and, oh, one of them is dead, and I did keep in contact with her until she died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  So even though you didn't talk about it, you were in contact with people--
ANSWER:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  --who had been through what you had been through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We never mentioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And--and I --now I find that strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I never felt it strange, but now I do find that really strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We never mentioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So I don't know where any of them are now, and --and I'm sure some --I know this one is dead, perhaps some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Because I was actually next to the youngest in the group of nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Therefore, if I'm 75, they would be older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  So do you think much or some or at all about those experiences overseas now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I suppose everyone does quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You know, you don't really get hung up on it, but you'll have these flashbacks and --or something will remind you of what happened then and --yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So I guess I do think about it quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Do you think that 1t changed you in any way to have gone through all that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  You know, I never thought so. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I never thought so, and yet my son one day said to me, he said, "You know, Mom"--he knew someone at work, some woman, and she said her mother had similar experiences, and she thought "I think it's affected my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I don't know how, and he said, "And I said to her, you know, it probably did my mother too." </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I didn't ask him how. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Just --I stay off that subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So I don't think it --I never thought it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Maybe it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Well, it's hard to know what it would have been like if you hadn't have done that 'cause--
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">May have been the very same. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Who knows but it was an experience that you could well do without. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I had a woman one time tell me that she didn't think it ever happened, and I don't know why she said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We weren't talking about it, but she said that she didn't believe that there were ever any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">She thought that was a lot of propaganda, and I--I'm thinking you're talking to the wrong person, and she talked quite a bit about it until I finally just stopped her and told her whatever --I don't remember what I told her, but anyhow I told her the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That shocked me as much as anything probably to think that somebody --she was older than I, so she had been through --in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">She had known what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I mean she had heard --she had to have heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">No way she could have avoided newspapers, radios, what was going on, and yet she thought that was all propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  How did she take it when you told her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Well, I felt that she didn't believe a word of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Then not long ago, I met a woman and she was — and I don't --I don't know why the subject came up, but she was telling me that her father-in-law --I don't know, someone, someone in her family did not believe it ever happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Was propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So again someone else didn't believe it, and then I --that makes me believe there might be a lot of people that believe this never happened, therefore, the story has to be told, has to be kept because I can't imagine there'd be anyone who would think it hadn't happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I know they're teaching it in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> today, and there --they --I think they're teaching it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are those who don't believe, and I can't --apparently they don't want to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Why don't they want to believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Hard to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Um-hum. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Have you heard that there are people who don't believe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  And why do they not believe it, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Hard to --it's hard to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  So do you think if these people--those people who do not believe would go through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , they'd still not believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  I don't know whether they would or not, but I think your testimony's a very important piece of documenting that it did happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There are lots of us out here I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Lots of books are being written now too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Yes, there are. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Is there anything else that you would like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  I don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Anything that I've forgotten to ask you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  I --I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">No, I don't believe that--would have nothing do with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> so I don't think there is anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  Well, that's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">If there's something else that you want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Doesn't have to be directly connected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  It would just be experiences that--that would have no bearing on it so I think it's probably unimportant as far as this goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Experiences in the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Um-hum. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Would have no bearing on --on --on the --well, it would have had some bearing on the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Do you want something--
QUESTION:  If you want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  --or just want to hang around? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Oh, I found it very interesting that we--oh, I shouldn't say interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">That's not--not a good description. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And something I was glad to do that we didn't --we --of course you heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  We were set up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when some of the men who were captured at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> , this 1s five years later, had been prisoners of the Germans all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Not ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> but a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Came back through our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for just a few hours 'cause we were still this little <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and all very --had been wounded seriously and had --had very little care given. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Desperately needed care. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But they weren't interested in that so much as we were the first English-speaking women they had seen in five years, and they wanted to know what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and --and we were so happy and --oh, they were probably there a couple of hours before they went back to the --to the rear, and it was just exciting to talk with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  And to see how excited they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And they had heard that the --they had just heard--because they got no news in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> , no letters from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They had no idea what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but they had just heard that the American soldiers were marrying all of the English women and that was a terrible thing for them to have to hear, and we were happy to tell them not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So then they went on back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I'm sure very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Well, you must have had days and days of very dreary times so to have something like that happen would certainly--
ANSWER:  Be --

<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I think that's probably all that I have to say.</span></p>
