<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I'm here with Hanna Biberstein in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davis</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> and Mrs. Biberstein if you would tell me your full name and your date of birth and your place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Hanna Biberstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born September 14, 1928 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me something about your family background, what your parents did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My father was the last rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother was a native of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> actually and my father married her. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Her mother -- well her father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My grandfather died very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Her mother had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> and my father when he was a young new rabbi came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> and fell in love with her and they married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Where did he come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldorf</span> , <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">His parents, his father was a teacher in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , cantor, teacher, rabbi everything in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was quite a difference between him and his parents because he moved to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and was sort of a modern person in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In his outlook he stayed modern even his ideas are modern today, very open minded individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Of course his parents were from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , very, very old fashioned and we visited them from time to time but it was really a different world, a different culture all together from the way we lived and the way they lived in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Your siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  I have a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She died two years ago and she was two and a half years older than I was and two and half years actually made quite a difference at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I continued going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> , and she went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolon</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and so our lives were quite a bit apart and quite a bit different later on in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were quite different I think in personality, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  When did she leave for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  There were three of them that went together, three friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> , people her age, children her age. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And they left at about eight in the morning and came back by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again five o'clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">She commuted by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Our lives were quite different because I went to the <span class="BUILDING">local Jewish school</span> still at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Did you have a lot of religious ritual in your own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  We had quite a bit but there again I must say my father was a very modern kind of person and he really didn't force us to go when we didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I mean certain things we had to go like the high holidays but on the whole if we really didn't want to go to something or do something he let it be and didn't really insist on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">On the other hand, being children of rabbis or being the wife of a rabbi is not an easy job because you're always scrutinized. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I think the expectations of a rabbi aren't real and the rabbi's family equally -- you're supposed to be a role model and be perfect and so if we did go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so forth it was expected that we behave especially well and be a model. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Looking back I think being associated -- being part of a rabbi's family is quite a strain on the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Was that imposed by your own family or more by society?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  I think that's how it is because much, much later in life in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> my sister married a rabbi also who took over my father's congregation actually and it was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I see it here even now with rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I think the expectations are very great and you expect sort of perfection from everything they touch including the wife and the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Although I think with the wife it's getting a little bit better with the wives now can have more of a life of their own and not insisting that it's not a package deal entirely that they have to go on leading their own lives a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about what you mean about your father being very modern?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Very -- he was not a black and white kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">This 1s the way it's written, this is the way it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He could see different interpretations and people varying the scriptures or the commandments to go with the modern times and what they had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Another thing that just came to my attention recently, when he was a young rabbi and just started apparently there was a discussion in the congregation between the senior rabbi -- he was the junior rabbi then -- the senior rabbi and the congregation about the role of the Polish Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> in that time and the senior rabbi was saying that the Polish Jews should assimilate and learn to speak proper German and should dress the way the rest of the population did and that the way they were acting was bringing on anti-semitism and my father -- this is a newspaper article that I just got -- my father disagreed and said no it was all right for them to keep their own culture and that was not the thing that was bringing on anti-semitism and that it's okay to maintain your own culture and your own environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I think that's a more modern approach, more open minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Open to different ideas, open to the world around you and seeing how Judaism fits into that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  How was he received by the community and his modernize, was that unusual?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Well, apparently very well and of course as a child what I remember is that he was adored by everybody because everybody respected him, but even looking back now in the articles that I read about it, that I have come across recently, 1t seems to have gone over okay with most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now what he was able to do, the Polish Jews had their own little congregation because they worshipped a little differently than the other German Jews and he was sort of able to build to a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> between the two cultures and I think that's a very worthwhile enterprise and was very well received and certainly served everybody well in those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He was also very instrumental in building what was a time place for the young people, a big, big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was established oh about '33 or '34 for the Jewish youth in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> , lots of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for meeting, big huge <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and this was to serve the youth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> , the Jewish youth, but actually the whole community as other things became more and more restrictive the whole community used that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> extensively and he was very instrumental in getting that done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  What about your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  My mother was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My mother was what a was supposed to be in those days, a rabbi's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She was a sort of a shield around my father, she protected him from any criticism or any adverse happenings and was always there to support him and her whole life was also the congregation and she grew up with ideas of the society around her. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">For instance, when we were small she didn't spend much time with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had nursemaids and this and that and that was what was expected of somebody in her position. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It wasn't really until we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we lived together much, much- because we had to -- much, much closer and we became a really close family. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We were not a close family, what I consider a close family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because my father was busy all the time and my mother was busy with other things and we were sort of left most of the time to governesses and nursemaids, what have you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Was your mother a strongly religious person as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I think she did what was expected of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I think that's -- and my father was very religious but he also had many doubts about religion and that's another way where I think he's very modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He was not able to and not willing to just accept everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He had his doubts. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Later on in life when difficult things occurred, like my mother was killed in a plane crash and so forth and he had his doubts along with everybody else, like bad things happening to good people kind of doubts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Describe your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a little bit to me, the environment that you lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Any memories or images that you have of your early childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  My earliest childhood was we lived in a very affluent part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> and what I remember there is just a big <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and it was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and as I said my mother was not in contact with us very much so it was more governesses and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I think I was a very insecure child. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">When I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was very difficult for me and I had a hard time adjusting to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was celebrations -- the holidays were a very wonderful and a very beautiful thing especially I remember the Passover, the the seder nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We'd have a great many people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They were mostly scholars and it was sort of a discussion kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Although I was only allowed to stay for the first part of it, that was always something I really, really looked forward to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The Jewish holidays all together were a major part of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">A major stress too, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">For instance, the high holidays of course my father, that was his work time. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He delivered a great many sermons, especially on the high holidays in a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, it's not supposed to be but it is a performance. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You have to deliver the goods so holiday time was not only a joyous time, it was also a stressful time because that's actually when my father had to work the hardest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Did you always go to his sermons? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Was the family always present?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  No, actually we were not always present, and that was an okay thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">My mother felt that she had to, but we weren't always there, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He gave us actually the freedom to come and go as we chose within reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Holidays or anything big we would be there but otherwise we had sort of a choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Did you take on any of the religious feeling or the sense of religion that your father had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  I think I did, I think I also took on his doubting at the same time that I took on the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Unfortunately part of being the daughter of a rabbi is that you see too much of the congregation and I got really turned off by institutional religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I Just too much of it, but that's more in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> than actually in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">In this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the rabbi didn't have to worry about getting paid or anything like that because part of it came out of the tax money which was then given back to each religion so it was a much stabler kind of job. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , of course, he built up a congregation and he had to see that the money comes and all these things that a rabbi shouldn't have to worry about, but in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they do.</span><span class="sentence" id="90">So, I associate <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> sort of with a lot of stress a lot of in-fighting and not too positive actually I'm sorry to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Was he rabbi at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> from the time that you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Yes, before I was born actually and until we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Were you impressed by it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Oh, it was a beautiful, beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> and on the high holidays the women sat upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I would be with my mother and downstairs the men were and they had high hats and they had their own <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could put them then and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It was a very, very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and very impressive and very awe inspiring really. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember I guess it was one Yom Kippur and you talk about who shall die in the next year and who shall live and so forth and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I remember sitting upstairs with my mother and getting very concerned and very worried and worrying that she might die soon and I kept saying that I hope that she would live until I was at least 16 or 17 which at the time seemed like an ancient age to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And she assured me that yes she thought she would. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Yes, it was a very impressive kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It certainly carried me along during that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  What about your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> life? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Did you play at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a lot with friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  We played at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We had when we moved to the to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> later on we had the -- the sexton downstairs had two children that I played with a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I think my sister actually had more friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She had a great many friends and they visited back and forth quite a bit and I think I was slow in making friends and had few friends but they were good friends probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Do you remember realizing at a particular point that your being Jewish separated you somehow from many other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where you lived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Well, the first time that happened is when I was pretty young, four or five years old or something and when we lived in this nice part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> , the very affluent part with big <span class="DLF">back yards</span> and we liked to play in the <span class="DLF">back yards</span> and my sister and I and sometimes one of her friends also and we were playing there and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door was owned by a family who had one son and he was usually playing there by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, after a while, after watching him a few days and so forth we started a conversation and he seemed very receptive and we got to be very good friends actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Then he got the clever idea that we should carve a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> so that we could go back and forth between the <span class="DLF">yards</span> and we had a big <span class="DLF">sandbox</span> in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> which he liked and he could get at readily and he had sort of berries and things in his <span class="DLF">yard</span> which we didn't have and -- also for hide and go seek you had double the <span class="REGION">area</span> to play in. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">That was a great thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Then it went along very, very well and then one day we came down and the thing was boarded up and we couldn't understand so we kept shouting Harmine, that was the boy's name, to come to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and he wouldn't come and we didn't see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Actually we thought it was all a mistake that somebody probably the gardener or something had seen the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and didn't know that we had permission from both parents to have that and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It shouldn't be this way, I better do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So, we thought 1t would be taken care of shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Then a week or two passed by and we kept shouting for Harmine from the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and we even had the audacity to go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and yell for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He never came to the big <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Finally we approached my mother and asked her to find out what was going on and she really didn't want to do that too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She didn't like to interfere in relationships between children but she said all right if I see the lady I'll speak to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So, another week passed by and she said yes, I saw Mrs. Schmidt but she was just too busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I didn't have a chance to talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Finally one day she came and she said I did see Mrs. Schmidt and she was crying and she was really sorry but she said what had happened is that Harmine had joined the Hitler Youth and at first they thought that was fine and everything was all right and then one day he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after a meeting and he said he just didn't want to have anything more to do with Jews and he wouldn't have anything more to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They should right away board up that <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Not only that, that his parents should have no contact with my parents and shouldn't say hello to them, shouldn't do anything with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Shouldn't talk to us certainly and if they continued doing that that he would report the parents to the authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Mrs. Schmidt was in tears when she said that to my mother because they had been -- not close friends, but you know, cordial, and said hello and chatted for a bit you know on and off and she said she's sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">She was afraid of her son and of what he would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, she really had to say this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There was to be no further contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And of course I was aghast. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Here I was still the same person. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My sister was still the same person. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We actually shared very intimate family secrets and all sorts of things and all of a sudden from one day to the next there was this <span class="DLF">barrier</span> and he couldn't speak to us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was beyond comprehension and I was really upset and it's something that you just -- I couldn't figure out what was going on and why that should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So, that was the first time that something happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Had you ever when you were playing with him had he ever said anything about you being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It never came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Religion had never come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We never discussed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We were busy -- he had a pretty good imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We were making up games and different things and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We were busy with different games. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Then he told us things about his family, what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You know how kids are, complaining about the parents and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We would do the same, but there was never any talk of any religion or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It didn't seem to matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Were you aware that there was a difference between your family and Harmine family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Not at that time, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I think actually at that time my parents still had a lot of non-Jewish friends too. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, we were in contact with non-Jewish people at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Our governess, the people who took care of us were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">SO, so no I didn't consider the problem at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Do you have further instances, further memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Well, the only other thing that happened while we were living in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is my sister and I took piano lessons from a Jewish piano teacher who was supposed to be very good or so they said at the time and we had just started maybe three or four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then all of a sudden he couldn't come anymore and we asked what had happened and first it was oh well, he's not well this week and then it turned out though that he had been arrested and so I asked my mother why would they arrest somebody like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">What did he do, and my mother said from what she could gather he didn't do anything it was just that he was Jewish and that Jews were suspect and that they had arrested him because they suspected him of doing something subversive and so I didn't -- I asked whether that happens quite often and my mother at that time said while it does happen apparently my father was arrested when I was just a baby and apparently there had been a letter that had been forged but had his signature denouncing the government so they had arrested him for a day and then released him, but then again brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the idea that being Jewish was something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You were more suspect certainly and authorities looked on you differently than they would on somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Did you have any understanding of why that was or any rationale for that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  No, and I don't think I questioned it except that that is the way it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It think that's the one thing how easily -- of course I didn't know anything differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I grew up in that atmosphere and how easily you accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This is the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That's all you know and so you know you expected that to be the way the world runs. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, no I didn't question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I just took it for granted that that's the way things are. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So, then well my parents also became very uncomfortable in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and we moved in the , the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> which was adjoining the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was really part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was a <span class="BUILDING">triplex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">three stories actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Then I heard more and more stories of my friends and friends of theirs being beaten up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> because they were Jewish and yelled at because they were Jews or ridiculed because they were Jewish and so I began to realize that that kind of thing did happen and was afraid of going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Not that it happened to me personally although they did yell Jew or something and point across the <span class="DLF">street</span> but I was certainly never beaten up or anything but just hearing that constantly made you very, very aware that the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were not a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And our own life became more and more restrictive although I didn't realize this at the time, but my parents had the good sense to see to it that we were more or less 1n a Jewish environment all of the time so we didn't come in contact with these dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My friends were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">By that time their friends were all Jewish only and they didn't have any contact with anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">One of the nicer things that happened through this is that the people who helped us, our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> help and the people who helped to take care of us had not been Jewish up to now and now we had Jewish help and most of them were young girls who were preparing to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">This was part of their training to learn to take care of a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and children and all that kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Actually for us 1t was much nicer because they were a lot more fun than the people we had been with before so that was a very positive thing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We went to the , the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the youth and joined youth groups and there was a zionist group then that we belonged to and we had a <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> and actually we had everything -- all the activities that other children had we had parallel in the Jewish sphere so that I really didn't feel that I was lacking anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I didn't feel deprived at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was just different and I must say I accepted it as most people and I don't think I questioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I didn't think it was that terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The frightening things were the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">On the <span class="DLF">streets</span> there were children who whenever I saw a crowd of children I'd avoid it and go another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Other children my age don't remember that or other people who were children at that time don't remember it as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I was very frightened of the parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They were always having parades with different banners and I've been told that as a Jew even when the flag, the German flag came by you were supposed to stand still and salute and then I was told afterwards that as a Jew everybody else was supposed to salute but you were never allowed to salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So, I was just petrified because the rules and regulations kept changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That's something that stands out in my mind that I never knew what was right and what was wrong and that I was going to be caught doing the wrong thing and hauled off to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and never heard of again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  So you would try to find your way around the parades?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Yes, and not be caught in a position where I'd have to either salute or not salute, not be around so I wouldn't be caught doing the wrong thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">There were lots of stories that went around, more and more stories of people being deprived of their profession or their <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> being closed or signs <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that people shouldn't be there, Germans shouldn't buy there from <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , and this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But they were removed from me personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They were things that I heard and that I took in but in my own little environment it felt relatively safe and okay at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  So were you able to forget then that this was going on for greater parts of your daily life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Yes, for most of the time, except when I hit the <span class="DLF">streets</span> then I was more careful and I would keep in mind all the things that I'd been told. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">For most of the time it was what I considered a normal life or that's the only thing I knew and it seemed fairly rich life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Why did your family make the decision to move to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Well, because also my father felt that he was being ostracized by the people and it wasn't safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They didn't feel that in the long run that would be a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to live because we were the only Jews in that section. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So, he thought that it would be a good thing to get out of there and more comfortable also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  How did you feel about moving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  We all felt badly about it because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we left was a very, very beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> we moved to was in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a very small <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">On the other hand it had compensations. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It had a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It had a great big veranda that ran the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we could roller skate on top so it did have some compensations for the other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And my friends stayed the same because they were only Jewish by that time anyway so they were not neighborhood people anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So, it was an adjustment to make but it had some good points with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I must say through all the changes that we had to make in our life time our parents were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They sort of had the attitude well, this is just the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They never looked back and said oh, how much better it was here and so forth and there was never any regret. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Whatever came that was it and that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I think we kids began to accept that as sort of our standard attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  So, you don't think that they were heavily depressed by what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  I think they were very heavily depressed by what was going on but they were able to maintain a semblance of normalcy in very abnormal times and did it very well and certainly kept fear away from us as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">As far as giving up oh property or things like that well for a rabbi, that isn't an important thing anyway so that was an easier transition perhaps for us than it was for others because we were really brought up to think that money and these things isn't the main thing in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So, they made that adjustment. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I'm sure they missed it but not so that we children would notice it overly much. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They were very good about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Did they talk to you about the laws?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Not very much and as I say that's part of the thing that the family wasn't as close as it could have been over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They were busy with their things and we were doing whatever we were supposed to be doing but not as much as later on when we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  What about in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were you taught about the laws after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> were created?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  No, of course I was in a very low grade and I think what they tried to do is keep things as normal as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They sort of tried to hide the abnormalities that were going on around us and to maintain the normalcy as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So, actually what I heard was more from other children than any teacher saying anything ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  They would tell you what sorts of things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  The children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Well, they would tell me mostly what I remember was about somebody being beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Meeting somebody and being beaten up by other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Usually at that time that was the main complaint or ridiculed or pants ripped down, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But the teachers tried to sort of maintain a semblance of normalcy through it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That's the amazing thing and I guess that's a survivor mechanism, you know, you don't accentuate the abnormal but sort of try to keep it as normal or stick to the normal <span class="NPIP">part</span> as much as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And they did in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They stayed away from most other things except the subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Did you like <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Well, at first I hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It was very hard for me to adjust to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to being away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and to adjust to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Then I rather liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I wouldn't say I was crazy about it, but I rather liked it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  What sorts of -- what were your favorite things to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Well, I liked reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I was a good reader so I could read to the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They called on people to read to the rest of the class and I was good at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I was never good in arithmetic and that stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But reading and Jewish history and those kinds of things I liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I had a very good teacher most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There were some teachers that had the reputation of being atrocious and used corporal punishment and all that in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">This is an earlier time but I had a very good teacher who was very nice and very understanding really. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I rather enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Recess was the best of course as it always 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We had a big <span class="DLF">school yard</span> and we played.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Did you have any special friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  I had one special friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">As I said my sister had lots of friends and I was very slow in making friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had a very, very good friend in first grade and unfortunately she then emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> so I lost her. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That was really a blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">That really made a great impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">People were constantly at that time leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Whoever could leave was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">There was a leader of our youth group who was about maybe in his twenties, early twenties and I really thought he was the cat's meow. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I thought he was just it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I really had a crush on him and he left for <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and people were -- this community, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was diminishing slowly as people were leaving all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Anybody who was smart enough to read the signs correctly and had the means of getting out, would. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Many had the means of getting out but didn't read the signs correctly, and actually my father had the chance to leave, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in about '34 and '35 and at that time he felt that his <span class="NPIP">place</span> was with the congregation and that he would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I think he must have also thought that he would outlive the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I mean I'm just guessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">It was hard to read the signs correctly because everything happened very gradually, bit by bit it became worse and you adjusted to each little <span class="NPIP">thing</span> very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Then of course the Jews have a history of being oppressed but surviving and so I think a lot of people and I think actually that my father was one of them didn't read the signs correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Now, he says his rational was that he should have stayed, he wanted to stay with his congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That was his <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I'm sure that was part of it, but I also think that I never got the feeling that he expected to happen what did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I don't think anybody could. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I think almost if you thought something like that was going to happen, your view of human nature would be such that you'd commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I mean it 1s such a horrible thing to have happened that I don't think the average person can imagine it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">If you did, if you had that view of human nature, I think it would be practically impossible for you to go on living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  I think there has to be a limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Yes, it's just something that the human mind can't fathom. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It's beyond what we can understand and take in. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, I don't think he read the signs correctly, and I don't really blame him for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Did you feel yourself that you wish you could emigrate after your closest friend had left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  I think at that time everybody did feel that they would like to. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That was pretty late already. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Everybody felt that this was becoming more and more oppressive and it would be a good thing if you could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And of course <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was already built up as the place, paradise on earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Although <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was too, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, so either one of those was the dream worlds, but we weren't living in the dream world, but it wasn't at that point it wasn't a horrible world. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It was a world that was imperfect and there were depravation and you had to live with a certain amount of hardship, but it was not an impossible world to live in at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  What was the next major thing that happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  The next major thing that happened was the deportation of the Polish Jews, of Jews that were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that was a shattering moment in my life and certainly took away any kind of security that I had up to then. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That -- I remember that day vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It started early in the morning and I woke up and instead of the usual breakfast being prepared and so forth I heard all sorts of phone calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">People coming in and out and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Then my parents said that as far as they could gather at that point, that they were collecting all the Jews of Polish decent and didn't know what they were going to do with them but they were gathering them and they were all in the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> and they were herding them together there and nobody knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The telephone was ringing as more people reported somebody else being rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So my mother informed us that there was not going to be any <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Actually there was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for my sister who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolone</span> and she had left for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already but that I wasn't going to have any <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that day which was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That my father and my mother and the sexton and his wife and everybody would be busy that day and that I should go downstairs and play with the sexton's children. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They had an old grandfather who usually stayed in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but that was enough supervision if anything terrible happened, he could take care of us, and that they would be gone trying to help the Polish Jews in whatever way they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So, I went downstairs to my playmates and they had heard of somebody being rounded up and we'd throw out names and we had no idea really what was going on or how serious it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The grownups seemed excited and seemed worried so we thought it must be serious but we had no idea actually what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We were by ourselves down there and lunchtime came and nobody showed up and nobody told us anything and we were wondering so we prepared lunch and fixed lunch and then things got to be very, very boring and so we decided to play hide and go seek which was our favorite game at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Since everybody was gone we could use the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> which also connected with the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> so it was a huge, huge thing with <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> going all ways and very, very little lighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It was really a spooky kind of <span class="NPIP">place</span> and perfect for hide and go seek. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We weren't really supposed to play there. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That was sort of forbidden territory but we'd been there before and we thought everybody's gone, this would be a good day to explore all the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> that we hadn't explored in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, we went down there and played and I must say we forgot -- or at least I forgot all about what was going on with the Polish Jews or anything else that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We were wrapped up in our games. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Then we suddenly became aware that there was another person. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There was somebody else down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">First the boy, my friend, saw him first and then the rest of us saw it and we stealthily crept up there to see who it was and what was going on, who'd be down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">As we came close this person turned around and he was frightened, absolutely frightened, petrified and garbled something which we couldn't understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We on the other hand recognized that it was one of our Jewish teachers, teacher from our <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and we couldn't figure out what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He was just shoving and pointing the other way for us so we decided we better leave him alone, he's not quite right in the mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He was sort of strange anyway we thought, but stranger than usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So, we decided he wants to be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He obviously doesn't want us here so we better go and we thought it's probably time for us to check upstairs because we didn't want to be missed by anybody who came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so we went back and couldn't figure out what this teacher was doing there and why he was acting so strangely and so frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We couldn't understand even what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We got upstairs and then the parents of my friends, the sexton and his wife came back and they were sitting there and they were very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were tired too. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They were tired and very depressed and telling all the things that they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Apparently the Polish Jews had been rounded up and they couldn't gather any of their things together so anything they could throw into a suitcase if a suitcase was handy they could take, but they were only given five or ten minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Once they got to the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> , they found all sorts of things that they were missing, so the rest of the Jewish population was busy that whole day scrounging around trying to give them the necessities at least that they would need for a trip, which obviously they were going to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Also, to get some food to them, lunch and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Then, just before the sexton and his wife came back, it had been announced that all the Polish Jews were to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , to the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and they were all marched down there and it's then that everybody found out that they were supposed to be shipped back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Everybody was just devastated by the event. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">These were some of our close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now, the teacher that we had -- well, some of our close friends were caught in that and then the parents asked what we'd been doing and my friend said that we had been down there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and that we came across the teacher, the Jewish teacher and what was he doing down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The parents became very upset that we had been down there and what we had seen and they rushed to the phone and called my parents and after talking to them my friends parents came back and said that my parents wanted me upstairs to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I thought it was something to do with being in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we weren't supposed to play and I went up there and I already knew what I was going to tell them and the reasons why this had to be and when I got up there, both my father and my mother were there to talk to me and that was very rare that my father would bother to get involved in this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They had asked what had happened and I told them that we had seen this teacher acting very peculiar, very strange and they got very, very serious and they said what we had seen was very dangerous if we would divulge it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It would be very dangerous, not only to the teacher but to our family and to everybody else and that what had happened was early in the morning when all these people were calling in saying that the Polish Jews were being rounded up and this family was rounded and this family was rounded up, my father somehow thought of this teacher and was able to contact him before they arrived at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and had said that he could hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So, it was obviously imperative that nobody knew that he was there and that it would be very dangerous if anybody found out for instance that my father had contacted this man and sort of given him a sanctuary there for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So, it was made very, very clear that under no circumstances should I divulge what I had seen and where he was and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I was just frightened to death, frightened to death of the whole thing realizing for the first time I think, I was realizing what had really happened to the Polish Jews because up until then I really hadn't fathomed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It was sort of first they were herded together 1n the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> and so forth and it was only after this all happened and they really were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that I realized the tragedy of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So, I was overcome by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I was also frightened that somehow in my sleep or some way I would give way to what I had seen and that he was there and I just wish I'd never been there and the responsibility of keeping the secret just became a great burden to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I was just hoping I wouldn't tell anybody without meaning to. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So, then it was then really after listening to the other parents and to my parents that I realized the full impact of what had happened to the Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was already late afternoon, it was Friday night, so we got ready for the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we dressed up as we usually did and I think everybody who is Jewish was gathered there and everybody was crying and trying to console each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Now, this I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It has been told to me that my father gave a very stirring sermon sort of saying that the Polish Jews that this is just the first chapter, that similar things would be awaiting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I was really too tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I think I fell asleep actually in the evening and afterwards when they told me about the sermon I really didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean the Polish Jews was one thing but to us, to my family that that would happen I really didn't believe it or couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I think there were quite a few German Jews who at that time still didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It's just hard to picture that this kind of thing happens to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So after that day, there was no sense of security that anybody had after that anymore because if you can take such a mass of people and uproot them within a few hours and shove them of to another unknown <span class="NPIP">part</span> after that we thought that things could happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  Let's just go back a little bit to when you were at your friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the children of the sexton and you had come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and you were hearing about all of things that were happening, were there a lot of people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and somebody coming in and making reports and then leaving or how were you learning about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Early in the morning you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Just after you had come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  No, it was just what the sexton and his wife was telling us and then what my parents had said what had happened, but apparently every able person who had time was there at the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> doing the same thing that they were doing, gathering things for the Polish Jews that they needed, providing food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So, my father tells this story that one of the Polish Jews that he was helping, handing him some food said but doctor who's going to do that for you when your time comes? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I think my father at that time realized that this was the beginning of the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  So your parents actually spent a good part of the day at the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  The whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">From morning until five or six o'clock until the people boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And so did the sexton and his wife and so I understand did most of the Jewish population that was able to take the time and help out. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">There were a great many people and they were all with them until they were finally boarding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  What happened next in between that time in October of '38 and then between that time and crystal night? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Just that there was great fear and I guess I was more leery of anybody that wasn't Jewish when I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There was just a greater feeling that things might go wrong and I don't think there was a radical change except a change in how you personally felt, you know how each person felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They had seen just great savagery done to great fellow Jews and after that they were not certain of their position, a great uncertainty and a great fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Did the teacher stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  The teacher actually in some way and I didn't learn this until much later, the teacher escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The teacher is now living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He was in love at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One of the reasons I said that he was sort of weird, he was in love at the time with another Jewish teacher at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He was sort of a dreamer and we always saw him -- we thought he was composing love poems or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We always ridiculed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The two of them are married now and live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">End of Tape 1 Tape 2
QUESTION:  Crystal night I suppose would be the next very significant memory that you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">In fact, when I was writing the memoirs I realized how close the deportation of the Polish Jews is in time to the crystal night. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">To me in my mind in my memory it seems like half a year or a year whereas it's a little less than a month actually between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But, that's not the way I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">As a child I remember it just being a long span of time between the deportation of the Polish Jews and crystal night. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">That was the next big chapter and after that there was no doubt as to what you had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You had to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I mean there wasn't any -- after the Polish Jews I still as a child thought well it's them but not me, they wouldn't do that to German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">That was my as a child that's how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But obviously after crystal night 1t became obvious that all Jews were the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We were at stake. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So, that was -- well apparently my sister remembers and I'm quoting partly from my sister's memories now and not only my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">My sister remembers that the evening before in the evening the my father got a phone call and he tells the same thing and it was an anonymous caller who somehow warned him that during the night there would be parades. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There would be a procession and there would be marches and that somehow they were going to be against the Jews and that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> might be in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">That's all that they said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Did you know anything about Hershel Greenspan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  I did not, no, I did not at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So, as I say in a way my parents protected me and the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Everybody else protected me maybe too much but we were quite protected and things that would upset us greatly or make us very fearful were really talked about as little as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So, I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Apparently my father got this phone call during our meal time and came back very agitated and the meal continued and then my mother told us that a good friend of hers who was also a -- who took a very special interest in me or a nurse by the name of , was going to spend the night with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as usual and nothing much really occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">My father tells later on that after the phone call he didn't know quite whether to believe it or not because there had been so many false warnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">People were always imagining things sometimes there were real dangers involved but there were a lot of warnings and a lot of them turned out to be false. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So, he obviously didn't believe that the things would go the way they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">On the other hand, he took some precautions. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He asked this friend of ours to come and stay with us and there was a beggar who lived all the way up in the dome of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he went up there about three or four times a week and slept up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The stories that I was told as a child was that he was really a very rich man that he was hoarding all those things up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I was never up there and I don't even know how he got up there but apparently he came that evening and they told him not to go up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So I think they half believed it and half didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">If he would have believed it all the way he obviously wouldn't have kept his family in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So, it was sort of a mixture between taking some precautions but not going overboard with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Then during the night there was a lot of noise and when I woke up the lights were on and my mother came in and said that the gestapo went in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that my sister and I should get dressed right away and get ready to leave and that she would be downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">My father's <span class="INT_SPACE">study</span> was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and the sexton lived on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And she would be on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> with my father and I think I was in a state of shock when the whole thing happened because I just followed orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I was supposed to get dressed and we were supposed to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Now, my understanding at the time was that we would leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had no idea -- crazy orders like that were the norm so I didn't question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Okay, so they wanted us to leave, okay, and then obviously we would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So, we got dressed and we were in no special hurry actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">My sister and I in fact this was November and some of our Hanukkah presents had already arrived from my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and my sister knew that her very nice shirts were up on the top shelves where we weren't supposed to get at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">When she was getting dressed since we were going to leave she got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , pulled down the package, put on that nice shirt and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">People would come in and say we have to leave and we said yes, yes we'll have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We're getting ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I personally was sort of waiting for my parents to come and to take us or tell us what to do and they weren't coming and there was a lot of noise downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My father apparently was with my mother and the gestapo and finally the sexton ran up and said okay you've got to go, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> is burning, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And so I don't even remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I remember being shoved. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I did not want to leave because I thought my parents were still someplace in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I wasn't going to go without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They finally kept pushing me and pushing me to the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and then when we got to the second story, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> there was an SS person and he was just smashing everything in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">We had <span class="DLF">glass doors</span> and glass windows and a lot of figurines and he was just smashing things and kicking things and our orders though they kept pushing no no you've got to go, you've got to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So, we ran down -- as we were going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bottom floor</span> , we saw the flames from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> coming over to our <span class="DLF">staircase</span> and they were already on the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> as we were going down. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And down on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> also was the sexton's father, the old gentleman who always lived with them and he was in his long white nightgown just standing there petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They did the same thing with him that they did with me, they were just pushing him out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Then one of the most frightening things was as we came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they were paving the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with these cobblestones and they were throwing these stones through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the sexton and family apparently when they first heard the gestapo coming and were told that they had to leave had ordered some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> for us and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Somehow we had to get across that <span class="DLF">street</span> where they were throwing the cobblestones and not get hit by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I was just frightened to death and there was no way that I could see or that we could see doing that and they kept throwing and suddenly somebody said they're just children, let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And they did stop and we crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they resumed right away to throw the things so we were able to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> which when we were standing there with all those stones coming right where we had to walk across seemed like an impossible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Then I was still unwilling to really let go because I really thought that my parents were in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> still but when we got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> there they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They had come out by another <span class="DLF">exit</span> and so we all went to the Jewish nurse's home where there were three Jewish nurses living together, and the sexton's family and us we went there and we were absolutely -- as I say, I still think I had not taken in, even though I lived through it, I didn't really live through it until about a day afterwards until it sank in what had really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I was sort of pushed this way and pushed that way and I remember -- the only thing I really remember, there were two things I remember as being terribly frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The one thing was that I thought that my parents were still in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the second thing was the cobblestones and how to get to the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and not get hit and those are the two things that vividly stand out but the rest of it I think I was just like a sort of robot, was doing what I was told to do but not really taking in too much of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> took us to the <span class="BUILDING">nurse's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Then in the course of the day we heard that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was just the first <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> to be destroyed but they were going to every <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> and taking the males and taking them off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Often destroying the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , often injuring the people and so when these reports came in my father realized that what he should do -- since they didn't know where he was because he had escaped, we had left the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> before the order to arrest all Jewish men had come through, so they didn't know where he was and he took off and for the next two weeks he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He was actually in different <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and would call in from time to time that he was okay but he was still not arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So, he was gone and we were sitting there and as more and more reports came in we felt that -- and I especially got very frightened then and thought okay, they did our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but they haven't been to the <span class="BUILDING">nurse's home</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They haven't been here, so when are they going to come, and what are they going to do this time when they come because one of the stories that still sticks out in my mind 1s that one somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> whose <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they had visited and the husband when he came out and said what are you doing here or something like that they took a pencil and stuck it through his eyeball and that memory still is in my mind something vivid like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We heard other stories and so it was very, very difficult for me when night time came to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I had nightmares and it was really got to the point that I was thinking in the evenings okay let them come, let's get it over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It's done. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They'll only visit this <span class="NPIP">place</span> once and when it's done, it's done and it was very hard for anybody to reassure me that we would not be visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">My mother and the sexton's family and I guess a lot of other Jewish families tried to call the police from time to time, very naive but you try anything you can and the police were considered the good guys as compared to the SS and to see what <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were on the list for that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Of course they could get no answers and could get no protection but they tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I remember every evening them dialing the police and trying to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">This went on for about a week or more and as I say I was just petrified -- it seemed having that in front of you seemed much worse to me, much more fearful than having gone through it when I was sort of in neutral and really didn't take it in, what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But once I realized what had happened and then having to face that again some of the things that I had heard just seemed unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, all of us were living there together. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There were ten of us by then living together in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> meant for three so we were all doubling up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , doubling up everywhere and everybody on edge. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">It was a very, very difficult time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Were you reflecting on what had happened that night and learning from your parents, from your sister the different experiences that each of you had had, or were you quiet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  Actually, I think that I got some of these stories about what had happened with my father and my mother when they were downstairs with the SI, my mother told us how they goaded my father and said well what do you think about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Your beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> going up in flames and they were half drunk and to my mother they seemed very dangerous which is the reason that she stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I guess one asked him for a book, would he consider to give him a book that my father would think worthwhile for this SI man to have and they could never figure out whether the SI man was serious in that or whether he was being sarcastic and I think my mother could never figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So, we shared some of these -- I told my mother of course what had gone on with us so all that was shared at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">In the long run, people remembered the story differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There were four of us in the family and each one has four different remembrances of what happened, but that's not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The main facts remain the same, but they're slightly different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  What did you think of these people who were destroying your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Were you able to think of them as being human?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Not human, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I did not think of them as human. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">No, I did not think of them as being human not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Some kind of animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">That was just beyond everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In fact, I didn't think of the Nazis afterwards as human. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">No human being that I had ever met could do things like that or would do things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">A different species all together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  For the next several weeks then you lived in this very small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  From November until March and that was a very trying time for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">My father returned after they were not arresting people anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was a very trying time because there were ten of us living there in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was meant for three. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Everybody was very tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Everybody was terribly worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I remember vaguely that there were squabbles about who could use the telephone because everybody needed the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We were all trying to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The need to rescue ourselves, our families, and there was tension about who could use the phone when, and who was using the phone too much, and who was going to cook and even adjusting to all these things in very unfavorable conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I mean everybody was not at their best. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Everybody was very, very uptight and tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Also <span class="BUILDING">school</span> went on but it was only a few hours a day because some of the teachers had gone, a lot of the children had gone, so there was a lot of free time for us kids, free time and not much to do and the adults were busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They were trying to make arrangements to get out of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">My father was busy making arrangements for other people also to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and so they were taken up with other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We couldn't go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and play on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">There was no <span class="DLF">backyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> weren't safe for us obviously and the <span class="NPIP">place inside</span> was very small, so there really wasn't much to do so there were a lot of squabbles among us kids too and we devised a way sort of mediation, if you get into a fight with this one, you go to this one first, and this one first and the parents were then the last resort. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">To keep us occupied since we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what we wanted was something to do, some job where we could earn some money too. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">My job was to polish the shoes for everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> every day and then I got some allowances something at the end, but at least it took time and kept us busy and I think the adults were hard put to keeping everybody busy and occupied at a time like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">My parents were busy with the trying to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I remember also that the people who were arrested crystal night were then, most of them were released within a few weeks, but they came back in terrible condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Their heads had been shaven and stubble and you know wounds, they looked really as if they had been mishandled. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I remember one of them that was a relative of the sexton coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He had just gotten out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he was going to come, and I know how I felt before I saw him, I thought oh I'm going to just go up there and give him a great big hug and kiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Then I saw him with shaven head and so I was just appalled. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I was really taken aback. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I did not go up and kiss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I was just shocked at the way he looked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  Do you remember games that you played?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  During that time, I really don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">No, I don't know if it was anything different than we had done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was a very restrictive time and I think we did a lot of reading and quiet things were looked upon very favorably in that surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">The thing that kept me going was that everybody shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with somebody else because there obviously weren't enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> to go around and this head nurse who had been my friend from the time I was very small little girl, I used to spend weekends with her and so forth, and I shared her big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feather bed</span> with her and that always made me feel more secure than I did at any other time that I was there with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We played games -- she played games with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">She in her feather bed she would build <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and have people coming through very imaginative kinds of things that she would do to keep me occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We were on the same wave length sort of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Did that give you any hope, that security?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Not hope, but it helped me to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It made me feel more comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Did you have hope? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Were you focused on getting out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  Yes, completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Well, I think everybody realized at that time that the only hope was to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We weren't going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There was no way you could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't think there was any doubt then in anybody's mind, even the ones who had denied many things before, didn't read the tea leaves very well, were sure that that was the time that you had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And so I remember having to go -- there were two ways you could get out, by quota or like my family did, if you had a special visa because you had a special profession and had a job waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We had both. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We had a quota which was coming up fairly soon and then we were able to get the other thing also, but the quota would have been earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I remember having to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studtgard</span> to the American consult as a family to see if the quota, the number would work. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I remember the responsibility I felt of myself that somehow I was supposed to behave, give the right answers, do the right thing and that was up to me to carry this thing off and I remember when it didn't work, the number didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We came the other way, that when the quota thing ended they said no this is not going to work, I thought that this personally was somehow my fault, that 1 had probably done something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Not made a good impression or not smiled the right way or whatever it was that this didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So there was a -- I think everybody felt a great deal of responsibility for trying to get out and also we felt very much that we shouldn't bother our parents with anything, or any adult for that matter because they were all -- first of all they didn't have time for it, really they didn't at that point and they were so preoccupied with just the basic necessities of making things go from day to day and trying to make plans for getting out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you would have lessons for several hours a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  So you would actually go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Yes, we would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a few hours a day, but 1t was very short, a very abbreviated day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  How would you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  We walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We always walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Walking was the norm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Did you feel was it scary to walk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Yes, well it was even more so -- of course I wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">The sexton's children, the four of us, or the three of us rather, we'd walk together. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But walking was the way we always went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and it was only a few hours a day at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Were you ever threatened while walking during that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  I really must say I personally, fortunately never was, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I was one of the lucky ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  During that time, did you begin to question more your identity and whether you had any responsibility for what was happening on a grander scale or were you able to say this 1s because these animals have --
ANSWER:  I think that was completely my attitude that these animals have -- no I never felt that the Jews had done something wrong because I knew that -- first of all I thought of my parents as being near perfect at that stage and I knew that they hadn't done anything wrong and looked what had happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">No, I didn't feel that the Jews had done anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">No, I felt it was just part of a repetition of past history kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I didn't feel that the Jews were at fault at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Did you believe that there was a place that you could go where Jews were not treated in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Well, I thought there would be a place in the world where the Jews could live and I knew they couldn't live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Now there might be restrictions there too and I sort of assumed at that point that all Jews lived under some restrictions but at least they lived and they weren't going to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I think that was pretty obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  How did you eventually find a way to emigrate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  That's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Actually everybody looked for relatives in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and somehow there was an article about my father in a newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and it so happened that we discovered a very rich aunt on <span class="DLF">Park Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and she was able to underwrite this special visa for professionals if they had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The way she got my father a job is that she went to rabbi who was a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and she said I will give you a monthly payment of so much and you pay it to Rabbi Hahn and we'll call it a job for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">That's how we were actually able to go this special visa who was for professionals who had a job in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was sheer luck and I think that's one of the things that when I read about the Holocaust and when I see pictures of the Holocaust it always comes to me how easily it could have been me. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">How easily, it's just sheer chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It's just an amazing thing that that happened and as I say there's always a little bit of I can't get over how lucky I am to be alive, because it's sheer chance that we happened to be able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">The people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> that were killed is just tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There were very few survivors, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  What was the date? </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Do you remember when you found out that you were going to be able to emigrate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  We came over in March of '39, so it was maybe February, when it was finalized that they were going to accept this. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">There was also a question whether they would accept this doctored up job. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Once we found out that 1t would be okay, it was just a few weeks before we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  Do you remember the mood during that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  Once we found of course well, when we found out that this was going to happen, we were of course very, very happy and of course, very, very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="579"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1s just such a - in a way you're happy because you're going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">On the other hand you're afraid of what the new <span class="NPIP">place</span> will hold for you and complete readjustment and having to start from scratch in an unknown <span class="NPIP">place</span> , not knowing the language very well, although we had been studying English but it didn't amount to much. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So, I mean we were very happy on the other hand you feel terrible about the people you're leaving behind and you don't know whether they will now get out or how they'll get out and one of the ones was my grandmother who later died in and my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then the person who was very important in my life this head nurse who I was very, very close to and we were leaving her. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Fortunately though I learned much, much later that she did escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> after we left, so she was able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It was a big relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I mean there's no doubt that there was a big relief when we found out that we could leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The first feeling is one of being relieved and the second feeling is oh my but how is this really going to work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">How am I going to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">How are we going to survive under these conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And then leaving a lot of friends, a lot of people we were very fond of. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">My sister especially had a boyfriend she was very close to who she left behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Were there still ten people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  There were still, yes, and the others then, the sexton and his family later I guess were able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> , so they did escape also, but we left before they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  So you left from this little <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  We went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> and then took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> and I remember on the train trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> of course everybody was in tears and I remember my mother crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">My mother hadn't cried very much during this whole time and my mother was crying and I was very upset that my mother was crying and I asked my father what she was crying about and he said well, she's crying because she's worried about all the suitcases that we are taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">What's she going to do with them in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> are very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Then I came forth with oh well we can store them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> or this or that and he said well I'll tell her and that will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I remember being terrible concerned about the suitcases and how we were going to store them properly once we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Then we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamberg</span> and got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and because we couldn't take any money out we went first class because we spent it all on that, and almost everybody was seasick the whole trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Except one day there was big meals and I think I was the only one in the family who was able to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I went by myself into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were serving tea and I had tea by myself because everybody else in the family was sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  How long did the trip take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  Close to a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Maybe five or six days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  Did you meet people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> who were escaping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Similar -- no not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They were mostly tourists actually.. I met some American boys who I thought were my age and I tried to study what they were saying, trying to prepare for what was ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Were you feeling hopeful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Yes, actually I was, but I didn't know all the change that was ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It was much more difficult for my parents obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">When we landed here this relative of ours, the one that rescued us actually, was there to meet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">My parents had actually been studying English for a year, year and a half, found out they really couldn't understand a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They didn't speak very much and this relative of ours was a very well to do lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">She had a black maid and was very fancy and she took us to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we had lunch there and it was really very uncomfortable I think for everybody even though we were very, very grateful to her but the communication and the lifestyle and I guess we didn't know what was expected, what was good manners, what was the right thing to do and what was the wrong thing to do and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Then there was another very wealthy person who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> who had left before us and they had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scarsdale</span> and they said that after we arrived we could stay with them for a while until we decided what we were going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So, we moved out to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">These were people who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">They had sort of a big, big <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , almost a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> and I was always in awe of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The way my family talked about them I always felt it was like the king or something like that, some exalted person and we were going to live in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I was also concerned was I doing the right thing, was I doing the wrong thing and so I had a meal there and I remember them saying well, we suggested that we help with washing up and so my sister and I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and started to help wash up and I saw for the first time they used soap to wash the dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I wasn't used to that and so afterwards I said you know what they do, they use soap on the dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We hadn't done that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I don't think it was a very comfortable time for my parents either even though it was a very generous thing and obviously we needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Then we stayed there for about three or four weeks and then my father decided what he was going to do was build up a German Jewish congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> even though everybody had told him it had been attempted many times and they have failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But he was going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Of course he had the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of this rabbi who he was supposedly working for and so he started building a congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Actually he was very, very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The congregation is in existence today and my brother-in-law was the second rabbi and they have an American rabbi now. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He did do well. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We then moved to, first we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hugh Gardens</span> into a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and our furnishings and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> hadn't come yet so we were borrowing things from people around and it was one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Now we had come from a -- well of course after crystal night we lived in very cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> but before that we lived in a 14 room <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we were used to upscale living certainly with people to help around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , two or three of them anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So, we were in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with my parents sleeping in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">studio couch</span> which could be converted into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and having no money, and my mother was not used to housework or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She had never done that in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">That's what I was saying before, the wonderful thing about my parents is they took things as they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They never complained or they never said oh but in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I had it so differently and poor me, what I have to do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They never made us feel that. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They never made us feel deprived or that this was a terrible hardship and I really admire them for that because it was such a change, especially for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">She never complained about it though, just took it that that's the way things are. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I remember there was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I remember that since they were borrowed things we were supposed to be very careful about them, but there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> either so I was doing- we were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by that time, and I was doing homework and somehow I was writing in ink and I put an ink spot on the cover of this down cover and we tried to get it out and we couldn't get it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">My mother was just beside herself and I felt terrible and when our own stuff came then we finally returned it and my mother apologized and she could not get over how that could happen that there was this big spot on this blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Things were very hard financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I remember we never had icecream because that was too expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they used to have cookies at recess a penny or so a piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I was allowed to have that once every second week, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">We just lived -- we had the bare minimum. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But as I say, the good thing was that my parents really didn't complain about it and didn't say well in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we had this and this and this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you even grew closer as a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Much closer, because there was nobody between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">My mother took over motherly things that she hadn't done before because somehow she grew up with the idea that she had to live a certain way and she accepted that and one of them was that you had other people take care of your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I don't think she ever questioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">She became a real mother, got very involved in our lives and we became a very close knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That was the very, very positive part. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And she enjoyed it and I think afterwards she realized how much she had missed by not having it or doing it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">She took to it naturally and it was very much a part of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">As a family we lived in this very, very tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> together and so we became much more involved and I think we shared a lot of things whereas they didn't share that much with us in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , partly because they didn't think it was proper and partly to protect us, but here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we were really involved in the ups and downs of the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">This is where I get my ideas of congregational life because we were very involved in what everybody said, what every member said or any criticism that went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Were you going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  In this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  No, it was just a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">At that time their theory was just plunk the kids into the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and eventually they'll catch on and I think actually that's the best way to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It may be very, very hard but at least you do learn it and you learn it in a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I think within three or four weeks I was participating first in math and then in the other things and there was only one other German Jewish boy in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I think maybe even in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but anyway there was one in my class and he would refuse to speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He was an American by then and he refused to own up to the fact that he could speak German and understand German. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, I wasn't able to communicate with him and he was no help to me because he was an American by then and wouldn't have anything to do with refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  Did you reflect during that time a lot upon your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the events that had led up to your leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Yes, very very much and especially as we heard -- well we were very worried about what was happening to the people we had left behind and reflected it on very, very much of my life and always because I reflected on it really felt separate from the other kids for a long long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I remember still when I was in <span class="BUILDING">collage</span> I'd think to myself when I'm going to marry it's only going to be to somebody who has had the same experience I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don't think anybody could understand me who hasn't gone through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Actually, that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It was a very strong feeling of feeling very separate from people. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I felt that I'd seen much more, knew much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I was apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Did people ask you where you came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  What did you tell them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  I said <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Well, they knew it by my accent and everything else and actually German refugees was very common at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Did they know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Oh yes, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">That never posed a problem all the time I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  They weren't curious at all about your background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  No, they didn't ask much and I must say I didn't volunteer much and I was sort of also trying to get accepted as being one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So, differences that I had I wasn't willing to accentuate at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I was sort of on the same wave length as this other boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I was trying to become Americanized to be accepted to be part of the group, rather than pointing up differences of what I had known, what I had seen, what I had gone through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  How did those early years in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> influence you in the few years that were following as you were a teenager and growing up and being an American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Well, I think that it made me realize -- it made me more pessimistic of human nature of people and of what can happen in the world and I think also I realized how important it is to stand up for what you think and what you believe and I think the feeling to do the right thing, social justice and so forth became very important in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It has been very important in my life, along with the feeling that anything can happen anywhere, any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It can happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I think it's with you, not consciously, but I think it's with you all your life that you just have this certain knowledge of things that other people don't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">You don't even think they can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">In my case I didn't really want to bring it up too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It's mine, it's part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I know it's there and because I felt that others might not understand or reject I sort of kept it to myself rather than share it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Do you believe that people here were different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  No, because the people I had known before were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Some of them like . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I didn't feel they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I felt they were very kind but I didn't feel that you couldn't change. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I guess that's what I mean by my basic feeling of pessimism because I didn't think that could ever happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">My father was one of the most respected people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esson</span> , very well known, at one point had a lot of non-Jewish friends and so forth, and it happened to him so I guess I sort of had the feeling that anything is possible given certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Has your father remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Yes, he was a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , well he retired and then he died a little later and my brother-in-law took over the congregation before my father retired and my brother-in-law has now passed away too and so has my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But it's a thriving congregation still. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">When I go back there some of the people, people who knew me from the time I was ten years old, they're now in their eighties, high eighties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Could you just tell me a little bit when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for how long before you met your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  I came over when I was ten and I met Ernie when I was 17, so seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He was in the army and actually it's one of those things that he was on furlough and his parents invited my family and children to come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Actually, the way it worked is they invited my sister who 1s two and a half years older, but they felt that I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So, I didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I wasn't invited, I wasn't included in the invitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Then my parents invited his parents back and that's when we met for the first time and the thing with my sister and Ernie didn't work out but he decided that he was interested in me but my sister who was a very domineering kind of person didn't take kindly to that so he didn't know how to get out of it so what he did is arrange for a double date and asked us and I thought it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I thought I was going to go with a friend and Ernie was going to go with my sister because that's how it had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I thought they liked eachother and that's how it had been arranged originally and we were going to a concert in <span class="BUILDING">Lewis Stadium</span> and we were going to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and as we were boarding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> I was going with this other guy and he said no, no, you go with me and they go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So, then we got to the concert and my sister was just furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">She wouldn't talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">This poor guy who happened to be a very nice guy just wouldn't talk to him the whole time and then we got back and then we started dating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  When did you marry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  I was twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I got married, I finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in three years and during that time first he was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and then he was up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and would come and visit, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> down actually which was quite a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">There was a certain amount of friction, we had German families that we had dealings with and his family was much more old fashioned than my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They had the idea that when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , that he should first come to see them and he shouldn't see me and our idea was that we should meet first in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and then he could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">There were arguments all the time about his role towards his parents and towards me. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Eventually, after we got married we spent a summer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and that solved all problems for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">When we came we just shuffled back and forth between the families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  Well we were first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> for three years and then Ernie graduated and was in practice for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Then he came back and he got his Phd which was another three years and two of our children were born during that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Then after that we came out here and the other two were born out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Actually the life at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> was one of the best parts we both think of our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We were graduate students and we lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">housing project</span> and everybody there had no family but lots of them had little kids and it was a nice community. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We helped each other out. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">There was always somebody there for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">It was very congenial living even though you had no money but it wasn't hopeless because everybody knew eventually once they finished their studies they'd be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So, that was one of the nice parts actually looking back on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  What were you studying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He was studying veterinarian medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Cornell is a <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> and I had a job for a while in a <span class="BUILDING">flower store</span> , not much of a job and then we were in practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">When he was in <span class="BUILDING">practice</span> I had another secretarial job. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Then when we came back I was pregnant and had children at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">You were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with kids, there was no child care or anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  And you've lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davis</span> for 40 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">It's been a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to raise children. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">A bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> for teenagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I think they get sort of bored with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Now that you've had the span of our lifetime and you've had years to reflect on your early childhood and you mentioned your feeling of pessimism after you arrived, has that remained?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  Yes, it has, it really has. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I don't see how it could ever leave you after you've seen first hand what you have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">You can't erase that. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was so many people I remember when the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burning when we were coming out, there was a whole crowd there standing there and cheering and they were throwing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It wasn't one or two individuals doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It was a whole big population. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So, yes, I don't see how you can wash that away or come to any other conclusion that it's possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  What's given you hope and kept you going all these years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  Well I think the hope is that you have to show people and alert people to the dangers and make them aware that when they see an injustice you have to stand up right away because if you don't do it right away, later on you can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">That was certainly with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">When some of them finally realized, it was too late for them to even do something without endangering themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Conclusion of Interview </span>
