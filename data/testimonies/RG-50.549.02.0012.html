<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And also, for the record, your father's full name and your mother's full name, including her maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My father's name was David Goldensile. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My mother's name was Hosa Einhorn and they- my father, fortunately, passed away a natural death. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with her grandson in her arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">She took her grandson so that my sister should live, because young women with children were destined to be killed the same way as older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Though my mother was by no means old, she was 56 years old, but this was considered by the Nazis, old. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Even 40 year o-old was -- were killed, had no chance of surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Were you parent -- your parents were from the town <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Yasinna</span> , Poland -- Czechoslovakia, as you mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Had your family lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> for a long time, for generations before or did they come from elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  No, not into -- not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My -- my parents -- one of -- my mother came from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was at the time <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">| can't re-remember exactly, the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he was only two years old and he came to the <span class="REGION">area</span> that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">At the time when my father came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> , that part was not <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , but when I was born, it was of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> , by then it was already <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in existence, modern, since 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So we were taken away, I mean, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> because I had to run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> in -- in 1940, so that is about 26 years, was in existence, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What language did your family speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  We s -- our mother language was Jewish, but we spoke several languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Is -- my father was perfect in German, in fact he was teaching German and so we spoke Jewish, we knew German, Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then when the Hungarian occupied us, I really had to make a crash course, learning very quickly Hungarian, which I did for just to survive, because if I went to hide, I had to know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an aptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you attend, did you attend <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  No, Czech, Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">There was Jewi -- there was no Jewish school, there was only, if -- if you wanted to privately then you -- you went to, you know, like for people [inaudible] have to learn how to -- how to pray, but that was not in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , there was only, if -- if you wanted to privately then you -- you went to, you know, like for people [inaudible] have to learn how to -- how to pray, but that was not in the schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We had just Czech <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and also Russian, because in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there lived a -- a great many, they were U-Ukrainians lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they lived mostly in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , not in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> and also Russian, because in our town there lived a -- a great many, they were U-Ukrainians lived in our town and they lived mostly in the hills, not in the center of the town. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So they had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for them also and there were some children that preferred to go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They had a choice, to go either to that -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Was there a significant Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was about, I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about 12,000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Was there harmony between Jews and non-Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , would you say, before the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Th-Th-The Czechs were very liberal and we had no anti-Semitism as far as the Czechs were concerned, but the Ukrainians were anti-Semitic, however they had absolutely no power, because they were not in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The Czech government was in power, so there was, I would say there was pretty much what you would say, harmony. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We were not usually great, I mean we did not socialize a lot, but on -- just on friendly basis, to say hello. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But it - somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also, you know, they did not care too much for education, where we are very education minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So there would have been also a gap, as far as on an intellectual level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Did that change -- did the harmony between Jews and non-Jews change after the Hungarian occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  It -- as soon as the Hungarian occupied us, they implemented the same laws what the -- what the Nazis did. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So when they -- before -- before their occupation, the Ukrainian took over because the -- the Czechs had left, they -- they -- there was no Czech government any more and th-they -- so we were really in peril, because they were going to kill all the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And -- so we were really very glad when the Hungarians came in because we thought that they are much more civilized and much more organized government, but we found out very soon that this was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father was born in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he was only two years when we came -- when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> and he had Czech citizenships. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They took away our Czech citizenship and eventually, a few months later, when I went to Plata frip -- no, before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">As soon as the Hungarian came in -- I was 14 y- not even quite 14, but -- but close to 14 and I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course and I didn't even finish the eighth grade, because I was -- in the eighth grade it was like -- like here a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , because our level of education was always very, very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Let's say if you had high school in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , then it would be here -- like here two years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in -- in Czechoslovakia, then it would be here -- like here two years of college. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Because we -- this is how they taught, because we didn't have like <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and right by us -- right after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , you -- after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you could go into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Like my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They studied, one studied law, one studied a dentistry, but it was right after they finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They didn't have to go first four years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then four years to become a dentist or four years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and three years to become a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">From as soon as we graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you could go in right straight to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But then we -- I was -- all the Jewish children were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as soon as the Hungarian came in and we were sent out, they sent me -- we could not return to classes the next day, so -- so of course we had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So one day I went to play to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when I came back, m-my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open and my mother and my sister Mina were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we had three tenants in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they came to tell me that they were taken away by the police because they had no -- they took away their citizenship paper, so they were considered as aliens and -- and they -- and I ran to the police station, but my mother motioned to me I shouldn't come near, because she didn't want me to be arrested too. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And there was already my brother's friend, who was a lawyer and he came over to me an-and he told me -- he bent down with me and he told me I sh -- because I wanted to go right away with my mother, I was very attached to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Told me if I'll be on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I'll be able to -- to help more and -- and I -- by then I had a married sister, so I really had this -- who to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And -- an-and -- and so they will take th -- away and I remained alone, for the -- at the age of 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But eventually, my mother got and my sister, a six months extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And this 1s -- when they came back, we had to make plans to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> because in six months they would -- they were the only ones really to get that extension, all the other people that were arrested at that time, when my mother and sister, they were taken over the Polish border, after a few months being kept ch -- in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , after a few months being kept ch -- in jail. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And most of them got killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Before we go on with that, I wanted to ask about your -- y-you were the youngest of six - six children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  I was the youngest of six children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  And could you say -- tell the names of each of the -- of your brothers and sisters and just- just tell me one by one, what th-the fate of each was, and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [inaudible]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What the fate of each one was an-and their ages, relative to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  My -- my oldest sister, name was Fran. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Badushnee vas fragy. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">She had three children, ages five, eight and 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Her husband's name was Abraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They were all killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Because she had children and any woman -- all the women with children were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Her husband was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> until -- almost til the end, but about a couple of months before, they -- they drowned him in a barrel of water, which took a horrible ti -- which was a horrible death, even worse than -- than his family's deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">For some minor infraction which probably was -- was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They -- they were just killing people at random anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Sometimes they killed them just out of sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But maybe he -- I don't know, maybe h -- maybe he went out an-and he wasn't allowed to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or what-whatever, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The f -- the reason I don't know, but the people that came back had told me about his fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Was he in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  He was in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> but I -- a-at this point I don't even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This did not happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , this drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It happened in -- in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But it's so many years ago, I -- I really can't tell exactly in which camp it happened, but I was told by the people that had witnessed this terrible incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My -- my brother, Haim -- yeah my sister was approximately at the time when she was killed, 31 or 32 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My brother Haim, he was a dentist and he was first in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They took him -- the Hungarians took him away and he got sick and he was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they eventually, they burned down the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with all the patients and he was one among those patients, so he was burned alive in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And his wife, Shoshanna, she went -- she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> she went berserk and she had no children and she was young, she may have had a chance to live a little longer, but they killed her up-upon her ar-arrival because they -- they -- they saw that she wasn't normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But this happens in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so she was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  How old was Haim? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">How much older than you was he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Haim was older, 11 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And Menachim, who had a chance to also go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , before -- before -- he had been -- been -- because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , he was studying law, so he left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and he's older -- he was older 13 years than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So actually he and Parela, they're alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Parela is five years older and my sister Mina was -- 1s three years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  We were very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In fact my brother was almost to me -- he took over, actually, the duties of our father because I was only nine years old and my father had passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And he -- he arranged that eventually I was going to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> when I finish the eighth grade, because after eighth grade, you had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> because there was no higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So y-you had to go -- go to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for -- we called the <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> , which was you know, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he -- he was always bringing me presents and we were -- we were a very, very closeknit family and very devoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I will show you how devoted my brothers were, that Haim, he had also a chance to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because he was also, he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and after that he went on a hackshara, which was a -- you know, this was like a place where you were trained in -- in toiling the <span class="REGION">land</span> and -- and preparing yourself to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where you will be able to help build the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he had a -- and because he was a farshara, so he got a certificate to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but in-instead he c -- he -- and -- but he came to say good-bye to us and then he came, he decided not to leave because he thought he'll be able to help us and he didn't want to leave us alone, so he stayed and -- and this is why he paid with his life, because he wanted to help his mother and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  And it was Haim who you were saying was so helpful with -- with you, becoming like another father after your father had died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I-It -- It was Menachim and father, Menachim did also everything but in fact, Menachim all these years, was so unhappy because he felt that he should have been there for us and -- and I kept alway -- I always had to -- had to tell him that this was the greatest thing that could have happened, because if -- if not he would have also perhaps perished and this way at least we had a-another family member survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But he felt guilty all these years and he didn't know himself how -- how to help us after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My -- my brothers and sisters and my mother, they were the whole world to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">There was no better people on this earth that -- that I know, even -- for instance, Mina lives in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but we see each other twice a year, because I go there every year and when I come back, she -- I-I take her with me and we always -- 1-if-if one didn't have, we always shared everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">While my husband was alive, whatever he bought me and if -- if they couldn't afford, he would always buy for my sister, because he knew it meant so much for me to enjoy it if she had it also. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we remained like this, very devoted to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And therefore, I d-d -- by having my family killed, they really destroyed my life also, because even -- even when you live and when you and -- and when you have already everything, but we could never fully enjoy anything, because we -- we lost so much in our lives and -- and we could never -- you can never get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Can get back material things, but you simply cannot get back family and -- and it wasn't only the family, it was to -- to watch the terrible things that were done while we were incarcerated and to see people being killed so senselessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It -- it remains with you the rest of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The nightmares never go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The screams never fade in your mind and the nights are the ones that bring everything back to us, to all the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I think when I speak, I speak for all the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There isn't one survivor that 1s really a healthy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But we have always lived our li-life decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We never went out to murder just because we were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We never became -- be-became criminals, just because such criminal acts were done to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We brought our children up with values, with love and with respect for all humanity, for all races and because we know what it means to be a bigot. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And though it still today, much hasn't changed, there are people that have the audacity to deny that this ever happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We, as survivors can render them liars, because we are here as witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We are the proof of those atrocities that were committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And all our loved ones, they're not here to talk about it, but we are and though it is very painful for us to go back and to open our wounds, we're willing to do it, for the sake of future generations and history, so that our voices will be heard and those liars will be -- will be put to shame, that they can yet not even repent that was done to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Because these are the people that would do it all over again, so unless they are going to be somehow silenced and unless all of the generations that will come after us, will be able to prove with our testimonies that this really happened, there will be many books written that people eventually will believe it because how -- how -- how would they otherwise know what a w -- that it wasn't, that it was different than what they are reading to the books? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So I'm very pleased now that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are finally having programs and that they are teaching us, because for the first 35 years it was utter silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Nobody even knew anything about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And if somebody in the movies, the -- the books that were written, read by us, will vouch by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I-I remember that people would tell me that -- all weekend, it's too painful, we cannot go to see -- that's if they made the Holocaust movie or we cannot read those book, it -- it's -- it's makes us very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It would be very upsetting to me to hear that, because if we could go through what we did, what we had to go through, then can't you at least watch it, can't you at least familiarize yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We couldn't even talk about it because -- because it was so painful to us and because we had to rebuild our lives and because we wanted to have a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">As mu -- as much as we could have a normal life ourselves, but people don't even feel like to -- to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So finally, they have now <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust memorials</span> that -- that people can take their children to -- to show what -- what bessiality was conducted on human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And what can I add to this except that -- that we hope that this will never happen again and if you have any questions that would like, you should -- you should ask me and I will tell you, if you want to know about my -- my life after, then -- then I will tell you about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">All right with -- you got that and now I speak af -- about my life after -- after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  I have just a couple of more questions about -- just to clarify and -- and you -- you really- | thought your first testimony on the video tape was -- it was very clearly presented and you -- and you -- there are going to be gaps in this story of course, from your wartime experiences, but there were a couple of things that I wasn't sure that -- about and I wanted to ask you about now. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Y-You of course told the story about how you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , you were trying to find a way to help your sister out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , you thought -- had thought she was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and -- and you told the story of how you found her and how you were cheated out of your money and -- and -- and -- and so forth and that you found a lawyer who agreed to try to obtain her release. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I wasn't sure --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [inaudible]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  You mentioned in your video testimony that this lawyer was able to obtain your sister's release after six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And what I'm unclear about is, why at that point you remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  I had no paper -- I had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I could never go -- go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">My sister went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , to her children, she had -- she had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And by then her husband was -- was, not any more with her, they -- they took him to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he never came out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">This was the husband that was eventually killed so brutally wi -- that he was drowned in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But Is -- told mys -- but I went at night, I -- I went at night to my sister's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I -- I wrote this in fact, in my book and -- and we spend -- I spend there -- I arrived at night and I spend this of 24 hours and -- and left again, just -- just to see her once again and this was the last that I ever saw of my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I had to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because this was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I could, you know, lose myself where -- where -- where -- and I was -- I didn't even look my age, so I-I hoped that I was not going to be picked up and asked for papers, but once I-I did, I mean I was picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But somehow I managed to talk myself out, you know, but [inaudible] the papers and I'm going to -- I-I -- if you want me, I tell you this incident, but -- but if you want me to talk about something else, then -- then I'll talk about --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No, that's all -- that -- that made it clearer, I was just wondering about that one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Because I had no papers, I could never go back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I had to be there, by my -- and I was by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  I ima -- I think it's probably in your book, but it's not in your first -- in your video testimony, how it was that you met Joe, your fiancé and when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I -- all of us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , without paper, actually that -- hiding, but not like some people were hiding, you know 1-in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or were behind a <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was also hiding, but I had to - I could walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and if I would be, 1-if they would ask me for papers, I would be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But I still had to also look for some work, because I needed to live and to -- and to pay rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So first I -- I worked in many different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and then finally I got to work in -- I got a job in a dental laboratory, because while I -- when Menac -- when my brother Haim left and he was the one that helped us all along until -- until they took him away, he made arrangements for me and my mother to leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vimiritas</span> , which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and made arrangements where he used to send his dental work, in to that <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> <span class="BUILDING">dental laboratory</span> , because while I -- when Menac -- when my brother Haim left and he was the one that helped us all along until -- until they took him away, he made arrangements for me and my mother to leave for Vimiritas, which was a big city in Hungary and made arrangements where he used to send his dental work, in to that laboratory, that I should learn to become a dental technician, to be a-an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So I had a little idea, I had some idea about dental -- dental technician work. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I wasn't yet -- well, I mean I wasn't proficient in it, but I knew a little bit because I -- I only learned like eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And after that I had to leave f-for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , hoping that I can help my sister out of that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So I tried to find work in a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> , but for awhile I couldn't and eventually I did find work in a -- I was accepted in a <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> and my husband -- my fiancé, who eventually became my husband after the war, and to say good-bye to my mother, who lived with my sister and whose -- she also had no papers, but that's why she was not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , she was with my sister and was with Mina and she showed them my picture. [</span><span class="sentence" id="156">inaudible] this is my beautiful daughter and she is working in a <span class="BUILDING">dental laboratory</span> where [inaudible] because we were like distantly related like sixth cousins removed maybe, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But my mother knew his father and -- and anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So he came to look -- he looked me up and [inaudible] from my mother -- and he was a dental technician, so he worked in a <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> and -- and this is how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And eventually became engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  How long -- how long had you known him before you got engaged?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  I -- about -- close to a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He -- we worked in the same <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Was that coincidental that you ended up working --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, he left a much better paying job, because he w -- he was a full fledged dental technician and I was just so-so. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I didn't know that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So h-he left a better paying job to come to work in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I worked, only that he should be near me, because he fell in love with me very, you know, much sooner than I fell in love with him, because I was so homesick for my mother that all I could think is, you know, my mother, my sister, I -- I didn't pay that much attention yet, to boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Had you had plans at the time you got engaged, of when you would get married, or was it indefinite?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  No, we -- we -- we had planned t-to get married, but not before the war would be over, for it was something normal times. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But eventually the -- the Nazis came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because they felt that the Hungarians are not doing, ar-aren't doing enough against the Jews, that they're not sending them out quickly, I mean because porty somehow the -- the -- wasn't willing yet to -- to -- to send them out, to -- to take away their businesses and -- they did things to -- to the ones that didn't have papers, but the ones that were born there, they did not, they left them the businesses and they left them -- they let them stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Then the Nazis came in and they did [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And of course then I knew there was no way for me to -- to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So I wanted to be with my family, so this is why I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak, this is tape one, side B. You described in your video interview, returning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoost</span> and rejoining with your family there and that you were immediately put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  A few weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Would you describe a little bit more about th-those six weeks that you spent in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We were in once -- one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We were -- my family, my -- my sister, myself, my brother-in-law, their -- their baby and one more family and some slept on -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> because we didn't have enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , on -- and we were very crowded, we would get -- food was being -- there was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> -- I'm sorry -- and everybody also brought th-their own food, prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We had -- my mother made a lot of like toast, you know, they called it sweebark, what can stay and dried noodles and whatever we could -- that wasn't perishable and we brought it with us, so for awhile we still had our own food, and after that is -- there was from the -- I -- I can't remember exactly, h-how was th-the food situation, but somehow everybody still had something what -- what to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we would play with the children, we organized a -- like play groups and we -- we -- we tried to teach them Hebrew songs and we -- we would sing to them and -- and we would -- we would just -- th-there was no -- nothing cultural, because nobody had any -- we didn't have that -- too many books, a few toys that people would bring for their children or -- or children's books. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But we were hoping that -- everybody hoped that this will not last long and that eventually you know, we will all return to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Nobody really believed that we are going to be exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Everybody still hoped that, even when they -- when we heard that people were taken away, we thought that they were placed in, say a -- an -- they would say a campfire, you know on - in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or -- or that they were taken for work or -- nobody believed that this -- that this - in the 20th century, that they would really kill women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Because my sister had a chance to go in-into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I had a chance to go into hiding, but I didn't want to go into hiding with his -- my fiancé's family because I wanted to stay with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So he went back to his family and I stayed with my mother and my mother wanted very much I should go into hiding, because she was not -- I guess my mother did believe that may -- you know, come to -- to that -- that we may have -- not be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But we were too naive and too -- too optimistic to believe that this will -- can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So my sister didn't want to -- again, nobody wanted to leave each other and that's what -- why we stayed together and nobody went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And with a little child, would have been really impossible to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But for instance, my mother could have gone into hiding with me, with -- with my fiancé's family but she refused and I refused and in a way, we didn't -- I-I was glad I did- I didn't go into hiding because then I would have always had this, you know, I would have a guilty conscience, thinking that maybe if I would have been there, maybe I could have been of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And this way I know that there was nothing that anybody could do to help, not even for the closest and for the most loved one in the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Now my fiancé and his family did go into hiding and they hid also a lot of other families and the rabbi with his family, because my father-in-law was very wealthy and he gave a lot of money for the people, you know, that -- that hid him. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And then, they -- what they did is, eventually they -- they went to the authorities and -- and gave them out, after they had taken everything away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So -- so they were yet brutally beaten before they send them to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then -- and then they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So there was no -- even the ones that were -- were in hiding were not safe, that they would survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  And whose -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , were there -- were -- was anybody working during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Nobody was working, we were just really -- nobody was working and you really had nothing to do and we were just marking time. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And -- and this was really still my -- my happiest time while I was in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because I was with my mother, I was with my sister and -- and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I mean, not with my sister the one that was the three children, but with Mina, because we were not in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my sister was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were in as -- different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And so she was killed with all her children and my mother had a chance to save my sister by -- by taking h-her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And of course you never get over losing a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My sister didn't even want to live aft-after she eventually knew what happened to her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And she always made herself, she always thought that maybe mother would have survived, th-that mother got killed because of her, which that's not true because mother could have never survived, they would have taken her to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> even without her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But it -- the point is, sh -- I can't convince my sister because she is s-so determined to feel guilty about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And she was very, very sick and- and she could never have -- and the saddest part is that she could not have any more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">She had only that one child. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I loved my sister so much that I always told my husband that I'm going to have one child just for my sister, to give it away to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But of course, you know, til you don't have a child, until you're not a mother, y-you don't know that you really can -- cannot do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">That no mother can give a baby, a -- a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And it was not easy for me, I-I don't have my children, the three children by choice that they are 10 years apart, because I -- I was very sick and I-I-I couldn't have children and I -- I -- it's --when we came out, we were always very sick, my sister and me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  We'll talk more about that in a little while and I wanted to ask you before we -- we move on and I do -- I also have questions about Mina, but you mentioned that you family was very Orthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  D -- were you able to keep kosher through the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or how did -- what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , yes, but not -- but of course after that, not even -- I didn't even keep kosher after I got liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">One -- partly because of being re-rebellious about what happened, being very mad at God and -- and just not -- and also partly because we -- we were so hungry that we would eat anything, we were -- we starved for so many years and -- and -- and you -- you just ate whatever you could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But eventually I turned back to galichin which we will come to it if, you know, in my interview, I will -- I will explain why and how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  And you're -- du-during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did you also observe the Sabbath and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, because my mother was very religious, I would never have done anything to hurt my mother's feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I was even observant while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with-without my mother and even then I was so hungry, because I did -- I didn't have enough food and -- but I would never eat non-kosher, even there. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I-I ate just -- sometimes I lived only on bread and margarine and I would buy myself, for like five cents, a cookie, because I remembered my mother would say, “Don't eat sweets before dinner, because you won't have -- you won't be able to eat.” </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So I thought, “If I'll eat a cookie, I wouldn't be so hungry, because the sweet is going to -- to chase away my hunger.” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But unfortunately it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I was always so sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Why didn't I at least drink more water, because you know, we couldn't just drink water whenever we want a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We suffered a lot of thirst and -- and -- and I also would buy myself lot of clothes, then -- dapootib because I would tell myself, if I will be shabby, then I -- somebody will ask me for papers sooner, because I will be more obvious if I look shabby. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But -- so I would buy myself, rather -- let's say a skirt or -- or -- or whatever, something to wear or shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And -- and not food. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And then I was so sorry, why didn't I -- hadder, buy myself food and -- and not starve so many years already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But you know, when you are young, you want to look pretty and you rather not eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  So, let's go on then to -- we know how you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and what -- and the [indecipherable] story of your arrival and after you had been there, d -- were -- you described your -- your da -- your daily life a little bit, how you had gone first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and then you, after you had been there for maybe a few months, you were --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [inaudible] from May until end of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">May, June, July, August, September. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">October or -- or even November. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I think it was end of October, approximately, because I was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in -- in [inaudible] January, February, March. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Yeah, end of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I mean, I can be, you know, it-it's hard to remember the -- the exact date and -- and you -- you wanted me to describe h-how -- how I left --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Actually I wanted to know --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I remember standing in front the gas chambers [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, I wanted to know, while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, I wanted to know, while you were in Auschwitz, did you -- a little bit more about your daily existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Did you have to work at all while you were there or did you -- were you hiding most of the time because of the --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">No, that isn't -- wasn't -- no -- no -- y-you couldn't hide in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> your day started at 4:30, you were chased out of the -- we were thousand in one <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and 10 in each three layer <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We were standing say lappelle as soon as we got -- as we were chased out. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We didn't have to dress because everybody slept in that one dress we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We had only one dress and there was nothing under, we had no -- no panties, we had no slip, just that one dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">In that you slept, in -- in that you wore and eventually became infested with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Completely with lice and -- and this was eating you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So the min -- every minute that -- that you had free, when you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , you would take off your dress and you would try to -- to get the -- the -- the lice out, which was a futile job. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But we would stand for hours to be counted because to count -- there were 30 such <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they had to count 30,000 women, all women. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And if one was missing -- and if -- if she was missing, it was only that she went to the electrified wires, to kill herself, then -- then you would stand so long until they -- until they -- they found the corpse or they would think you know that somebody ran away, which was no -- no chance of running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">People only worked -- the ones that worked were either in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I wasn't lucky enough, you know, to be -- to be chosen to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , or they worked by -- which -- they -- that was called <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , where they sorted out the clothes and all the stuff that were brought in by the -- by the people that arrived on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , because everybody came with a suitcase of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">An- And some people had valuables still, I mean hidden, like I -- we had hidden in one bar of soap, large diamond earrings. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But we threw away the bar of soap, because when -- when we arrived and they took us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , you know, to be showered and we had to un-undress completely naked and they shaved us all over and -- and they said, if every -- you cannot have nothing with you -- you have to walk in just completely naked and you will not get back your clothes anyway, so I was afraid to have that cake of soap, so I threw away the soap right there and -- and I -- and I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But eventually, no they -- they took all these things and they were looking for, you know, for -- for valuables and people had sewn in and some had in clothes, sewn in something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So they had people working sorting out and -- and finding and also taking away the clothes, which was eventually shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So, this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And then some may have worked somewheres else, but -- but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> say lager, where I was, nobody was taken for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They were- always made selections, who each went straight to the gas chambers, or sometimes they did select, but you never knew what a t -- they selected to take for work deep into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , or sometimes they did select, but you never knew what a t -- they selected to take for work deep into Germany or whether you were selected to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , so the block avdest always told us, don't el -- volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">If you're taken, you're taken, you have no choice, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So we were told not to volunteer and we didn't volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But we always knew when they were taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , because then they t-taken the people th-that they were selected to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , they would make a ring, from the oneth of the remaned and this is how they took them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , nobody should get -- I'm sorry -- nobody should be able to run out from under that ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And it -- as you read probably in my book about that girl that ran out and -- ballerina that I wrote a b -- poem about a ballerina. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">She was beaten to death because she was -- she ran out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  You -- that -- that was the only question about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so now we'll jump o-over to when you were leaving and you -- you described being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , heading towards the ammunition factor-factory --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Sort of came to life in a way, where she had been --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [indecipherable], that's right, it was just like a miracle, because Mina was -- was in such a depression, she -- that she didn't want to eat and there, noth -- you killed yourself, I mean, to get -- to get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">People became completely dehumanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were called the two good sisters because we took care of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And others were stealing from each other, w-would eat up ea-each other's food. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And this never happened, you know, between me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I would -- I would force oo -- er -- mouth open and put in the margarine, you know, it -- it should melt because in order that she should have something in her and I would change my piece of roosh, because sometimes one get with the brudder roosh the one, I got margarine, but everybody wanted the roosh, not the margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I would go and change my roosh, which was such a, you know, big deal to receive that slice of cold cuts [inaudible] for a piece of margarine so that I should be able to give her my margarine plus her margarine, it should go down her, you know, it should melt and -- and she'll swallow it and she only wanted to go and kill herself on the electrified wires, so I-I always kept a tab, you know and always was able to talk her out of it and yet, when -- when I became so ill and you see, you were not allowed to talk to German -- to any Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You were not allowed to talk to an SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You -- he could kill you if you were only -- th-that was like hierarchy. </span><span

divulge if somebody was sick, because if you were sick, then you were not of any value that y-you could possibly still work. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Then they killed you anyway, you know, so nobody would be divulging to an SS that somebody is sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They -- they, this was always the biggest -- the biggest worry of -- for each of the prisoners not to be sick and if you were sick, you never admitted that you were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">If you were dying, you -- you came out to stand say lappelle. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Let's get to that later, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That's really an important part of your experience to discuss, 1s how -- how you discover what -- what people knew about what had been happening during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But before that, did that change in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mina</span> last, wh -- you -- I mean that was such a -- a turn around --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  As you describe, almost miraculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Did she really sustain that from then on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Sh-Sh-She -- She eventually became, you know, more or less like me, that -- that she was- that she -- they took her to work, so sh-she worked, just like me and -- and she was -- she was eating and, you know and she was -- she -- but she was much more fearful than me, I -- I was much more, you know, trying organize, organize meant there, a nicer work for stealing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">To steal, let's say, if -- if we went to dig out potatoes for the -- for the German -- for the Germans, for their <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , let's see, I would try -- before we left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , so everybody got a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Top o -- besides that one dress, we got a coat and my coat had a hood and that hood saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I -- we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I-I mean they took us -- that was done on Sunday because during the weekday they wouldn't waste the time that we should go to dig out potatoes for the <span class="INT_SPACE">German kitchen</span> , but on Sundays, that we shouldn't, God forbid, have it too easy and -- and to relax, so they would take us either to dig -- this was a vety -- everybody wanted to go to dig up potatoes because you saw that you had a chance, you know, to eat a potato or -- or to steal a potato and bring it in and we would eat it raw because this was no -- no problem, th-that we had to cook it, we thought this is the very delicious food. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So we went that Sunday to dig potatoes and I dug some potatoes and I took a few and I put it in the tip of my hood, not in -- in the pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Somehow I don't even know where my -- that I -- I was so smart to do that, not to put nothing in the pockets, but in the hood and it was cold, so it was okay, you know, nobody would think why I have the hood on. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And -- and Mina back me, “Don't do it,” because she was afraid, I shouldn't be caught and two other sisters took also some potatoes and they put them in the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They didn't have a hood, they had pocket, so -- so and -- I saw Mina so afraid, so I didn't even let her stand with me, I said, “You know what, you're not going to stay with me,” because I was afraid that she would keep looking at me and that -- that her looks and her fear shouldn't give me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So I told her I'll stay in the front and she'll stay in back -- in back of me with another, these other girls, because if she'll be in the front, she's going to turn around always. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So I didn't want all that should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So as we were going in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they started to search everybody's pocket and they came to those two girls who had pocket, who had potatoes in the pockets and they made her -- them throw out the potatoes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they beat them, they were already half dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They beat them so much that we never saw those girls again, I mean they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That -- they took then four girls, two girls had to take one by the foot and by -- by the head and -- and two other girls, to carry in those two sisters to their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and they were never seen again, they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And that -- but while I watched this, how they are beating them and the screams and I think okay, this 1s going to be now my finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Why didn't I -- I listen to Mina? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But they search my pocket, I -- I had nothing in the pockets and I came in with those potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">This made such an impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">First of all, we ate those potatoes and my sister said they taste like norts. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I said I -- they taste like apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And -- and -- and I even shared, you know, some with whoever was under -- under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and -- and I always wondered, because you completely lost the normalcy, why didn't we ever eat raw potato at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I made up my mind, I said to Mina, “You know when -- the first thing I'll do when I get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I will eat all the potatoes I can buy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Never even thought, you know, potatoes have to be cooked, I'm going to cook them first and eat them. “</span><span class="sentence" id="315">Mina, we will eat all the potatoes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It made such an impression on me that when they broke open already our -- our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to liberate us, you know, the partisans and they broke open the ledgers and everybody was running to the ledgers to get - to get salami and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I ran to that <span class="DLF">field</span> to dig out raw potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And Mina had sense enough, she ran and she brought a bread and a salami and she looked all over for me, she couldn't find me, but she thought about those potatoes and she came and she found me digging there, a whole bunch of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And she said, “Cecilie, we don't need those. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We have -- go and get -- get some --” I said, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I said, “ I don't budge from here til you don't help me bring in those potatoes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="322">She -- she helped me bring in those potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And by the time I came to those ledgers, nothing was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So luckily that she had a -- a bread and -- and I'm just saying that how our whole thinking -- how everything changed, from normal and to become -- t-to think differently, to taste -- our tastes were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Our -- our whole outlook of life was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I w -- I would tell Mina, the only thing that I wish if we are liberated is -- an-and I completely discounted everybody, only me and Mina, like nobody else exists any more, that we should have one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to ourselves, just me and you and have a radio -- for some reason I craved music. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And -- this was my biggest mission, that's all -- you know, I couldn't even think any more of the rest of the family, whether anybody is alive, because I never really, you know, thought that anybody 1s going -- lives and that we will -- I never thought that we will be a -- remain alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I thought -- I built somehow, a world for myself, just me and Mina in it and -- and some music and -- and -- and all the rest somehow, I never even thought any more about my fiancé, you know, like having -- like having aspirations, I want to become this or that or -- or -- or get married or -- or have children or -- just me and Mina to live and outlive our -- our lives, just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Ina <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by ourselves with music. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And of course, life goes on and all this changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Do different -- do foods, like potatoes bring back memories for you whenever you eat them now”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  No, no, this -- not. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Memories only that -- that never leave me 1s -- oh -- oh, what happened -- is a lot I-I cannot bring back. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">All this I-I know was just a certain hallucination. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I mean about being just two in a world. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And -- but I am -- but I am very glad that I -- Iam alive, because -- because there was a time that I -- I didn't want to live, even after -- after the- I mean I -- twice I attempted suicide, wanted to kill myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Because I-I just somehow couldn't -- vatmany become normal again. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I couldn't visualize my life without my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I- I-I miss them so much and -- and even my normal feelings, you know, that I was in love once with m -- with my fiancé, somehow everything was dead when I -- when I was liberated, there was n-no, I-I-I had no feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I didn't even know why I'm getting married, but I was getting married because we were engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">An-And I was even wondering whether- whether I will ever feel again, you know, have feelings of whether it's sex, or feelings of whether I -- whether I'll have any feelings of -- of love, whether I can -- can live it -- in this world again, that I can find any reason for living. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But then you -- I feel that I did accomplish a lot because I -- th-this way if I would die, there wouldn't be my children, my grandchildren, the names of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You don't make any contributions to -- to society. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">There is th -- y-you just somehow -- you stop be -- stop existing, my family would stop existing. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And this I never wanted it should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They were very, very important and somehow as each child that was born, I feel a n -- their name is -- is -- and then I call my -- my -- like, the last child that was born now, to my youngest son, she's named after my sister and after my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It 1s like -- like they're here again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And -- and I still -- I -- I was able to be somehow like a witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I was able to -- to write two books, I -- I was able to contribute something that I think 1s -- 1s worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I -- my children are wonderful human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They're all professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They -- they all, you know, they never heard me say that you have to hate anybody or -- or they, I mean what I feel is something else, but because to hate is self-destructive. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It's -- you -- it's self-destruction because if you love, then -- then you love only -- not only yourself, but you can love other people as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And to love is so much, you make the world so much better than to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But the damage that was done to us, I can't love everybody because there is a society that -- that does not deserve to be loved, even though, let's say they're children and it's not their fault, but somehow it wasn't -- we were children also once, and we didn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Our parents never did anything and we were s-so destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I mean, the thing is -- the destruction is, that though I -- I could afford everything, thank God, because my husband was, I mentioned, very successful and -- and we did a lot of traveling and we did a lot of, you know, charity and we -- we help a lot of people, my husband was very charitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But whatever I did, wherever we went, I could never fully enjoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I -- I remember we were in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and it was my anniversary and my daughter wanted to s -- help and came specially. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">She was already engaged, she was going to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And she came to celebrate my anniversary -- we're very close with my children- to celebrate my anniversary and to spend the vacation with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And we went in the very beautiful <span

smile but I can never really laugh, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Like I -- I envy people if they laugh ha ha, you know, really loud laugh, never in my life after, I could not, no matter -- no matter what joyful thing happened to my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And then came in a whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they spoke German, so they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">A whole -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">This is tape two, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I-I will tell you of incid-incident that how I can enjoy everything what is offered to me in life, because of what happened to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And ber -- back -- and also what happened to us, because then you'll see that -- that when you know, that all the fam -- most of your family was killed and -- and when you remember the screams of all those people that I watched being killed and beaten to death, you always tell yourself, “How can you enjoy now, you know, how can you have a good time?” </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Now here, what happened I -- I was with my husband in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and he wanted we should celebrate our anniversary and my daughter even joined me, she flew down to be with us, because we are very close to our children and she was engaged, she was getting married, so we thought she should have just one vacation still with us alone and as we were sitting and -- in that beautiful <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , right by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , a group of German people came in and -- and they were so happy and they were -- they were singing and they were -- and they were having such a good time and here I felt so sad in my -- and my heart was so heavy and they reminded me of the difference -- how my fam -- how -- how I feel and how my husband must feel and -- and after all what happened, how they are feeling, how -- wh-what a -- how -- how happy they are, how they can enjoy and how we cannot enjoy anything, even though we could have now everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And -- and I just couldn't even finish my meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I told my husband and my daughter I-I have to get out of here, because I-I have a headache and of course they knew right away that it's not a headache why I am getting out of there and my husband -- I made him just pay and leave the- the food there and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And as I was coming back to this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that we were staying and by the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> I went out and I just -- and I wrote a poem, because the only relief I would get when I would be very depressed and -- and would think of wh-what happened to my family, that I memorialize them in my poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And -- and I will have to read to you this poem I wrote in this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">resort place</span> , instead of enjoying it, this is what -- what -- how I felt and this is what I wrote. “</span><span class="sentence" id="374">Out of the Ashes.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="375">From our ashes, we'll rise up and cry out to the world, on our ashes you are treading and make you face your guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Our ashes will remind you of our gruesome past. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We will fill your pols with ashes and refuse to let you rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Our bones will make you oerswel, of our tortures they will tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">As your salty tears will flow, we'll strike back for every blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">By your children, you will be called to task. “</span><span class="sentence" id="381">Why did you kill them,” they will ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Your children will bear the shame, you the parents they shall blame. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We will tell them that we were human too. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We lived, we laughed and loved like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And rejoiced with our children in being a proud Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">For this we were slain. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">To kill us all became your goal, though our flesh was dying, you can not -- you could not kill our soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">When you burned us to ashes, a little spark was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The little spark rekindled into a great big flame, a great new generation out of it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">This new generation was sent forth to win our <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They fought for it bravely and build it up from sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">To this <span class="REGION">land</span> , our ashes were taken, put gently death to rest and our children walk proudly, for we have <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at last.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  That's -- it -- it -- it's such a victory, in a way to -- to write something like that, that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I -- I always, I wrote -- 1-1f I'm -- 1f I'm made a birthday for my children and my -- my family couldn't be there, I wrote a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">If my -- and at my first wedding that I made to my son and my family couldn't be there, I wrote a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">This is somehow, I think how it keep me sane. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The -- the outlet that I had in being able to -- to express myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And I -- I manage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  When did you start writing poetry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  I wrote poetry, yet -- wh-when -- the first poem I wrote is when they took my mother away. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That time I wrote in German -- in German and Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And then I wrote even poetry, I have a whole stack of German and Czech poems that I didn't have pencil and paper, but I composed it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And this actually saved my -- my life also. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I don't know whether you read about it in the book, because -- because the -- the block geldest, she considered me like a talented child. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I wasn't a child, but I looked like a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And -- and some -- and she knew that I write poetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I mean she never gave me a pencil and paper, but she would tell me that if I have a poem, I should come and tell it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And so -- so that when they would make the selections, you know, for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , eventually she would hide me. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">In one of the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , they had a whole big <span class="DLF">block</span> -- a <span class="DLF">block</span> is those <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> , you know an-and -- and but we were living, but they had one that they kept just for blankets, they would se -- collect those blankets and then ship them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So when they would come to select for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , the people that were already deteriorated and I would, by then already was a candidate, she would hide me under those blankets, me and my sister and when the selection would be over, she would get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So that's really how I -- she really is responsible for s-saving my life, not to be selected because of those -- because of poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But of course, eventually, when I knew English, I wrote down in English, because you cannot really translate poetry, it loses in translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It's only that when I wrote a book, I have that one -- one or two German poems, so I -- I just wrote a few lines that I -- in translation, but -- but this is -- these poems I wrote all after, you know, after I know better English and so I -- I -- and by each time, that made me very, very sad, [inaudible] I wrote a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">If I'm happy, I don't write. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">When I'm very sad --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  When you wrote that poem at the -- after the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> experience, did you share it with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Yeah, with my husband? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Oh, yeah, I sh -- I shared all the poems, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">In fact my -- my sister -- I never even h-had intentions of -- never even thought of publishing it, but my -- my s-sister, I always sent her the -- the poems so and so and my brother, so they -- they wanted to surprise me, so they ask me so -- so they had all my E-English poems and they wanted t- to publish them, they -- because it was published in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So nobody would publish nothing that I wanted to publish here, so -- and I -- so -- but they wanted to surprise me, but then they didn't want to surprise me because they thought in case I have something that I want to add, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So they let me know that they want to publish it and I -- that a -- I want to send them something. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So I was glad, because this way, I -- I wrote, you know, like wh-what I wanted to write, to add to it, about each member of the family, I -- I added and I still had a -- a couple of poems that -- that I added, because here it -- it gives just an outline abou-about my brother, you know, about each member of the family, I-I wrote something, so</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Will you go ahead and read for the -- for the tape, the title of your -- of your book? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">This one.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  This was -- this was published -- first it was published about 20 years ago, but since then it was published twi -- you know, what my sister and brother published, was not -- it -- it was a very rough publi-publishing, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was not by any particular publisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It -- it was somebody that had, I guess, a printing -- a printing int, they printed it up and put a cover on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But then somebody has seen th-the poems in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he asks permission to publish it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So thens he pulb-published it, you see, in 1988, no, in -- in 1985 and then he published -- he sold them all out and he published them again in 1988. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So it's -- it's 10 an- and -- and 13, you know, he publish it -- but -- but they were published already, like almost 20 years ago, the -- the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And he already since then published a few times more. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Cause he sells them all over, he sells them in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I just, sa -- I just have nothing o-out of this, in fact I buy m-my own books back from him, you know, when I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I buy and I give them to -- out to friends or -- or -- because I -- I didn't want to, you know, hear nobody was interested to publish it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I mean, he doesn't have th-the rights or anything, I -- I have the rights, but I-I didn't try, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Because once I -- I -- I send up a poem and they didn't even publish it, so -- or -- or I got back that it's too sad, something like that and after that I -- I wasn't in the mood even to -- to make an attempt. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So it's like -- it's this being read and being sold, I -- that this is not from what I want to make money anyway, so, you see, th-th -- from this I could have and I gave the royalties, in fact I -- I even gave a donation 10,000 dollars, to have it -- you know to help publish this book, because the --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You're talking now about “Sentenced to Live”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  “Sentenced to Live,” yes, because it was published by Olaf Kisibery in New York and - and I didn't have th-th-the money and -- and they were after me, they want to -- my book to publish and I -- because I -- I really was going to publish it with -- this was another publisher that -- that was interested and wouldn't have cost me nothing, but then I felt I want it in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and - and I didn't have th-th-the money and -- and they were after me, they want to -- my book to publish and I -- because I -- I really was going to publish it with -- this was another publisher that -- that was interested and wouldn't have cost me nothing, but then I felt I want it in a place that is -- has some -- some sentiment to me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They were only publishing books from Holocaust survivors and make -- I wasn't interested in the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I -- I gave them a donation and they published it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And then -- and -- and they closed out, they -- they actually -- the Holocaust Memorial in -- that <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> ifine -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , bought up there all the rights and all the -- the books and they started to sell them and being that we did have a contract like for royalties, I -- and they wanted to sell me, I-I wrote them a letter that they don't have to send me and I -- I am donating it, it's all theirs, they can keep the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So they always send me, just the end of the year, just to see how m -- how much they sold and their little touch about the, you know, the amount that they are selling. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And now they wrote me that they don't have any more, that they're thinking of ra -- and even from them, when I order, I-I pay my own books, and because | -- I want to -- there should be enough left, you know, if it's not going to be ever printed again, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I -- children, grandchildren and their grandchildren, let them have.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  I'd like to jump around with that one a little bit, too an-and talk a little later while sticking with the chronology about your experience of writing the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But first let's -- we- we were talking about -- y-you had told me a little bit about your -- your transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we do have that story on -- on the first tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And we know that you -- you were transported to a munitions factory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> in Nuremberg.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  [inaudible] to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hallechin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hallechin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  That was Sudetenkabete. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That was Sudetenkabete, you know, that was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And this is where --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And then you were liberated there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  This is where we were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Why don't you describe that day that -- that you were liberated by the Russian partisans yer. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What -- what did they look like, what did you see, what did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We were locked in, in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we didn't know why, because usually they would come every morning and they would t-take us out, even though the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> were already bombed and they didn't have any work for us, but they would take us either to dig ditches, or to clear rubble, take from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> big snowstorm, another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , only that, you know, that we should be doing something which 1s -- which is very hard wh -- especially when you are in such weakened conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">What -- this was another part of -- another way of -- to torture us. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So -- and w-we had no idea why we were locked in, why they didn't come for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Everybody was very apprehensive, but you know, whatever will be, will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Nobody knew what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">What they did is they -- they were running away because the -- the British were supposed to come and liberate us, but that was still three days away and they knew that they h-have time, you know, still to -- to accomplish what they want, which was -- there were three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> of which we were unaware, we only knew about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> about the Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Jewish, a Polish and a French. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they were going that night, when we were -- th-that morning when they locked us in, they already left their -- their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and they were already in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But, at the -- you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , from where th-they were going to run away, but they came back to eat lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And in the evening, they -- they had planned to burn down our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , with -- with us, with -- with all our --the -- with all those living, th-those three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So what they did is, they had surrounded each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with wooden logs and soaked them with a certain lighting fluid. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And- and they came and they were going to do that in the -- at night -- in the evening and then run away completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So, but they came back to eat lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Meantime, one of the -- somebody send word to the partisans, th-that this 1s going to happen, somebody that knew their plan, which was, we understand, one of the women SS, she was from Czech -- she was like a mixed marriage, from Czech and German parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Either she wanted to save us, or save herself, that I-I -- we will never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But she had betrayed this plan and therefore the partisans couldn't -- didn't want to wait for the, you know, so the partisan surprised them while eating lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They took all the SS, they -- they -- they broke open our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they broke open the ledgers. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">When they broke open our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they showed us how our -- what -- what the plan was, it was still smelling from that fluid that they were going to commit this murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">In fact, they even said that whoever wants, can go and do whatever they want -- whatever we want to those SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Some went and -- and cut their hairs off, you know, but I -- but I -- I told you what I did, I ran to the -- to -- for the -- for the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And -- and we had -- one girl was dead because she got killed just a day before from the bo -- from a bomb, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And as they were taking us already to -- to that rubble and they started to -- the bombs started to -- to fell, so they told us, everybody should drop to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We all dropped to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and when we got up, this one girl was dead, she was maybe 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So we had a dead body in our -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So we first asked them, you know -- well, first of all when they came, you can't imagine what we -- we -- first we got scared, we didn't- you know, they didn't have regular uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">One had a green jacket an-and black pants and one had just civilian clothes and -- and one had an army coat and one had -- th-they -- they weren't like a -- an -- an -- an army, but then they started to speak Russian, you know and -- and th-they couldn't -- th-they were absolutely shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Everybody was so excited and crying and -- and we first asked, you know, we want to give her a burial, so we first -- we buried her right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">In -- in -- in that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And they told us that they have to -- to leave, they are taking with them, the -- those -- some they killed, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">No, I don't think - know whether they didn't kill all, but I da -- I don't know what happened to them and I couldn't care less wh--what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But we were afraid they should leave and we started to beg them, “Don't leave us, but maybe there are some still hidden in the -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they could come and -- and hurt us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So they said, “Don't be afraid, we -- the -- the French camver all man,” this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They are leaving arms with the French and they will guard ours and the -- the women's c -- the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camps</span> and in a few days they told us, the British will come and liberate us, you know, formally. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And -- and th- this is what really happen -- how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So those few days we had what to eat because they broke open the ledger and I certain -- had enough potatoes to last me for -- for a -- for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And -- and then when the -- when the British came, they put up a regular <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they -- they made those regular meals, but we were so -- without any discipline and without any, you know and -- and in such fear, all this, that we -- that we will not have what to eat, it was so imbedded in -- in our minds, that when we would come to -- to the meal, everybody would take -- would want to take the bowl with them, because this was a very important tool, cause we were afraid that we are not going to have that bowl and -- because this how it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , if you didn't have that one cup that they gave us, then y-you would have been starved, because you wouldn't even get that -- that one, you know, the meal without the one -- the soup what we were getting once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So we would all take it out the bowl, because we thought that we are hungry, we will go in now, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to ask for food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And they would beg us, they would say, “You have to leave,” yeah, th-the spoon, we would take everything with us. “</span><span class="sentence" id="500">You must leave it -- because if not, you're coming back tomorrow, we won't have what -- what to give you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Nobody listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It was like talking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So what they would do, they would station themselves in the front and like for children, they would say any more, anything, don't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Because they knew we are taking it, they would take away from us, the -- take it away and that was a repeat, every single day, until we got used to, know -- you know, until we saw that we getting normal, three -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Yeah, they would always beg us, “Don't go out and eat, you know, anything else,” because -- because our bodies were in such a state, that by eating too much or -- y-you would get sick and you could die, because our resistance was so low. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We had people that died because they -- they went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or went you know an-and got food that was -- that they shouldn't have eaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">An-and they got sick an-and died. “</span><span class="sentence" id="508">Just eat what we give you, we give you nourishing food and -- and you will always have enough, you know and we cannot give you a lot at one time, but -- but as you build, you're going to be built up and you're going to stay here as -- as long as you need to be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Because nobody was in any traveling condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We stayed there at least four weeks, until we could travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And then everybody got a -- like a voucher, you know and it was what -- we could travel free and everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And everybody wanted to go back to look for some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Our destination was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , because this is where I was last and we had made up with my mother and you know, with -- with fam -- with the family that whoever survives, we should go and look for each other in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But -- but we -- I-I never g-got actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I-I mean I eventually got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but what happened is that when we were -- when we went back, already after the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a-after we were already able to travel and we got some -- they gave us also some money to -- to have, you know, like if you want to buy yourself a drink or -- or, you know, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So we -- we could travel free everywhere and we were -- me and my sister, we were going a-around away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> made a stop and the redcoats was giving out sandwiches, so I went down to take a sandwich from the redcoats for me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">My sister stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So it came over to me a -- a young man who recognized me and he -- everybody would come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to see whether, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would come in with -- with refugees, they would -- actually we weren't refugees, we were ex-prisoners, would come in, they would come an- and ask whether we have seen this one or that one, you know, to get information that somebody is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And -- and this young man came over and said, “Are you,” that I am Joe's fiancé, he recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="522">He said “Well,” he said, “Joe is here, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He's alive and he's in, it's called Harrick,” that was also where you went for recuper -- to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They had <span class="NPIP">places</span> for people to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He said that he -- he used to go every day to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but he stopped going because last time when he went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , he was told that -- that me and my sister, that we were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That -- because we were taken, we were really on the way to the gas chambers at one time, I mean before we went to the -- to the -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> at one time, I mean before we went to the -- to the -- to Nuremberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But th-they, th-th-the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> were full, so they --they didn't want to wait hours, so they had a transport to -- to take the next day, you know, for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So they made us switch, they took us for work and they took th-that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that was supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">That's why we remained alive, but whoever saw that -- that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , told them that we were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So my fiancé stopped going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So he told me that -- that I should -- that he's going to take me to where my fiancé, so of course I went there right away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mina</span> and told her we are not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , Joe is alive and he -- and he took us to where my fiancé was and this is where we stayed again, like four weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Do you remember the moment of being reunited with Joe?</span></p>

tuberculosis became worse, apparently from -- from giving birth, so they send me again to, you know, to -- to get well, but there they didn't have medications, they only, bed rest, you know and -- and fresh air in -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">high mountains</span> , so Mina was taking care of -- of Peter while I was away. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Then I came back and -- and eventually, my husband had here an uncle in the United States, so he sent him papers and -- and we came to the United States and my sister went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so he sent him papers and -- and we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and my sister went to Palestine, because we had there my brother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">In fact I also wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but my husband wanted to come here, because he said that here -- here the technical work is far -- far more advanced than in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and he wants to have this experience and -- and he has the only -- he has one uncle that he would like to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Meantime, we had a very, very bad beginning here, because when I came out, when we came back -- when we came here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , who -- who didn't have relatives? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There is a hires, you know, an organization that helped the refugees bring over and they took care of them until -- until they got a job and <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But if you got from a relative, then the papers, then they were responsible for you and you couldn't get any help from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And we -- we could not even though we had Czech money, but the Czech money had absolutely no value and we couldn't bring out nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">W-We came with -- wi -- that [indecipherable] -- we converted, we had 13 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Th-That was all our -- we -- we had stuff like clothing and you know, because, from working we -- we could buy that in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but we didn't have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So, with clothing what can you do and we had brought out crystals and things like that, but this has no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So when we arrived, we thought, you know, we're arriving and somebody's going to be waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And here, I don't speak English, my husband doesn't speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Yes, no was our vo-vocabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We s -- we spoke five other languages, but -- but not English. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So any -- then we arrived, this -- we happened to have an Italian tax -- taxi driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We have -- you look -- my uncle had five children, all married -- not even one came to -- to wait for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And when we arrived, we arrived on -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was -- that they ditched already, I mean that was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army ship</span> and they -- w-w -- it was their last journey, they -- they were not going to use it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">SO we were even, not together th-the whole time and my little boy, who was two years old, was -- got sick and he was sick the whole time on th -- he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> the whole time and a-a -- we were -- my husband was sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> on -- on -- in one bicabo hold, you know, it was just on the fl

other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">In -- in -- in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> was chickens, it was a-- a terrible journey and -- and we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> we had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was more than 24 hours and luckily we still had money for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , plus 13 dollars and when we ar-arrive to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , you know, wh- where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are arriving and we are looking for any of our relatives being to pick us up, nobody showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Nobody came t-to -- to wait for us, so we had to be two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- we had an address, uncle's address, so we took a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and this is an Italian guy and he doesn't speak and we don't speak Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And we give him, just we show him the -- the address and w-we- we looked a sight, was, you know, we were sitting up so many hours and tired and -- and the child is sick and -- and he comes with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , this is where my u -- where my uncle had a -- a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">That time that was in a very fancy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And -- and somebody and we ring, ring, no answer, so the neighbor, he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , the Italian guy knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she said, “No, the Kleins left for Florida, they're not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they w-we-went away for Florida.” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They know that we are arriving the next day, they get a cable, none of the children are waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">The -- his uncle picks himself up with his wife and leaves for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and -- an-and because he didn't want to be bothered with -- with -- wi-with refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">That is his nephew, his brother's son. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But he gives him the address of his son's office in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , he's a very rich man, I mean he was in -- he's a real estate ma -- th-the uncle, in real estate an-and he has an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and his son has an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> <span class="BUILDING">son's office</span> in Manhattan, he's a very rich man, I mean he was in -- he's a real estate ma -- th-the uncle, in real estate an-and he has an office in Manhattan and his son has an office. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So he gives him the number, I mean th-the address and here I'm only worrying, with those 13 dollars, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> -- how we going to pay this -- this tax1? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I was afraid what is going to be w-without -- with the, you know, how are we going to pay for all that? </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But he came to -- comes, takes us to th-the <span class="BUILDING">son's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The son has the keys from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , from the uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="BUILDING">uncle's house</span> because he left them, the keys, that we should move in the meantime there and hoping that by the time he comes, we'll be -- we'll disappear, we won't be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So -- and we -- th-th-the son gives us the key and tells the tax1, he paid the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and tells us that his father will -- lef-left us the keys and they will come and visit us in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Never even asked, “How are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="715">How was the trip?” </span><span class="sentence" id="716">H-How -- an- and we come, there is nothing to eat, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And we -- and we had those 13 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">This is -- this is with what I'm going to -- to live in an empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with -- with a sick child and with people that care so much, that never came even to -- to wait for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Did -- was there --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">You know, you arrive -- I remember that this was the worst -- one of the worst times aft-after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Th-Th-The complete disregard, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Because we were always so friendly, mine, w-we always helped so much, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We helped for -- for strangers, I'm telling you that three tenants lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , ever -- never to pay rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">My mother used to cook more food than -- than she needed to bring down to the tenants children because they were so poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And here, relatives, after losing everybody, I mean they were not ignorant, they know wh-what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They -- they know that the family was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They are not anxious to see, they are not interested to -- to see somebody an-and -- and cheer up those people, to know we are here for you, I'm glad you survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">That's why we couldn't talk about th-th-the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Who cared? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">If -- if relatives don't care? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So- so my husband also was absolutely -- he felt terrible for me more, because I -- I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I -- right away -- he told me, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">You wanted to, this is where you wanted to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I wanted to come where my family is. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">This is family? </span><span class="sentence" id="736">There must be silica, there must be a reason why my uncle left, maybe he's sick, maybe -- he was funny, he was an unusual, wonderful, good person, my husband and he still believed that there -- there 1s a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But eventually he even -- b-but now we are anyway in a situation that we don't even have -- have money w-we want to go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So he said, “D-Don't worry, I have a good trade and I will get a job,” and -- and he was trying, you know, to do his best to cheer me up, but then th-th-these -- these -- his children came and I had such -- I mean I never had felt any more animosity than -- than for this family, who could treat us so shabbily. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But there was another part of the family, th-that we just got to know that were very kind people, that were not, you know, th-they were not rich and they couldn't help us financially, but -- but they -- at least they were -- they -- they helped us, you know, with a nice word. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They would say, “Don't worry, every beginning is -- 1s very tough and -- and you'll see that everything will turn out good” But this whole other family, you know the -- all those children, they just came, saw us, good-bye and -- and left and here we are with those 13 dollars from that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So I would go and buy for us, for 25 cents, a lung, because that was the cheapest, so that I could buy for my child a lamb chop, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">For him I tried to buy an orange, a lambchops, you know, that -- that he should have what to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He was very sick, I have no money for doctor and my -- that other family that I told you that they were very nice and kind would come an-and -- and -- and visit us and -- and my husband was trying to get a job, but h-he couldn't -- 1-it was very hard to get that time a job as a dental technician and we cannot get nothing, you know, to the hires. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So there was another cousin that she -- she lived in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allentown</span> somewheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So -- no -- so-somewheres on -- in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And so she came once and she brought a big package of food an-and brought -- bought stuff and filled up my Fridgidaire. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And -- and helped us that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And th-then, m- my husband, no matter how he tried, he couldn't get a -- he couldn't get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So he s -- he was sure that when his uncle will come, he has connections, he will -- he will get him a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But as soon as -- as his uncle -- finally his uncle arrives and his uncle tells him, in no other terms, he said, “Well,” he said, “I thought by the time I'll come, that you will have moved out and that you will have a -- a job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I said, “Look,” I said, “Hitler wasn't kind enough to supply us with money, so -- and that we could move out,” I said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="752">And,” I says, “you send us papers, we had no way of getting, you know, of getting into the hires.” </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I said, “But we are not going to stay here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I told him and I called up the hires and I-I told them my situation and I told them, “Look, we haven't got wh-where to be, I have as -- m-my child is sick, we have no job, we haven't got where to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">You -- you helping for so many people, I want you to come through an-and help us also.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">They said, “Well, they're really responsible, but since your situation is that, you know, bad, then you have to -- if you sign that you are going -- that we can send you wherever we want, that you're not going to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is very difficult to get jobs and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">We have - we placed already too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It's easier for us to find you something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And if you sign that you're willing to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , then” -- because all along, because I had contacted them already and they said -- told me the same thing, but I -- but my husband said, “No, let's wait for the uncle,” he -- he wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Joe wanted very much to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , so I -- I said, just finally said, “I am going to sign anything they want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And -- and we left and we told them, “We sign, you can send us wherever you want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They gave us right away a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in -- in das <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , was a -- a very dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , but they had there all the refugees in -- in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they had a -- a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> for us and we could have three meals and -- but they -- before they -- so I signed, but then they said to me, “You know, you have to go to the doctor, because you need to be examined and you have to be in perfect condition and we send you, that you're healthy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And when I came to the doctor, the doctor gave the -- this -- t-told -- t-told -- g- gave the report that I have tuberculosis and that I have to be hospitalized, it is dangerous for- for my child and that I need to carrior test and I was positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">That I cannot be send no <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so they couldn't send me away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , so instead they -- they got me into a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> and of course my -- the worst nightmare was for me that now I have to leave my child, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And he has to be placed, he had to be placed in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  Let's pause here for a minute and I have some questions about the -- about even before you actually took your trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you mentioned your -- what year was Peter born, your son?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  He was born December 28th, 1946 and we came in 1948, on his second birthday, December 28th, 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He was exactly two years when we arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  You mentioned about right when the war ended, you were in a state of mind where you -- you couldn't imagine the future and you just wanted to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with your sister and -- and you weren't thinking about marriage and you weren't thinking about children and family and the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And then you were also describing how you felt a -- a little numb during your wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Was there a decision made in having a child, or did that just sort of happen to you also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  [inaudible], no I was very inexperienced and I didn't, you know, think of that there was such a thing of -- of using birth control, because at the time I really -- I -- I wasn't really -- I didn't know really how to be yet, a good mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I was -- not only was I too young, because I was young, I was 20 when I married and I was -- and I was 21 when I had my -- my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And -- and I-I was not yet -- I didn't have enough yet, life experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I mean, that -- that I should know to be a -- to be a careful mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">My lot was that Mina had already a child, so she bathed the child, she -- she -- she handled him. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I was afraid t -- I let her do everything and she was very happy to do everything for the child because she missed so much her child that she sort of -- she almost had a nervous breakdown when I left with my child, because it was like taking away her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Her husband had to -- to put away -- to hide all the pictures because sh-she didn't stop crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">She'd stop -- didn't stop crying for me also, but even more for -- for Peter. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Peter didn't even know wh-who's the mother, he had two mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I was the one to -- to dress him up nice and to go with him for a walk and she was the one, you know, to -- to nurture him, to -- to give him the best, to feed him, to, you know, t-to do the things that -- that the mother is -- is supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">To play with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I brought him one day and - and I left him because I also saw that she has so much, you know, she comes so much alive when she is doing that for Peter. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Because also, when she moved away, eventually my brother-in-law got, after another dentist, a very nice -- for himself, an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> th-that he didn't have to work for the -- you know, for the socialized, he could do private work for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And so they had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a -- with an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and it was a -- a couple of miles away, a few miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So my sister always asked me for her -- for Peter and I would always let -- like really he was more w-with my sister an-an-an-and I was -- my -- my husband liked very much to go to -- to those soccer games, you know, there -- it was a big sport and s-so I -- I always went with my husband, you know and I -- and I let her have him. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And then when he came back to me an-and then, of course, we took him always back. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">But then when I left, she was left with a very, you know, s-she was hurting a -- a lot for my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And -- and Peter didn't care either way, because Peter loved us both, he -- we were always both with him together. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But I'm just saying that I was not yet a really responsible mother, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">This came - this came later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But of course I loved my child, this was - to me this was a miracle when -- when he was born because you know, it was -- he was maybe w -- the first children born after -- after the -- the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So then, when -- when I had to -- this was a-an absolute nightmare, I-I couldn't -- I-I said to them, “No, I am not -- I'm not going no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I cannot -- I'm not going to leave my child, I have nobody to take care of.” </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They said, “Look, what do you want, you want,” you know, the doctor spoke to me and also th-the ones from hires. “</span><span class="sentence" id="796">If you love your child, you don't want your child to -- to get infected and -- and then he will get sick also. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">This way you will cure yourself and -- and we have <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So they -- they took me to see the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where he's going to be and that he will get used to it and -- and so when -- so we came to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I took him still the first time back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And they let him of course play and with toys and -- and with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And then I came back and then I-I -- I came the day that I had to leave and we went back to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to leave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And I remember there was one girl, that she -- she liked him very much, right from the beginning, a young girl that was helping with the -- with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And he was -- he was a very, very beautiful baby, he was very good- th-the baby, I-I mean he was two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He was very advanced, he spoke, but he -- he spoke only Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He didn't even know English yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And he -- she came with him to the -- there was like a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , you know and -- and I went back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I cried the whole way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then I -- I left for -- for the <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> and then Joe would always go, every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The only time -- they got him a job, they got for Joe a job in a <span class="BUILDING">dental laboratory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">He was making 35 dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And they got him, you know, so he moved out from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , he wasn't going to, you know, be a burden on them that they should still have to pay his food and <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , so --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  I think I say right. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And so -- so he had by somebody a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know and he could only visit Peter on one day a week, because -- then he came to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">One day he visit Peter and -- and one day me. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So after a few -- a couple of months, I am told that they're going to put him in a foster home and I didn't want -- I wanted -- I didn't want him to be changed because I thought that he is used to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with the children and there's this girl that she liked him so much and she -- Joe always told me about h-how this girl was always taking care of him and how much, how he follows her around that -- and -- and so I -- I was very apprehensive that he should be changed and get another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> and I didn't want -- I wanted -- I didn't want him to be changed because I thought that he is used to this home, with the children and there's this girl that she liked him so much and she -- Joe always told me about h-how this girl was always taking care of him and how much, how he follows her around that -- and -- and so I -- I was very apprehensive that he should be changed and get another home. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I don't know what kind of a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he's going to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Tis like -- like I had like a premonition you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So, but they tell -- they told me there was no way, th-th-they keep maximum two months in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">After that, child must be placed in a <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> , because it 1s a more normal atmosphere for the child and this is a <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> where they have already two or three other children, I think three. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And -- and they have a -- a dog and he will like the dog, you know they, they persuaded me -- and he will have fr-friends right away, these children are also foster children, because they don't have their own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And -- all right, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Then, Joe --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Let's pause, because the tapes -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning of Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This 1s a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">This is tape number three, side A. Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Before we go forward, I would like to know what your expectations were of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">You mentioned that you wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , partially because your family was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Did -- did you have ideas about what the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> would be like and hopes and fears about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  I -- I really didn't have any positive plan at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We just looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it is democracy, so that we will be able to bring up our children free of prejudice, where we will have all the rights to educate them, to -- so that they should be able to have their choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">These are -- were my expectations. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I wasn't afraid that my husband is not going to make a living, because he was very conscientious and ambitious and he was very smart and knowledgeable and I had all the confidence in him, so I had no special fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">My disappointments were these -- the way we were accepted here and the way we were here treated and -- and also I must say that as soon as anybody thought of -- of was that we are refugees, we were taken like we are -- we don't know anything, we are like from -- from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , that we have no idea of civilization, I mean some people would ask me -- when I went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , whether I have seen already something. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Or as soon as th-they heard an accent, they -- they really didn't -- didn't try to -- t-to be very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Th-They -- they were -- they did not like too much Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">This is what was my impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Until -- maybe I didn't meet the right people in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Eventually, I understood also that it was largely our fault too, that we felt excluded because we felt so different from -- from you people here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that you had such normal lives and -- and we had such different and difficult and -- and -- and sad lives, that we cannot -- we don't fit in to you, you know, into your company. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And that showed me many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">For example, when I had children and we went t-to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , you know, we had a <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span> and there were refugees, wi-with a accent like me, people always sticking together and American people would s-stick together and we could never -- we never had like a common ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I remember that once, which was absolutely very comical, because they would stage shows themselves, you know, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bungal -- colony</span> , so we had like a club there and they would stage shows and they -- and my husband was always a great participant, so -- and he had a very beautiful v-voice and my husband would be singing and -- a-and we tried really to participate, to be one of the crowd, we -- well accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But then -- and then once, they said, “You know, why should we all s-sit separate, so let's push all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So they push all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And what do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">On one <span class="NPIP">end</span> , all the refugees, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="843">All the ones with the -- wi -- that are from Europe and on the other, all -- all the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And something else, eventually more Americans would go away, you know, more European came in and then, like five, six years later, it was mostly, practically, hardly any American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Because you had more in common, the American people had more in common with the American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">The European people had more in common with the European people. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We somehow, you know, if we are in -- in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you just look at an- another one and you know exactly what his life has been, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">It is like -- like a-an open book. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">We pretend very much to be like you, but it -- it isn't, it can never -- it can never happen again, not in our lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">When -- when I had -- when I came back from the <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> , f-first I wanted just to continue with the <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> because this I fear -- find was a very important and very terrible part of my life, here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but when they put Peter in that <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> , all those children were mistreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They were undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They treated the dogs very well, but my child was very, very badly treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I only found out when I c -- after a w -- awhile, when I got better, they would give me like a pass to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekend and Joe would go, of course, to -- to visit Peter and take him out for the day and he couldn't notice anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Because he would take the child out, he wasn't going to spend with him in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But when we took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekend, as part of an activity that, you know, as you get better, they want you to s -- because we are a lot 1-in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and they want you should start getting used to normal life again, so -- this was already after I had been there a year, so then I came back -- when I s -- came out for the weekend, we took Peter <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he was filthy, like he would never have a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and he was all scratched up and he had temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So when I -- so of course I bathed him and I put on clean clothe -- underwear and when I came back and -- and told that woman, I said that, “He's got temperature, would you please put him to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="857">She tells me, “I'm not going to go up and -- and down th-the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">He had temperature before and it goes away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Th-This 1s what her answer was. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And also when I came there, his -- he had curly hair, his hair was so n -- you know, in knots that -- that she didn't even make an attempt, you know, to have him nicely combed, washed, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So when I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> , I was very upset, I -- I -- of course I had no choice but to leave him there, I went to the social worker and I told her I want him changed, I -- by no way do I let him stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">If he is not changed, then I have no choice but to -- but to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- and take care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They didn't want me to, you know, to throw away th-the opportunity to cure myself, so she -- she told me that they're going to investigate and -- and they did investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">First -- first of course, the social worker said she came, she couldn't find nothing, that the other woman told her I must be jealous of her, that she's taking away the love of my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I said, “All I want is that somebody should love him while I can't be with him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And -- and I insisted on him being changed, so then -- then they changed not only Peter, then they send somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I told her, I said -- she said -- “The social worker doesn't think so,” I said, “The social worker is not going to think so, because she placed him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You send somebody else, that didn't place him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Then, let them find out how well they're taken care of.” </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And that's what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">They found that all the children were undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">They -- mal -- malnutrition, they were mal -- malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They took away all the children from her and they placed each child in different <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and that time, his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a much better one. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And -- and then I came -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , after I was there a year and a half, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I took my child back and my child -- this is only how I -- and I know it -- saw it there that I'm very different because when everybody else would -- were telling joke and would laugh and I couldn't laugh, I couldn't even crack a smile and they would all -- and nobody knew what, you know, about my -- my experiences, so they would always tell me, “Why -- this is -- was a joke, why don't you laugh? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Why are you always so serious?” </span><span class="sentence" id="876">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And I -- and I di-didn't respond too much to -- to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I-I would also suffer a lie because they would have, you know, grandmothers come to visit them and -- and they would tell all the jokes from their children and -- and I -- and there was nobody, bu-but the joke wouldn't, you know, there was nobody telling me how well my child is doing and I would always listen to them, thinking, what Peter is -- must be doing already now, because y-you know, if -- if they would say how clever they are and I would think about my child, that I am missing all this, I don't know his progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So it made me very, very sad, but what I did know -- the people shouldn't even talk to me, so I took a dictionary, Joe bought me a dictionary in Czech and in English and I studied language. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So that within eight months I -- that I was there, I spoke, I -- I read and I could write English, you know, so--</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What language did you speak when you arrived to -- with Joe's relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  They spoke Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Joe's relatives were Jewish and with my child Czech, he knew only Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But a child learns quickly, I -- you know, within a few months, within two months, he -- he probably spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I know he -- the Czech he forgot completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So w-w-when I came back and my -- my child would play with other children, you know and then when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he would say to me, “Mommy, why don't you smile like Edie's mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Mommy, are you going to die?” </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Because h-he knew already, you know, that I -- I was sick and I would tell him, “Of course not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And then I made up my mind that I want to be like all the mommies here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I'm going to smile, I'm going to do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I'm going to -- to -- I started to go to a -- a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Everything was arranged because we had no -- no means, you know, no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I-It was arranged through this hires, they got me -- they wanted me a long time ago, but you know, I-I wasn't ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I always thought to myself, I have to see guy and he's going to give me back my family? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">A psychiatrist, you go, you don't know why you are or how you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I knew why I am the way I am and so what 1s he going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He can't replace nobody and he can't help me much and- and therefore I didn't believe too much in psychiatry. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But I thought to myself, for my child's sake, you know, I've got to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I want to -- want to be able to do everything -- I-I right away I-learned everything, s-so that I-I should be able to do with my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I mean I used to ice skate when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I-I went back t-to, I went to -- I couldn't go t-to night classes because he was little and we had no money like for babysitters, so -- but as soon as I could, I take courses, I would -- I learned how to -- I-I would take him <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , to -- to -- to those, sometimes the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> gave a -- a -- a children's show and sometimes <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> was something and I occupied myself a lot with this -- my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But e1-eight months later I -- I had a -- a relapse an-and I had to go back and this 1s when -- this is my -- my first impulse w-was this is when I thought of suicide, because I didn't want to have to leave my child again, I didn't want he should have to -- to be in foster homes, I didn't want -- I didn't know how many times I'm going to be up and down -- in and out of <span class="BUILDING">sanatoriums</span> <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span> , I didn't want -- I didn't know how many times I'm going to be up and down -- in and out of sanatoriums. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And I thought this way, you know, he's young, Joe is young, he could remarry, he will have one mother and someone who du -- that can laugh and be cheery and - and -- and my husband was absolutely, he was an unusual, wonderful, fabulous person and h-he was, oh, he was always the first one to -- to -- to be, when the -- you know, when the visiting was. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">He w-would always buy me presents even though he didn't have -- he would live on -- on bread and margarine always, to bring me something nice, you know, just t-to cheer me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And he'd always tell me how great Peter was doing, bring me all his pictures and -- and always smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">He -- he was never a down person, he -- how -- how he remained so -- I-I want to say perfect, I-I really don't know, but -- but -- but he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And -- an-and he was very, very much in love with me and if he alw -- and he was a person that could show a lot of love, because some people can love and not be able to show, but -- but his love really pulled me through and -- and so he -- he was always, you know, very hopeful and always told me -- always planned wh-what we are going to do and how we going to live our lives and how wonderful it's going to be when -- when I can get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So when -- when I had -- so he told me he's not going to go to a foster home any more, that he made arrangements like next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they were a family with two children and they say he can see him every single day when he comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and take him back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> any more, that he made arrangements like next house, they were a family with two children and they say he can see him every single day when he comes home from work and take him back to the house and I should -- so that there -- so I brought him there and -- and when I left him and -- and Peter was all so -- I remembered that h-he didn't cry when I left him, but -- but you could see that he -- 1-1t isn't because he's not going to miss me, but because he was like 1n shock also, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">With again being left, because I knew how he was afraid that I'm not -- going to die, you know, he asked me when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and now I'm going a-away again. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And this is when -- when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I asked the psychiatrist, I told him I can't sleep -- he sh -- he didn't have any, you know, he never suspected that I have anything in mind and I had sleeping pills from before and I told him I don't have any, he should prescribe new sleeping pills. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I took out a whole bunch of those sleeping pills, I took them -- I -- I prepared all of them, I had maybe 50 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And I thought I'll -- when I go to the <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> , I'm going to take them all and -- and I'll die. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And my husband brought me a very beautiful bed jacket and he wanted me -- not to give it to me here, he want when I'll open the suitcase I should be surprised, he always loved, you know, surprises. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And he -- and again and a beautiful letter he wrote me, you know, that I should have what to eat again and about his love for me and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And when he put it in and somehow, I don't know how -- how he looked where to put it, I guess he wanted to put it a little bit underneath, he found these pills. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And knew right away that in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> you don't need pills, you don't take any medication, because if you can't sleep they give you pills, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So he right away guessed my intentions, of course he took them upthay and -- and he was crying and he begged me not -- not to -- what- what kind of -- wh-what I would do to him and to the child and to my sisters and would I do that and -- and made me swear that I will never, you know, attempt anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And this is really an -- I -- tha-that's how I -- anyway, I went back and when I came -- but it didn't work out very well with that family, because they would take for instance, the children to the movies, they would leave him alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">They -- he didn't brush his teeth once, so she -- she brushed it that she made it bleed and -- and he was already old enough to tell Joe, so my sister Mina came to stay with him, her husband let her go and stay here so that she should take care of the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And she took -- took back Peter and she stayed here a whole year until I didn't come -- come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And then, I was still not -- not well enough, but they let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I-I -- I wanted so much to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but only if I don't take care of my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So my sister took him with her to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and -- by then he was already -- she enrolled him already in the first grade and so that I could still recuperate an-and not do anything and not -- to have complete peace and not always -- I was taking -- pneumothorax, you know, I had to go once a week for -- because my lung was collapsed and I took that -- I was still an outgoing patient fo-for three years after I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So they wanted I shouldn't have any stress and -- and we -- so, when was I told them that my sister would take him back, because he was so used to my sister, it made no difference to him whether it's me or my s -- my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And she was more than -- than willing to do that, so I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- and after that I -- after -- when it was vacation, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and stayed with my sister, visited with her, like three months and took back Peter and then we -- I -- I never had any more problems with tuberculosis after -- after the three years were up from this, you know, after they start pneumothorax, except that I would go -- go for thr -- for the checkups. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I went only for checkups. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And -- and I was very anxious to have lots of children, because to me somehow, it meant that every time a child is born, was like I'm bringing back somebody from, you know, from the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">It w -- it became -- 1t became to a point, it became an obsession. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">It wasn't any more just normal, because the doctor forbid me to have more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">He said that for my condition, I -- it's very bad, because I could -- I could get sick again and I have a child, I shouldn't have any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But I was so determined to have more children that -- that 1f we would travel in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , you know, and -- and I would travel with Joe in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I would always look into other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and I would see a few children, I would always count, I would say, “Let's see, there are three children, four children,” and I would say, “Joe, look, look, in that -- this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I thought that he can read my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">He say, “What's that, oh it's -- yeah, it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cadillac</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I said, “No, not what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> itis, four children, these people have four children, we have only one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He would say, “Look, we have one child, he is wonderful, he is beautiful, he is healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">If you want more children, we'll adopt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I said, “Never.” </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I said, “I will have m-my own children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And I would not use anything, making him think that I'm using, I should become pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I would become pregnant and maybe because I want it so much, I would lose -- I would lose my pregnancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">But then I would come to the doctor, he would say, “I -- didn't I tell you not to have any more children?” </span><span class="sentence" id="939">So I would say, which wasn't true, because we had -- at that time he wanted all religious, I didn't observe anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I said, “We are so religious, and in our religion, we're not allowed to --” You know, because he said, “Well, I give you a -- you ha - you have to use something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I said, “In our religion,” I said, “we can't use something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He said, “So you want to kill yourself?” </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I said, “It's up to God.” </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I -- all of a sudden I became a God's person. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I said -- he said, “Well, then let me -- you know,” he said, “I know your religion,” he said, “and your religion s-states that -- that if it's for the health of your mother, you're allowed t-to have an abortion.” </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I said, “No,” I said, “I am so religious that this <span class="NPIP">part</span> I don't -- I-I-I -- I don't agree, I'm not going to have any-anything killed,” I said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="947">All right,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And he was -- be very mad at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But then I would lose it. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And this happens three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Each time I lost my pregnancy, it -- sometimes as late as in the fifth and sixth months. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Then, with my second daughter, with my daughter that was eventually born, I stayed nine months in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I had a nurse come twice a week to give me injection, the doctor would give me -- to -- to -- to make the house calls, you know, the examinations in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And -- and this 1s how I -- how I carried her out and then I was very happy that I -- I have my daughter and I-I named her after my mother and -- and then Joe became -- established himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">He opened up his own <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> and he did very well financially and our children were doing well -- Peter was very -- doing very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we lived a very normal life, except that I was -- I was always very sad in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Whatever I did, the trips that we take - that we took, no matter where we went, it -- I could never enjoy it fully. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Because if -- if I even watched a show and -- and then I -- I would -- it would come in, like -- seeing my mother with her grandchild or -- or thinking about my brother [inaudible] that how -- how this must have been, what a terrible death this must been. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Always I spoiled everything myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Nobody did it for me, I did it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I don't know whether it was sort of like a -- like I have to punish myself, that I have now a good life or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But that's -- but that's how it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I can't explain it, I don't know whether everybody feels the same way, but this is -- I never spoke about it because I didn't want to upset my husband, he's trying so hard, you know, to give me everything and t-to have a wonderful life and -- and he would bring down the stars for me if he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And -- and yet, he always would ask me, “Why are you not happy? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Look, we -- you have every reason.” </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And -- and -- and logically, I had every reason, but I just, I-I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I would have such depressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Sometimes I would have depressions that I couldn't answer the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">My husband, poor man, h-had -- didn't have a-an easy life on account o-of me, because he was always so involved about my well being that he -- his whole mind revolved around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So I-I would get into depressions and I w -- I couldn't answer the phone, I-I couldn't take care of my children, I had already that time two children that -- and I had already what I wanted so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I couldn't see people, I -- an-and we went everywhere, to shows and to -- and I would go, I -- I -- and I would entertain and nobody would really know what -- ho -- what battle I-I am waging within myself, battle to live or to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I-I wrote a poem, “Depression,” I wrote a poem, I'm going to give you a book, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I -- I don't have too many any more, but -- but just -- it will give you an insight that what -- even though -- that we have everything, you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Financially, wonderful children and beautiful grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">That they -- my children are very close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">They're all professionals, my grandchildren are -- are lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">We have no drug addicts, I don't have to worry, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Yet, what happened has completely taken away the good life that I could have enjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It's -- a-and yet, I learned how to dance, I learned because -- I le -- I'm telling you, I learned everything, to play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , even to swim, which -- which I-I d-didn't know any of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I -- I always -- th-the only real enjoyment came always, only for my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">At their graduations, at their weddings, at their -- at their, you know, births of their children -- I -- I make it for my children always, very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Everybody tells me that's -- that's calling spoiled and I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">If I can give them a good life and I can see it, then I don't want to have to be dead that they should have -- that -- that I should help them with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I do all that while I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I do all that while I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I don't care th-that they are -- you know, that they are not saving like I would have liked them to, but if they are not, I -- I'd like -- I am glad that they have a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I am glad that they have everything what I didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I never told them, “You know, when I was young, this is what I did or what -- when I was your age d --.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I never -- I never put any guilt trips on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I always led them at their pace. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">When to call, how much to call, when to visit, how much to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I -- I -- I want them to know that when -- when -- when I die, they are not guilty of anything, they didn't have to do anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">All they have to do is, they should be happy and that makes me happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And -- and now that -- that they are -- that they are adults, they know, of course about everything, because even through reading, even through -- I used to speak in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , I used to speak in -- in <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">In fact, my children were so little that my daughter once -- and I never let them listen to the tapes -- that she -- after I spoke once in Queensborough Community College and -- and I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she was in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she took the tape -- because I taped, because I wanted the tape should go to <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> <span class="BUILDING">Queensborough Community College</span> and -- and I wasn't home and she was in my house, she took the tape -- because I taped, because I wanted the tape should go to libraries, you know, those audio tapes, like yo -- like you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And she was crying because she listened to this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And -- an-and one other incident is, when my daughter was in high school, her social worker called me and she told me, “You know Mrs. Klein, I had to call you because your daughter is very unhappy and -- and -- and I have to talk to you because she tells me that she 1 -- when she is <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , her social worker called me and she told me, “You know Mrs. Klein, I had to call you because your daughter is very unhappy and -- and -- and I have to talk to you because she tells me that she 1 -- when she is home, she always has to be happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">If soon she is not happy, then you are very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And she doesn't want to upset you so she -- she pretends to be happy, but she is not and she's upset why -- why you have to be upset if she is moody or -- or --.” </span><span class="sentence" id="999">So she tells me like this, “Haven't you ever been a teenager? </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Don't you know that teenagers, they have ups and downs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And then I was think to myself, “A teenager, think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I have never been a teenager.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Wh-When I was 14, my mother was in -- in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">When -- when she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we had to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I -- I -- I couldn't go -- go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for eight months, when my brother found us somewheres, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I had no friends, because I couldn't have friends, because I-I-I was always in hiding and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">When was I ever a teenager? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I -- I thought to myself, “I really am making my daughter crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I want something that nobody can -- can give me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And then she wanted to go t -- away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I right away said, “Yes, this is the best thing for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But she was with me on the phone, every single -- and I never told her, “Call me every day.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But she called me, she would tell me everything and we were so close, that -- an-and I don't -- and I -- and I never, you know, was holding on to my children that I shouldn't let them move away or -- or tell them, “Don't do skiing, you'll break a leg.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Or don't -- I want them to know everything, to learn everything and to have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And -- and a -- and that's why I never told -- talked to them when they were small and never, if my children would ask me, you know, “Where are my grandparents, because this one has grandparents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I would always say, “They are in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Because if I will say they are here, they would want to go to visit their <span class="DLF">grave</span> or something, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So this is how I had planned my life, this was my plan from the beginning, concerning my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And I think I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish, because they are wonderful people and they are very, also -- they have a lot of -- th-they are very sensitive people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Th-They are very -- people that will help anybody that needs -- my -- my oldest son is a dentist, he did for people so many jobs that he never charged a penny that couldn't afford. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And my youngest son is a lawyer, but unfortunately he's not working in law because he couldn't -- when he finished, the law profession was so overwhelmed with lawyers, he couldn't get a -- a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">He got a few very -- I mean very -- jobs that were very insignificant and h-he didn't like them and so -- so he's not working as a lawyer, but he -- he would give his shirt off, if he can help somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">If there was -- once a -- a woman by mistake called him, that she called somebody else, but his phone answered and that time he didn't even work and I was completely supporting him because he couldn't get a --a job as a lawyer, he was already that time a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And she is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and she wanted to go to -- her husband had left her and took the children and she wanted to go after her husband and she didn't have money and my h -- son's w -- this is -- son is religious and this is why, we'll come back -- why I became again religious and she's stranded and he asks -- he calls me right away back, he tells her to -- to wait by the phone, he's going to call me back and he tells me, “Mom, what shall I do, th-this lady is -- and it's Friday, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And he even talked to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , they said they don't want to get involved because, you know, she wasn't a religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">He went, picked her up, took her to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for -- for -- for the Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I told him I will return his money, h-he should buy her the ticket, wherever she wants to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He took her down to the, you know -- after Shabbat, he took her to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , bought her a ticket and sent her where she wanted to go for -- to, you know, after that husband and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Th-This is how far he would go out of his way to help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I'm just showing that my children are not at all selfish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">They are very aware of -- of being fortunate that th-they can help others and that I always told them and my mother told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And we would complain why the richer people -- and we weren't rich at all, that my mother is -- is not having any money -- income, you know, from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where -- where I needed, if I wanted something and she couldn't afford t-to buy it for me, we would say there are richer people, my mother always said, “You should always look off, but you can do not but one that doesn't do and -- and God will reward you and you should always be happy that you are the one in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> to help and that you don't need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And that it's not the other way around.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And this is how all my children are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So I'm very proud of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">QUESTION:  Why don't you say your daughter's name and when she was born and then your second son's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">My daughter's name is René and she was born September first, 19 -- 1956 -- 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">No, no -- 1956, 1956 because Peter was born in '46, it's always -- and my son David was born July ninth, his name is David and he was born in 1966.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  So exactly 10 years between each child? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And how did you -- di -- after René was born, were you immediately trying to have another child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  No, I was already very, you know, I -- I was already relaxed, I-I have at least two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">In fact, something th-that happened is that I was bleeding profusely after -- I had a hemorrhage after René, a few weeks later and they had to rush me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I almost died from loss of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And then -- it took me months to recuperate and then for some reason I didn't have, for ov -- almost -- almost -- more than nine years, I didn't have the period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So I thought that they did something, that the doctors did something internally from me, that I cannot have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So we -- we never watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And -- and 10 years later, I became pregnant and I was very happy, but the doctor said that this child -- you're not going to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">If -- if it works, it works and if not, not and it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And -- and he was born and this was one of the happiest days of my life and I even -- y-you will read in my book, I called it miracle baby and I-I wrote a poem about -- about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">QUESTION:  Do you want to -- to talk about your experience with religion now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">My -- we were -- I mean, tradition -- we -- we kept --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sorry, the tape's about to end, we might as well wait for the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning of Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  We were always traditional Jews, but not religious Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">We did keep holidays, an -- but we did not keep all the dietary laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">We did not keep the, you know that I traveled on -- on Shabbat when -- whoever is religious, does not do these things, but I always had a kosher home, but <span class="NPIP">outside</span> <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , but outside, I was not observing what I ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Then my husband -- w-we -- we had -- we moved a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in Great Neck and then we changed <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> and then we changed houses to -- to a nicer area in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> , because my husband wanted very much to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So we moved and -- and after, about -- we didn't even live there a year, my husband got cancer and -- and he didn't have very long to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">My son David, we -- was -- was already danear religious, because we sent my children, all of my children, we sent to religious school, like David went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , like David went to Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">My oldest son Peter went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> , but Peter didn't like Yeshiva and -- and didn't remain religious, he didn't keep anything, but we wanted to give our children the choice, that they should be able, if -- if they want to be religious and my husband went also to a Yeshiva when he was young and we wanted them to have the same education and then whatever they do with their, you know, whatever they do, we can't always control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">So my son David, he loved Yeshiva and he became religious right from the beginning, as soon as he started at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And this the -- full time day school, where they have both, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Half a year -- half a day is devoted to religion and a half a day is to secular studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And when my h-husband got very sick, my son David, he used to go to rabbi's, to -- you know, they should pr-pray for him and asked his -- ask-asked my son whether his parents are religious and he said, “They are not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So h-he told him that maybe God would help if -- if the parents became religious, Shomu Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Shomu Shabbat means that you keep -- you keep the Sabbath, you -- because there are degrees of religion -- there is very religious and very religious, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Amada religiouson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So when David came back, my husband was already very sick and -- and he wasn't going to -- and I told him not to bother my husband, you know, because if he's religious, on -- on the hol-holidays, not allowed to watch television, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I wanted him to be able to occupy, you know, not to think always about his sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So David told me what the rabbi said, and he said, “You know, why don't you become religious, maybe this will help Dad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And they are very, very close to their father and they loved him very much and -- and I loved him very much, but I knew there is no hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try to help his father -- to save his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">If he believes so much that -- in the rabbi's, that Hallechin is going to help his father, I didn't want that when Joe will die that David should ever think once, you know, if his mother would have become religious, maybe his father would have lived, or would have lived longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I told David, if -- if this will help your father, I'm going to become religious, I'm going to keep everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Unfortunately, I don't -- we have to be prepared, because I didn't want him to be so disappointed, because I knew what the score is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I said, “But I am going to -- you can rely on me, I'm promising you, I'll become religious.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And this is how it was, this is how I turn back to -- to observing the Sabbath and <span class="NPIP">outside</span> I don't eat, ever, a-anything that's not kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I-I travel a lot, even now, but I only eat always fish and you know, salad, baked potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Wherever we are, when we are not in a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And my son became always more and more religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">This is how -- how he 1s happy in his life and religion really helped a great deal for me, in a way -- that my son was religious because his father died when he just entered <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , it was his first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and though he wanted to go away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , but because his father died, so he didn't want me to be alone, so he stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he went to <span class="BUILDING">Queen's College</span> , instead of going away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And -- and he was the one, the strong one in the family when -- when this - when the de -- when my fa -- when my husband passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Because my daughter got sick after his death and my older son could not accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">David was the only one, the strong one and the one that -- that accepted it and that he always felt that there is a reason for everything, whatever God does and he was the one that could -- th-that could give courage to my other children and -- and he wrote such a beautiful letter to my daughter that she keeps it to this day, because he wrote her that, first of all he would -- he -- he believed that if somebody who 1s -- cries too much and -- an-and is mourning so much for a -- for a loved one, that his soul can't rest in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">This 1s how he believes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So he wrote, he told me once, “Mom, you loved Dad so much, then you have to want to give him also, peace 1n <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Y- You can't -- you have to accept and -- and you have to go on with your life and -- and -- and- and you cannot keep mourning all the day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">You must -- you must do that for Dad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I-I wish I could feel the same way my son feels, but -- but I don't, but I -- I observe whatever 1-1s possible, as far as I can observe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">But what he wrote to -- to my daughter is -- is- I really want to show his -- h-h-how a religious person can help others who are not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And he -- and how he can accept the unac -- the unacceptable, like it was unacceptable for my older children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He wrote her, to his sister, “Dear René, look how much more you had in life because of Daddy, than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Daddy was there for you when you graduated <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , he was at your college graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">When you was engaged, he was at your engagement and he -- you were married, he was at -- he was at your wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">When -- when you gave birth to your children, he was at their, you know, at their birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Now I -- Iam just -- I-I am just starting now <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">He's not going to be there when I graduate, he's not going to be there when I get married, he's not going to be there when I'll have my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And I accept because you cannot bring -- you cannot change what -- what God designate for each person, but Dad always told us --” and this is really what he told the family always, “I'm not afraid to die, I had a wonderful life and a wonderful marriage and -- and I -- ” he was 63 years old, “and after all, some people live 80 years and they have a miserable marriage or they have no children or they have children that are -- that are in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or th -- I had everything, I-I have no worries, no financial worries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I always -- I always was able to do everything that -- that I wanted for my family and with my family and you must accept that and I -- I'm accepting and I want you to accept.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And he reminded this to my daughter, and this was an 18 year old and -- and I would like to see which -- an 18 year old that is not religious would be
