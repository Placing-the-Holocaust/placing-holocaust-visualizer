<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None</p>
<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Not sure of the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">This is tape number one, side A. When your video interview ended, you summarized a little bit about what happened to you after your family came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">But I’d like to go back and talk a little bit more specifically about some of the things that happened to you and your parents and -- when you first arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And y-you mentioned in the -- in your interview that your father went into the mustard business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And tell me a little more about that, how did that come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, he and two other people, one, a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> who was actually an electrical engineer, and a man by the name of Rolf, who was a Polish refugee, decided that they had to do something and this was apparently available. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">At one time my father had a -- wa-was in something -- I won’t say -- s-say [indecipherable] but in the alcohol business --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  -- and in a vineg -- he had a vinegar factory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liublyana</span> <span class="BUILDING">vinegar factory</span> in Liublyana. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So, he had some notion of -- of this -- of a very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And so they were there, I think my father -- I’m not quite sure what year my father sold it out, but it was very traumatic for him, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And particularly negotiations with the union was quite funny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  So these three men pooled their money and bought an existing business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  They bought an existing business, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What did they call the mustard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  They actually made mustard for various well-known mustard firms, I -- I -- I can’t tell you -- I mean, there were various brands and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The thing was called Old Dutch mustard company. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And as I said, they -- they -- th-they -- I guess they got the labels and the -- and the -- the -- the -- what would you call them, the containers and so on and they did it for various companies that I don’t remember the name of, but they were certainly better known than the Old Dutch mustard, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And they did that for roughly how many years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Sic -- I’m trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Maybe five, maybe s-six, and -- I mean, my father bailed out very soon afterward, he couldn’t stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He couldn’t stand it, he also couldn’t stand driving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> daily, and so it was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did he go into another business after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  No, I think he mostly invested in real estate and by that time we had already gotten -- he -- he’d started working on -- on this project of getting -- getting the compensation from the Yugoslav government and so on, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  -- no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Can you explain that a little bit, the compensation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The royal Yugoslav government had deposited in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> a serious sum -- I mean a serious amount of gold, I guess it must have been ingots, or whatever you called gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And after awhile the Tito government wanted to -- wanted to get this gold back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> said yes, after you have compensated United States businesses that were there pre-war, and s-some of our -- an-and our citizens, American citizens whose -- whose property was nationalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And, as they had nationalized a number of things, number of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , number of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and so on [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We -- we were within this particular group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And this went on for several years and finally -- finally a lump sum came, and then I guess mostly he -- he -- he traveled a great deal, he -- actually he did the trip around the world with some friends, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And you were in this group of people because of the businesses that he had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Also my -- no --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Simply because, for instance my -- my -- my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which is right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , supposedly very historic, it was built by her great- grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In fact, this was built -- when this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was being built, Jews were still not allowed to have property, real estate property in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But by the time it was finished -- so it star -- it was built under the name of the architect, was a very famous architect by the name of Felbinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And by the time it had been -- so this was known for years it was a Felbinger house. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But by the time the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was completed, this law had been passed in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> an-and they could, you know --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  -- own the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  So this was extremely valuable property because it’s in the very center of the main square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and there’s a great deal of -- of -- of -- I mean, this 1s a small, this is a two story, very old pa -- I mean, <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But the back 1s very valuable, let’s say like something on Times Square, it -- just the main square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> , it -- just the main square in town and so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  -- just the <span class="REGION">land</span> itself is extremely valuable and there was another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the back and so -- so that was one of the things and also my father had -- had some -- ano -- some more real estate property in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and other odds and ends, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So he got involved in this compensation negotiation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes, ye -- well, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I mean, yes, he -- he did, I mean, he and a lawyer and so on, it took a great deal of time and cu -- and he had to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a great deal and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But this was done through a lawyer here who -- who -- whose name I don’t re-recall right now, but was an American lawyer who dealt with this and with numerous oth -- not too many, but other people who had arrived about the same time we did, and some a little earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Not many who arrived later, because first of all there was this cut-up -- cut off date and secondly we arrived just -- we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> from --from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> on the day that the -- the -- the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> was bombed, so you know, if we had been caught we would have been obviously in bad shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  An-And was your father successful in that? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Did he get his money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  It was serious money at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I don’t -- I -- I don’t remember what -- what the amount was, but it was a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And when -- when you were first in New York, you mentioned that you were doing some translating and some research at the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , you mentioned that you were doing some translating and some research at the library --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  -- when you met someone who was affiliated with broadcasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was the precursor to the VOA. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But can you talk a little bit about your life when you first came as a young person and -- and who were your friends and what did you do and- and were you happy to be there, were you -- you know, what -- what were your prospects? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What did you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes -- yes -- yes, I was very happy to be there because -- 1n a way, of course I was sad, because as soon as we started getting news of what was going on, it was very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But -- but there was a lot of hope still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There was a government in exile which was [indecipherable] that was in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and then came back into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We th -- both my brother and I thought this was really fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you call it, an <span class="BUILDING">apartment hotel</span> , it was da -- it was on 57" and Sixth. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was called The Salisbury, it was like two or three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , and a -- and of course, you know, they cleaned up and gave you the -- and gave you fresh laundry and so on and there were pa -- I think there were two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and some kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I remember going to a five and 10 cents store and we bought all of this crazy china, very cheap stuff, and like four plates and four spoons and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And it was sort of like playacting almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Nobody was aware of really what was going on and how it was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There was -- we knew, of course, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in Austria and Germany, but there was no talk of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , and there were none at that time, I don’t believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Also, at the same time, this gentleman who was in the mustard business with my father, who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , he -- they came -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There was a girl who was about, I don’t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a boy who was maybe a year or two younger than my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My mother didn’t have the faintest notion about cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This very nice Mrs. Shanser taught her to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">By that time we had moved to a nice furnished place in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riverdale</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Do you know where that is, across from [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No, I -- mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  -- but anyhow, it’s -- it’s almost on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scarsdale</span> and well, <span class="REGION">Westchester county</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And they had this very nice apartment building that had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> taking you to the -- to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> if you wanted it, several times a day, and to the little <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> that had a bus taking you to the -- to the subway if you wanted it, several times a day, and to the little grocery, to -- to shopping [indecipherable] was where my mother used to go with this friend who was teaching her how to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And however, when we got there, we discovered that there really -- we didn’t have enough knives and forks and we couldn’t function very well with whatever we had, these four spoons and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And that <span class="NPIP">place</span> did not have any tablecloth or any -- it - it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was quite nice, and it was large and quite pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So then my father went to an auction in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And this was a extremely sad thing that I’m still -- that is still terribly painful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He went to the New York docks, wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you call the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> <span class="DLF">New York docks</span> , wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you call the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of furniture, household goods?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Containers</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And for non-payment of fees at the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , these things were auctioned off. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So he didn’t really know what -- what was in it, but they would say, I don’t know, china and silverware and odds and ends and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he bought this almost sight unseen -- in fact, sight unseen stuff, which then was brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I still have it, but this -- now it’s going to go [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Very, very elaborate -- if you want I’Il show you the thing because it’s kind of amusing -- china, which was obviously bought by a family that was moving to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> with you know, what can we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we’re permitted to take out and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  So this is just a lot of gold and a lot -- I'll show it to you -- thing, which we used for everyday use. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I think we were cutting things and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean, our -- our china at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was very nice china, but it wasn’t elaborate, I mean was -- it was okay, it was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  -- It was a -- we -- we thought this was really fun, both my brother and I. And then one day -- there’s all sorts of stories about it -- one day somebody said, do you know how much this stuff is worth? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I said, absolutely no idea, I mean, this is what - yeah, this is what we use. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Although we thought it was quite funny that it was as -- as -- as elaborate as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So finally we decided okay, we need to do -- put this aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">However, later on we did use for slightly better stuff, slightly better occasions, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And one day -- by that time the government in exile had -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or some parts of 1t and were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And as ours was really just about the only family --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Intact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  -- intact, and you know, we didn’t live in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , all of these guys whose wives were left either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> and whatever, would congregate and come and have coffee with us and -- and kugelhupf and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And by -- I don’t know, this wasn’t at the time, yet maybe it was, that Albina Padovan had come from -- no, I’d -- I’m -- I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Anyhow, we were having, I remember as today, there were about five or six various ministers of one kind or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">One of them was the minister of -- of the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , who was a -- who -- who -- who had gone to the -- to a -- to a <span class="BUILDING">Franciscan seminary</span> , but who became the minister of, as I said, of the post -- of <span class="BUILDING">post offices</span> in th -- and was a friend, very close friend of my father’s from childhood days. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So he was there, and then there was a guy by the name of Gavrilovic who was a -- who was the Minister of Finance. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He hadn’t a been, but I’m -- I think he was pre-war, pre -- pre-war, I think he was the -- a congressman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That was Gavrilovic. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And there were several others. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And then there were some people, some refugees who had meanwhile come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> and -- via <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , which was another way that people were coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  And they got into -- and I had -- this was at the time when there was a particularly horrible story going on with Draza Mihailovic and -- and -- and -- and - and Tito. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And it was at the time when the Germans were killing every 10" child or every 10" male in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I remember coming back from work and they’re s-standing there and suddenly they got into a horrible fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">One was with a cake knife and the other had his -- had the -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , trying to ward off -- I -- I don’t remember who was doing what. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">One of them fainted, and my mother and I just disappeared into the maid’s room and locked ourselves up because we didn’t want to be part of this whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And in the process one -- one of the cups got broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So it’s not an absolute --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Perfect set.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  -- [indecipherable] set. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So -- so, you know, we must have been -- this wasn’t an unusual thing, they were there a lot of the time and so that necklace, one of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then when we opened this -- this case with the set -- with -- with -- they had between it, and I may still have some, little flannel dividers with embroidery, hand embroidery around tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  But I don’t even think -- this became heartbreaking later to me, th-this -- this was still all in the process, okay --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  -- so you know, maybe they’re somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We didn’t know yet what really was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Yeah, and did -- these men were coming -- you knew what was going on, because you were in touch with these people whose lives and livelihoods were very tied up with what was happening there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  So you were on the edge of --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Was it the assumption at that moment in time that you were gonna go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Was this a temporary situation for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  It was a temporary situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  It was so much a temporary situation that I actually thought when I was -- married Morris, that he was going back on his job and I was going with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then he had to resign and [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well, you’re jumping ahead a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  So your -- your -- your mother and father were assuming that we will maybe stay here --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
