<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Tell me about how your life changed when the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well, at the beginning when the Germans came into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , they let us for a while be in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , everything was like never nothing happened yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Then one summer morning, early morning, they knocked on everybody's <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and they made everybody get out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and who wouldn't leave, they shoot right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So they got us all out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and they started marching us, and right next to us, the Gentile people were marching with shovels. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now we couldn't understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Because nobody said nothing, and then we see the German soldiers walking, and make us march. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was divided by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was like a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So we marched over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and way out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like in a big <span class="DLF">field</span> and there were already Germans with the machine guns all around standing and we got in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they told us to sit down and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we sit there and we couldn't understand anything, nothing, and those people with the shovels, they probably went to dig ditches already to kill us or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Because it was the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, late afternoon, they told us women and children separate, men separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They started separating everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And there was one nice soldier, and he walked over and he says the women with the children will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That is all he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And we still didn't know what he meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So, by that time everybody who had three or four kids started dividing between the people who didn't have kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So then they marched the men away first. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And nobody knew where they had taken them and what they would do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Then 20 minutes later, they told all the women, "Line up and start marching towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So we were told to separate again, as soon as we cross, we got in the middle halfway in the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and they told us to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And everybody started to run into <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Whatever <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they saw, they just ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And right after we got into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , we could hear shooting and we more exactly, you know, understood that something was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And nobody knew where the men were or nothing until late evening they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They took them to <span class="BUILDING">armory</span> like, a armory for soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They took them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They made them work for awhile, and then they let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that was the first that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And right after that, they made a Judenrat--an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , where you have to register to go work. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They came there and they asked for people to work and everybody started working. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And they were young, young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had to wear first a Jewish star on our arm, like an arm band. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That was not good enough for them because they couldn't tell if you were Jew or not because the right arm band didn't show much. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So they told us to wear a yellow circle in the back of our back and in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I, myself, was not allowed to work, I had been going to work every day, and worked different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and once I was taken to work on a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> with some other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We had to carry small bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the SS were standing with the whips, and if you didn't pick it up and take it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you were whipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then, a few months later, they organized a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They took one part of the section and all the Jews went to this part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they put in like 2 or 3 families in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And they had a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and you had to go in through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and come out through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And then, one day they came, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , to mobilize all the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They never came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They always went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and then we have to come there and then go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So when I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , I said to myself, "I am not going." </span><span class="sentence" id="132">For some reason, I had a feeling that something was going to be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So I said "No, I am not going." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My mother didn't insist for me to go either. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">She says "You don't want to go, don't!." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So they had on the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , like an empty <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , was bombed, you know, and they came in, and I crawled in there and I sit in there, and I watched through the broken wood pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they were loading up as many as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They put one on top of another, and I knew that something was wrong, and those people never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We later found out they were taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And life was going on for awhile like that, and I was working different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Once they took a group of girls and three men to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , to make ready the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the soldiers who had to come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We had to put straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , clean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The men were chopping wood to make a fire, and one German was watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">One German was watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They never left us alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So after we finished, we told them we finished, and we free to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He said, "No, we have to stay and wait for the soldiers." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, I said, 'No, something is going to happen when the soldiers come in." </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So I say to the girls, "We have to run." </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They say, "How can we run, the soldiers here." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I said, "I get rid of them." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I told the men to come out for a minute and keep him busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I told him why and we could get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And while he was there, we run out and we run into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to the Judenrat, and we told the man what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So he put us in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and put a bookcase in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Because he was afraid, the German might come back, and sure enough he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He came looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And he says he never saw us, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> 1s big, and we might be wandering around in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He left, and when it got dark, we came out and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And that is how it went on for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then they organized us again and they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and they had a big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we had to stay there for a whole week to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Men, old men and girls, it doesn't matter what size. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And they had a Gentile woman prepare the soup, whatever they gave us, so one day when they served us the food, she said to me, "You know when you finish working here, they are going to blow up the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with you all. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I can help you get out if you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Tell everybody what is happening." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So that evening I told them that we had to get out because by tomorrow it might be the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Nobody wanted to listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They all were saying, "Ah, you just think so." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Nobody believed that that was going to happen, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So I told her that I am ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So she brought me a long skirt for summertime, and she bought me a shawl like the people from the farmers wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I got dressed, and she got me out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I started walking maybe 30 or 40 kilometers <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Took me a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And when I got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , my mother was shocked to see me; because she didn't expect me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">She asked me what happened, and I said that is what news we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And sure enough, they finished working that Friday; and sure enough, that Friday night, that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There is one person also escaped that day before the blow up, and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  The rest of them were all killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  The rest of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You see, before they even sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they got rid of people, as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And that went on until 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And by that time, everybody got a little smarter and understood what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So everybody made like <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> , wherever they can find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Like the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I lived, they made under the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They made an <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">You could not really get in too many people there, you know, just enough to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And one morning when we woke up, we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> right in front of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> along the <span class="DLF">street</span> , a lot of Germans, and we understood that something 1s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So we crawled into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we could hear stomping around in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , looking, and it was terrible that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We sit quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We didn't have food in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We didn't expect, you didn't know when they could do it, so you couldn't prepare yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So then, after a couple of days sitting in there, the water pipe broke, and the water started coming up, gushing out there, and was almost to our necks, and we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We couldn't stay no longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So we came out during the night, went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we changed the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We didn't think about nothing, just to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was Gentile people which my mother knew and she secured, we had to run, they will keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So we ran from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the front <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was closer to the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and we looked around, nobody was there, and we went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And my mother knocked on the <span class="DLF">back door</span> , and the man opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and he said if we not going to leave he is going to call the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He no want to see us and he doesn't know us. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, so next <span class="DLF">door</span> was another Gentile person who knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My mother went over there, and he says he can keep us overnight and during the day we will have to leave because it is right by the main <span class="DLF">road</span> and he really don't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So he had a big stack of hay in the middle of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Anybody could walk over and punch the hay and find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And we crawled in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He brought us some food and we sat the next day, all day, and the evening he bought us some clothes so we be looking like Gentile people, and we started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Where we were going we didn't know ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">My mother had in mind there was a woman living on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , maybe she will keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So we walked over to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and when we got to her <span class="NPIP">place</span> we heard German voices in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So we couldn't do nothing, so she had like a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> which she used to keep a pig in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We crawled in this little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and we sat there and waited until the Germans left. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">When the Germans left, my mother knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the woman said she is very sorry, she couldn't keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">She has no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and her daughter is dating those Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">She says "You can stay tonight if you want, and tomorrow maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So we stayed overnight and the next morning, early morning, my mother got up, she got dressed, and she left us there, and she went to look for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">She was gone all day, and in the evening she came, she says, "I find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She didn't know the person, the person didn't know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">She was a very nice Gentile woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">She believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">She said God sent us to her and she has to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">She was a poor woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And we came there, the next morning we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And the next morning she put us 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">She knew that we couldn't stay there because anybody who comes in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to work, because her husband was a forest man, and everybody had a piece of ground and worked in those <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She was afraid anybody come to the <span class="DLF">field</span> would see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So we were there for awhile and in Europe, they really make a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , big <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and they put potatoes and they keep them over winter there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She had potatoes in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So she took the potatoes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">She put some straw down and she put some boards over top. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">She put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pole</span> in the middle to hold it on and on top, she put in pumpkins, a whole bunch of pumpkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And she just made a small <span class="DLF">hole</span> so we could climb in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we went in there, it was in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We went in there, and we sit there for 16 months in that little <span class="DLF">hole</span> , 1n that little <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You couldn't even stretch your feet out. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she brought us food once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We had one potato, each of us a day, and a quart of water a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She, herself, didn't have much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She was glad to feed us with that, and we were happy to get this so long as we are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And some days when it was quiet she used to come take the pumpkin away so we can get some <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">One day she took the pumpkin away. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And we were sitting and talking between each other; and all of a sudden, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came by and threw the pumpkin on the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So I said to my father, I said, "Ah, I am going to open up. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I will push it." </span><span class="sentence" id="246">He said, "No, leave it along." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And right after that, two Germans passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It looked like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> knew...we...that we were there, and she has to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And we was there for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And the woman knew what was going on, because if they caught people at <span class="BUILDING">Gentile's houses</span> , they killed the Gentile and the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">She didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She just want to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She had one little boy, she had three kids, and one little kid was 4 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He used to go in the <span class="DLF">field</span> sometimes and get some carrots out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and bring them down to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He used to say, "The Germans will not live to long enough to kill you." </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He was very nice, the little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And we were there, and then one day, like she noticed it, she thought somebody saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It was wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She says we have to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And we went out of there, and we go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">On ice! </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We laid on that, and we had hardly any clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We laid all night on that ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Everybody, when I tell them, I tell them the story about this ice, they don't believe me and I didn't get pneumonia or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It looks like our bodies were so strong, they took anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we stayed overnight and the next morning, we went back in, and we stayed there until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In 1944, she, herself, used to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and bring us newspapers so we could read to her because she couldn't read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So in the evenings she used to bring a candle with the paper, and my father used to read the news to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And we told her if she goes into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , see what happens, if she talks to people, tell us what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So 1n that year of '44, she came back and said the people were talking the Russians were coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So it was good news, already the Germans were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So one day she came and she says, "The Germans are out. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was bombing and all that, and the Germans are out, and the Russians are back in." </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So my parents go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they left us still in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> because they were not sure what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They left to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And we were sitting there; and my sisters were giving me a hard time because they were upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I was upset myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And we could do nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And she didn't know where they were either. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So after a couple of days, there was a big snow and they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They came back, and they couldn't find us because the snow covered the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They knew where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, it was hard to find the <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we heard <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that somebody is walking around and like working with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We were afraid to say anything, because we didn't know really who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So at that time I said to my sisters, _______, "I think maybe they came for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Just don't cry, don't make noise." </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And at that time, I heard my mother's voice in Jewish--"Kids, we are here." </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Oh, when I heard that, I was in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , with horses, some comforters, down comforters, and clothes for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They threw down the clothes, and they pulled us out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We couldn't even stand up, so weak we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And the put us right on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And a doctor, gynecologist, a woman doctor, she took us into her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And my younger sister could hardly walk at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Another doctor took her in and kept her for awhile, to put her back on her feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we really had a hard time getting back on our feet because whatever food we ate didn't stay with us because we were not used to all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And there was a lot of nice Gentile people who came and brought us food and brought us everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then we started looking around, looked for our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So then we find another empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we moved in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And we stayed there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And then, in the fall, my mother adopted a boy who was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The way she adopted him, this gentlemen had him and had another little girl with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He knew my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He came over and asked we take him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">My mother right away said, "Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He is mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And we had a hard time with him, because he was so used to the Gentile person he didn't really want to stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But after a while he stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And then from there we left to _6d_, and we were there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And from there, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we were there for awhile, and from there we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eschwege</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And from there we left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ; in 1949, we came here.</span></p>
